>But while students are suffering financially, the state‚Äôs universities are feeling money pressure too ‚Äî at least compared to their peers. From 2010 to 2015, Texas ranked last in the nation in total per-student revenue growth at its colleges and universities, according to a study by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.

>That‚Äôs thanks in part to the shrinking number of dollars per student that Texas is sending its universities. In recent years, enrollment has exploded. Lawmakers in anti-tax Texas have been unwilling or unable to continue funding students‚Äô educations at the same rate as a generation ago. And the Legislature has allowed universities to increase tuition to make up the difference. ¬†

https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/07/texas-tuition-increasing-state-funding-falling/

The State of Texas is run by a mass of anti-intellectual, anti-college fundamentalists at the gubernatorial and congressional levels. Not all of the State's elected officials would love to strangle one of the greatest mechanisms for individual growth and the breaking down of barriers and biases that exists, but a lot of them would.

I hated going to class, I hated waking up every day. I felt an intense visceral loathing for everyone- all the rich kids who went to fancy high schools, etc. (I know that's not everyone, but I was just jealous and bitter).  It was so overwhelming.

 I had some sort of nervous breakdown before midterms every single month due to acute stress, was hospitalized, yada yada.

hsc07u,fy9jj97,"From the linked article, which I had to go search up because you can't click screenshots:

> Students whose health insurance doesn‚Äôt cover the cost of a coronavirus test or who don‚Äôt have insurance can receive a subsidy through the university to eliminate the cost of the test, said Ellie Breed, a university spokesperson. Faculty and staff tests are covered by university health insurance.

That's still not great (extra paperwork and whatnot) but it's certainly not as bad as the tweet makes it out to be.

What I'm curious about is who the heck actually pays for these tests then. Is this just a way for the school to get money from students who have outside insurance? Because that seems like an awful, *awful* source of revenue relative to the potential downsides.",77,gnosnivek,2

But nope. This fucking sucks. I didn't realize being in a class with people i sparsely spoke to would be so much better than in my room in front of desk

I advise you make a calendar and stick to it. Like, all assignments, lectures etc. Its easier to fall behind with online lectures because in many cases, lecture attendance isn't required and you still have access to it later if you skip, so u push it of to do it later. And eventually it piles up and by the time important deadline is close enough, its too late. Its easier for procrastinator to procrastinate when its possible to push things, like online lectures, to later time.

Solution, stick to calendar, get to lectures EVEN IF you could get away with not doing it.",176,H_psi_E_psi,1
