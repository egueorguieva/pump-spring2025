hr1ttn,fy1fla7,"Being a landlord doesn’t necessarily have to be dishonest, it’s a solid investment that many decent people make. The problem is Aspen Ridge Management and other property management companies in Provo that take advantage of students’ lack of familiarity with renters’ rights. BYU should really offer a 1 credit class on renters’ rights so that students can stop being taken advantage of. That or a lawyer needs to round up a bunch of students and bring a class action lawsuit on some of these places.",29,None,1
hr1ttn,fy1yh0z,"Renting in Provo sucked. I hated Aspen Ridge. They treated their tenants so poorly. My roommate got extra charges for cleaning they never did. They kept offering to reduce the fee, even though they never did the work. It took him months to get the charges taken off, and only after he worked with dispute resolution. 

Then I moved to Montana. I live in an apartment above my landlord (he owns the house and I rent the upstairs apartment). MAN! It’s such a world of difference. I will never go back, if I can avoid it, to a management company. Such a scam. This guy is chill as can be, rent and utilities are paid on Venmo (no screwy processing fees or “utility bill handling fees” jacking up your monthly cost). When your landlord knows you (and you know your landlord personally) the relationship is way better and there is trust. And you actually get rewarded for being a good tenant rather than being treated like a criminal in all cases and disputes.

I don’t think there was anything in Provo that caused me so much stress as the garbage housing system.",21,None,2

By going to BYU we consent to following the rules of the honor code, but we don’t consent to inappropriate questions regarding mistakes we have made. The honor code office should not have the power to pull your ecclesiastical endorsement after you’ve repented and your bishop says you are okay. The honor code office is encouraging students to not go through the process of repentance for fear of being expelled, which only promotes sin. How is it that we can work through issues with our bishop and be okay with the Lord, but the “Lord’s school” can say we didn’t repent enough and punish us for it? ",45,babsy18,1

bpe31y,eorvlh7,"Until the church’s stance against homosexuality becomes a societal liability that affects tithing, public relations, and ultimately gaining new members, the old guard will continue to push this agenda. Look back to the priesthood “revelation” of 1978 with respect to the civil rights movement.

This is plainly humans controlling what privileges other humans have. By encouraging the ostracization of Mormon homosexuals on Earth and promising worse in the Celestial Kingdom, it’s pretty clear that fear is being weaponized against the very people it was meant to protect.

Does nobody else see the danger in supporting and giving in to this type of groupthink? I would argue there is morbid responsibility in supporting the power structure that reflects the misguided ideals of the few over the acceptance of many.

Why is it so important if other people are following the Honor Code or not? I’ve always thought that it is important for us to focus on what we believe and follow. Who cares what the other person decides to do? He has his own relationship with deity. And I guess, how does breaking the Honor Code make you less of a question.

With that, the tuition is subsidized by the tithing of the Church's members. With exception of the beard rule, the rest of the honor code if being a faithful member. It doesn't mean you can't make mistakes. I've worked through some major transgressions with my ecclesiastical leader while maintaining my enrollment at BYU.

NEVER LIVE HERE OR ANY REDSTONE MANAGED COMPLEX!!!! This review is as of 10/23/2020. The management is awful. Just in the last two months I’ve lived here I’ve never had as bad of an experience at an apartment than I have now. As of this morning, they booted at least 20 people’s cars after zero notice. No email or anything. I called and texted with no answer. Finally went by the office and they said they did “everything they could” to give us notice, which was nothing. Not even exaggerating.

Also, our toilet was broken when we got here and was constantly running, and pouring out water. Many, many attempts to reach the management both in person and virtually resulted in absolutely nothing. After a month of this, our bill was an extra $40 for just water. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!

Also don’t even try to contact them, I’ve tried email, text, phone call and in person, and have only seen them once. That was today lol.

***edit: I woke up early to get the boot off my car and it already got towed 🙃. What kind of management tows their own tenants (and a student at that) car after no notice?",27,averagesizechungus,1
jx8jc5,gcuyil6,"Oh, let me share a story about my time at the Rivera (2 years ago) who is ~~owned~~ *managed* by Redstone Residential. My thoughts at the time of the events are in italics.

My year-long contract there was hell. Don't get me wrong, I loved my roommates and the ward but the management was shady on a good day. Every month we had a cleaning check, whatever I usually had the kitchen to clean as my job. I scrubbed the hell out of that thing every month and I failed at least 6 of the 12 cleaning checks during the year. They looked for any reason to fail you. Funny thing is, they never told you what it was that you failed for. So when the recheck happens like a few days later, they would fail me again and charge me an extra $35 for a ""cleaning"" crew to come. I stuck around all day twice for the ""cleaning crew"" to come. Once it was the main office staff and they cleaned nothing, the second no one showed up. I could have sworn the checkers were paid per fail they gave to cleaning checks with how fail-happy they were.

My final month comes around and I ask the front office if I have to pay my last month's rent and they confidently say ""Yes!"". I wasn't sure if I paid last month's rent in the deposit or not so I asked them to check and they said, No you have to pay last month's rent. So I write the check and didn't think to make sure until a few days later when I checked the contract. I asked for the money back and of course, I had to jump through 1000 hoops to get my damn money back.

And after leaving my miserable experience didn't stop. You know that all-important deposit that complexes force out of you and tell you a certain amount is ""refundable""? Yeah, good luck prying that from their greedy hands when it's time to leave. Final check day came, I left the stupid addressed envelope, stamp, etc. that they ""need"" (otherwise they charge you $3 for it! lol).  About two months pass and I still haven't seen the refundable part of my deposit. So I call the Rivera. They tell me ""Oh, there was an issue with the printer here and YOURS didn't get printed"" (*wonder how many other people's checks ""didn't get printed""*). So they told me to wait a few days, I waited, no one called me back. So I called them, they said they still are having printer issues, (*yeah sure you are*). So they tell me to call/email Redstone about the issue. So I email Redstone Residential and get into a bit of an email battle with the secretary. I wrote her saying that I still hadn't gotten my refunded deposit back, oh, and that last month's rent I paid but I didn't need to. So after almost a week she finally tells me that she will get on it but that she will deduct $50 because I ""failed the final cleaning check"" (*oh WOW, you don't say! /s*). I finally convinced her to give me that damn $50 because they had already gotten $100+ from me during the freaking school year. Then the best part, she also tells me that they are having ""printer issues"" and that I need to come down to the main office to pick up my check. You would think that with the amount of money they took from me for cleaning checks they could fix their damn printers! (*Imagine if I lived outside of the Provo/Orem area during the summer...*) Finally got my money... after 3 months of lots of pestering them.

TLDR;

I was forced to pay a stupid amount of money for monthly cleaning checks that felt like a coin toss. Redstone Residential and other property management companies attempt to swindle any money they can out of the residents. When it came time to uphold their end of the contract and return my refundable portion of the deposit, they looked for any reason to not return the money or keep as much of it as possible.",19,Cholojuanito,2
jx8jc5,gcv8oz9,"The way I see it is this:

In the early 2010s when Redstone was founded they recognized the potential to essentially corner the housing market in Provo. Independent complex owners were getting older and looking to cash out and move on with their grandkids etc. They probably got some venture capital and started buying up complexes and houses as they went up for sale. 

What happened next was some pretty impressive growth. From what I could find, in 2013 they were managing 1,300 beds. Now in 2020 they are in the 20,000s. They look like the future of Provo housing, and in my opinion that future is going up--in the quite literal sense. Land is becoming more scarce, I bet that in the next couple years we will see a lot more homes and entire blocks bought out south of campus and big complexes built there.",13,butt-hole-eyes,3

I do know we lived near the base of that mountain,  we could walk from our house to the trailhead.  I also remember as a kid riding our bikes in the neighborhood.  I do remember a water park being built,  7 peaks resort I think is what it was called near that area.  I just don’t remember Y mountain being so close to BYU.  I remember there used it be horses there and feeding them apples and sugar cubes as a kid.  There was also a weird swamp before  7 peaks was built that we used to catch frogs and snakes.  During the winter, deer would come down and sniff through the snow to get at the grass for food.  It was actually a magical childhood.  We would also hike that same mountain and there would be grapes and plums we would pick and make home made jam from them.
This was 1987-1989ish.   But you know, childhood memories as a kid are way different.  Adults I remember being giants are not anymore, lol.

I think the biggest problem lies in the fact that the HCO steps in on matters of *sin*, not just university misconduct. And without the calling and mantle that Bishops have, they mandate things that interfere with or overshadow some of the fundamental precepts of the gospel (the atonement/repentance process). 

I think it makes sense to leave the matters of eternal importance to Bishops (with keys and callings), let the police handle illegal matters (sexual assault, theft, drug abuse), and keep the more university policy stuff with the HCO (plagiarism, academic dishonesty, etc). Obviously committing a crime would call your standing at the university into question, but if Bishops truly are the judges in Israel, why is the HCO weighing in on matters of sin?",31,Krombopulous_Michele,1

I agree that cheating is bad, but if you think this will stop it you are kidding yourself. There are reddit threads full of advice on how to get away with cheating using proctorio.

j9xp7g,g8p0opb,"BYU offers a course on Sociology of Gender (SOC 367) for anyone interested in learning the scientific understanding of gender. The term “gender” means something different in the scientific community than it does in LDS vernacular; here’s how the key terms are defined in the scientific community:
1. Sex: refers to a person’s physical anatomy; their DNA (XX, XY, etc.) and sex organs (penis, vagina, etc.). This is the scientific term that comes closest to the LDS definition of gender. Most people’s biological sex is either male or female, but there are lots of intersex people who don’t fit cleanly into either category.
2. Sexuality: refers to who a person is romantically attracted to. Some possible sexualities are heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, etc.
3. Gender: refers to the roles/expectations that a culture assigns to males vs. females, and how an individual identifies with those roles. Exists on a scale of masculine to feminine, but what is considered masculine or feminine can vary greatly across cultures. When scientists say that gender is “fluid”, it is because different cultures have different understandings of what is masculine or feminine, and a single individual might act in both masculine and feminine ways depending on the context. For example, the same individual might act in stereotypically masculine ways when playing in a soccer match, but act in stereotypically feminine ways when caring for a newborn baby.

This test question from the OP constitutes a “crapstorm” because, no matter which of these three terms we look at, we find more than 2 binary options. When looking at Sex, there are [many possible conditions](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/intersex-spectrum/) where people don’t fit cleanly into either category of male or female. In terms of Sexuality, people are not always romantically attracted to their opposite gender. And in terms of Gender, people don’t always identify with the gender roles/expectations that their society puts on them, not to mention that we all act in both masculine and feminine ways depending on the setting.

* Classes are canceled on the 13th, 16th, and 17th.  After this, classes will resume using some for of remote instructions (online).  This is being left to professors to handle. 
* The testing center will stay open until all tests currently open are finished (which will happen by Wednesday).  After this, the center will remain closed until further notice. Only 100 people will be allowed to take tests at a time. They are encouraging students to take tests ASAP to avoid massive waits. 
* BYU is encouraging students to travel home.  Not like back to your apartment, but like actual home.  They recognize that this will be hard/impossible for lots of people. 
* Campus will stay open during all of this 
* We DON'T know exactly how this will affect on-campus jobs.  BYU has left this up to the discretion of supervisors etc... We have some people in the comments saying that their boss has already told them they will all still be working, but everything seems to be case by case.  Obviously (hopefully) if you are sick, don't go to work.
* Graduation is cancelled. So are concerts, devotionals, athletic events, etc... Basically anything with a large gathering.
* Not only are athletic events on BYU canceled, all NCAA events are canceled ( [https://twitter.com/NCAA/status/1238197201928667136](https://twitter.com/NCAA/status/1238197201928667136) )
* Zoom ([zoom.byu.edu](https://zoom.byu.edu)) is available to all BYU students/employees for online group meetings if you need to talk to your team project etc...
