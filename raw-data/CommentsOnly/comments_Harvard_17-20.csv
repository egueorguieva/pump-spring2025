Sometimes this can be tough because people want to talk about things that aren't relevant to your announcement. Getting a Harvard phone case and setting a 7 minute timer is key, if it hasn't come up within the first 6 mins, go ahead and pull up your phone so they can see it and Google whatever subject they are talking about and Harvard, there will usually be something that pops up and work that into the conversation quickly.",95,Nickbarc,3

I mostly got better after freshman year, but still, my unweighted GPA was not very much above 3.5.  I don't remember what it was, exactly.  Long time ago.

ija9di,g3czy0a,"I know who three of those people are, but I was never in that group. I was in another group though and I remember just watching the drama unfold and asking myself how those idiots got into Harvard in the first place. It was a really big deal at the time and I know a few people deactivated their social media accounts for a while, I'm assuming because they probably had posted offensive things when they were younger and they didn't want that coming back to bite them in the tush. 

With all of that being said, I'm not upset that they get to pursue higher education at top universities without the world knowing what they did. Today's cancel culture is brutal and everything is set in stone, or on Twitter. No matter how much a person apologizes and how hard they commit to changing themselves, very few people will see it as genuine and their name will forever be tied to something moronic they said online. Although change and education should be something you do for yourself, not for the sake of restoring your reputation, clearing your name is still important for any future endeavors. Harvard was absolutely right to cut ties with them, I supported that decision back then and I support it now, just like I support the anonymity of those involved. 

Don't get me wrong, being 17 doesn't excuse their behavior, especially in today's world. But I think it's okay that they got to move on, all we can do now is hope that being told to fuck off by Harvard was a learning experience. I know some people were upset that they ""got away without consequences"", but I'd argue that being set back for a whole year and not being able to attend the university you really wanted to attend is an appropriate consequence for their action of creating offensive memes.",40,pinkstardust007,1

ips9mk,g4lq2sx,"I think the e-learning model of ""commenting"" on posts and video responses is counterproductive. I really think that is why online education has a bad reputation. I think some instructors are taking a flawed model of online education and bringing it to Harvard.  I have taken online classes like this at another university and this type of education really did not feel good.

That classes as HES are not like that in my opinion. With the exception of one class, all my classes followed a normal schedule of weekly meetings, papers, Zoom session, breakout groups, etc.

I think the type of online education you are describing would frustrate me to no end. While the online technology environment has transferred from HES, I think some teaching lessons and methods have not. TBH, it has got to be hard on instructors & TF's making the shift online also.

It is frustrating, but hopefully you can get back to in-person classes soon.

We’re I HC, I’d honestly look at the profs that have been teaching HES for several terms.  By and large, they’re fantastic and make the online option engaging to the point where there’s little difference between the in-person classroom and the virtual.

Hang in there, and provide honest feedback. As the greenhorn-to-online-learning profs get some experience, and embrace constructive criticism, it will get better.  IMO, in addition to the technical experience HES provided the other schools of HU, they should have had the top 10 HES instructors teach “How to teach via Zoom” classes to all the newbs.

Harvard pushed back. 

Why? Because harvard wants to protect two things. legacy whites and rich blacks. While the URM increase in the aforementioned policy would happen, it would be driven by an increase in latino numbers from present levels and a slight decrease in black numbers.

Not sure what organizations you comped, but my observation was that those are extremely difficult to pass as a frosh or even sophomore.

Lastly, I can guarantee that *elis* are the last people you should be jealous of. Same pressure cooker environment, just in another state (and a way shittier campus).

c1qr7a,erf1c0h,"100% agree with this decision. Kashuv says he's being proactive by emailing the office of diversity about his actions, but why was he not proactive with acknowledging and rectifying his offensive comments *before* they were made public and broadcasted on media? He is only ""remorseful"" because he got caught with these messages coming to light. This is not about politics. There are plenty of conservative, pro-gun students enrolled at Harvard. This is about rescinding a student who said some truly racist, hateful things. The last time Harvard rescinded admissions it was about those kids posting offensive memes. This case seems much the same. His excuse that he was  just 16, immature, and never-intending to do harm is laughable. No one cares about your intentions - the effects, outcomes, and perception of your actions are what matter.

He also criticizes Harvard for not recognizing that someone can ""grow and learn from their actions."" Nowhere did Harvard say that it doesn't believe in a person's capacity to grow.

But if you're a teenager, remember that you may be a minor with respect to the law, but your words and actions are the main things that an admissions committee could use to judge your true character -- not just the way you present yourself on a (highly coached) application. 

I fully support the decision to rescind this admission. The applicant said he wanted to kill jews, for goodness sake. That's not a slip of the tongue.

At Harvard, when people around you are constantly hitting huge benchmarks on their own projects, there's a lot of pressure to cut corners in this journey—to pick projects based on how impressive they'll look on your resumé, to achieve for the sake of achieving rather than because you care about what you're working on.

Drew Pendergrass just had a nice column [in *Harvard* magazine](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2020/09/jhj-undergraduate-to-catch-crawdad) on this, where he proposes that pandemic isolation can be an opportunity to recalibrate your sense of rhythm and meaning by taking cues from the natural world instead of Harvard's turbo-speed academic grind.

8re2ay,e0rft8z,"The alumni who interviewed the Asian applicants say that their personality are the same as other races, but the actual admissions folks who DIDN'T interview the Asian applicants still gave them a lower personality score? Lol, wut?",51,PurpleCopper,1
8re2ay,e0r8wn4,"If Harvard's defense is that Asian applicants rank lower on personality traits and this is the root cause of a lower than otherwise expected admissions rate, and the plaintiffs choose to meet them head on regarding this point, which it seems they want to do, then the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that Asian applicants as a group are objectively not weaker in this category. 

Based on an inexperienced reading of their filing (IANAL) it does not appear that they have done this. Rather instead, they have demonstrated that Asian applicants receive lower scores in this area, (using some definitely janky non-standard mathematics, but Harvard does not really dispute it) and then imply that because these ratings are subjective, they must be lower as a result of discrimination. They dismiss out of hand Harvard's witness's contention that Asian applicants are actually weaker in this category, calling it, ""offensive racial sterotyping... legally and factually untenable."" Stereotyping or not, they have to prove it to be false, and that's actually really really hard to do. 

Quotes from leadership who are not directly involved in admissions are not weighty, and it is not hard to think of explanations for why admissions-office ratings can differ from alumni-interviewer ratings. Instead, the plaintiffs try to push the burden of proof onto the defendant, asking Harvard's witness to present a non-race explanation for the lower personality trait scores. While his refusal to do so constitutes a weak defense, it is still plausibly coherent, and the plaintiffs must pierce it themselves. If they are unable to do so, then I'm not sure they have much of a case. 

***

Sideways from the legal stuff, it is clear that Harvard has a system that they implement that consistently produces the student body that they desire. The plaintiffs believe that the process should be different, resulting in a different student body composition. Who gets to make that kind of decision, and how much control should the government have over it? These are some really interesting questions that are going to get answered as all of this plays out.

8re2ay,e0tlbyt,"So I'm one of those Asians with a  perfect sat score, high class rank + national level competitions/ extracurriculars in math and the social sciences, that likely got rejected due to  the caps 10 years ago. Also I didn't realize it until college but my family was dirt poor compared to my peers (waiter + post-doc salary).  


Ultimately all the Ivies rejected me but luckily I got into another school with similar but not quite as  good career outcomes (like 25&#37; of class goes to iBanking and Management  consulting vs like 40&#37; at Harvard or Princeton). In particular I remember my  UPenn alumni interview went really really well and I was devastated when  I was waitlisted. Also was bitter for a while because Cornell didn't take  me but took my best friend who was an A- student with 300 pts lower on the SAT than me but White.  
10 years later none of this matters much to my career but I can't help but think how different my future would've looked if I went to a non-target school instead. I likely would've ended up pursuing a career in Engineering or Medicine as opposed to Finance simply because the recruiting networks weren't there.   
If Edward Blum wins his case and proves there were racial quotas of around  20&#37; of class for asian americans at most super-selective colleges, will there be class action lawsuits that harmed students can sign up for?  
Also do yall think this would shift the dial on mba admissions at HBS? I would be very happy if the courts forced universities to publish similar data for their business school with race + gender that something reputable like Propublica or Brookings can dive into and analyze. Based on facebook posts (not a great representative sample which is why I want official data) I have like \~10 female asian finance/consulting friends who've gotten into HBS or Stanford GSB in recent years vs like \~0 asian males with similar careers (but the asian guys are still getting into other schools like Michigan or Booth).

Of course the topics covered in Math 55 are eventually covered later in other courses. In fact, math 55 mostly covers sophomore level math. So it's not particularly advanced; it just moves fast as is a good challenge. 

It is not common for undergrads to stay there for the PhD. The reason is that they want you to explore other places and do math somewhere else. However, if you demonstrate a particular interest in working with a professor there, they are okay with that. But it is still very hard to gain admission!

The material is supposed to be roughly the same (except much more) as in the other freshman math classes -- multivariable calculus and linear algebra -- except that the material is approached in a much deeper way and the problems are much more challenging and interesting.  You should take Math 55 if you're God's gift to mathkind, because Math 55 is designed to still greatly challenge you at that level, where all other math classes covering the same material will be less challenging and thus less interesting.  Math 55 is why those people go to Harvard, because they want to have the experience of this class.  But if you're only a mortal, it might just be *too* hard to be as rewarding as it is for them.

I have no idea what things are like now because I'm old, and I have even less idea what things are like now because of COVID, but if they're at all similar to when I was an incoming freshman, there will be *plenty* of help on hand to guide you in figuring out which math courses to take.  55 might be for you, or it might not.

Here's the archived webpage. The professor apparently took it down.

I took a quick read, here's some of the content he had:

> A “hate hoax” is an act of hate — racist graffiti, a threatening note — which is a hoax in the sense that it was perpetrated by a member (or ally) of the class of people it purports appears to attack. See Pro Publica and Reason for discussion and examples. Let’s review some examples from Williams history:

> January 1993: Three (anti-black) racist slurs posted on the door of Rice House. Perpetrator turned out to an African-American student. He was suspended for one semester.

> September 2001: Female student reports that she was assaulted in her dorm room. Turns out that she made the whole thing up. I do not think that this truly qualifies as a hate hoax since her intent was probably not to stir up a campus controversy about sexual assault. See discussion below for whether or not the intent of the perp should matter for defining an event as a hate hoax.

> November 2011: Racist note — All Niggers Must Die — attached to a door in Prospect House. Perpetrator was (almost certainly) an African-American/Hispanic student activist. She was not punished and, to this day, the College maintains the public fiction that this was an actual hate crime.

> November 2012: Racist statement — All beaners must die — written on whiteboard in Mission. Perpetrator was of “Mexican descent.” As best I can tell, the student was not punished.

> November 2016: Racist graffiti — AMKKK, “meant to signify AmeriKKKa, a spelling of America that references racism in our society” — written in red paint in Griffin Hall. Three first year female African-American students were caught, all claiming (plausibly!) to have no connection to the KKK. Students were suspended but did return to Williams.

> Are there other examples I should include?

> As best I can tell, there are about as many hate hoaxes at Williams as there are actual hate crimes. What do readers estimate the proportions to be?

> Even the hate crimes that do not seem to be hoaxes — Williams E in 2008, Mills-Dennett 1 in 2009 and Paresky 2014 — often seem to be driven by animus whose original source has nothing directly to do with hate . . . but that is a discussion for another day.

I think insinuating that most hate crimes are actually perpetrated by the victims themselves is.... not the best thing. Jeez.

EDIT: another verbatim quote:

>“Committing crimes,” and almost everything else, is heavily influenced by your genes. Blood will tell. Does Cass not know about this literature? Does he really think that it all comes down to “values and beliefs?” Or does he know and disagree? Or does he agree and, yet, for reasons of prudence and cowardice, refuse to mention the role of genes in outcomes? Perhaps mentioning the unmentionable is why we have EphBlog?!

* Teach how to triage problems or assignment tasks, i.e. strategies to figure out how to approach a problem. For example, if it's a physics course, how do I figure out which equations are relevant for this problem?
* Give detailed, useful feedback when grading and/or provide a problem set answer key that clearly walks through the process to solving each problem.
* Make your office hours accessible. If it's at a time (or place were it not for remote learning) that's really inconvenient for students, nobody will show. Easier for you if nobody ever comes but not as helpful. If you see someone's struggling, specifically invite them to your office hours to walk through a few problems together.
* If appropriate to the course and you can manage it, think of ways to convey complex concepts that will be relatable to students' real-world intuition. I TFed a thermodynamics course, had some examples about weather that helped people mentally apply the concepts to think about daily life.
* Be aware that if your professor is particularly unskilled instructor (there are a few out there), students will get a lot of their practical learning through you.

Alternative is to use IEMs under ANC headphones. You won't hear a peep out of anyone.",14,Gzideck,1
f1kii1,fh726mq,"You haven't asked for recommendations on noise-canceling headphones, but I thought this might help you out.

Here are my 3 go-to's, in the order of my preference, along with my wife's favorite. Each of these has blue-tooth connectivity for both Apple and Android and also have the ability to connect to multiple blue-tooth devices. Overall, I recommend Sony products over BOSE or Jabra. Here are my personal rankings.

1- Sony WF-1000XM3 (Rose colored). These are in-ear headphones that do an awesome job at noise canceling. They are my primary noise-canceling earbuds/headphones because they perform almost as well as the BOSE below, but are much smaller and their charge lasts forever. You'll need to ensure you get a good fit with the ears though, and some folks won't like the feel of them. I've worn them for about 100 hours, and have never been left with dead batteries. Like most of the Sony products, they have transient, noise-canceling, and also normal modes. The problem is, the transient effect will switch to full-on noise-canceling causing a few seconds delay where you can't hear anything. If you are in an environment where you may need to hear someone randomly talking to you, this is a problem. However, if you use them in transient-mode while on the phone the folks listening to you won't notice. These are also the only USB-C rechargeable headphones on the list, which means they take less time to recharge and is probably why I've never had them go dead.

2 - BOSE Quiet Comfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth - These are over-the-ear headphones and dominated the noise-canceling arena for years. Because they are over the ear, they do a great job of canceling more noise than the in-ear types. The reason I don't like them as much as the sony WH-1000XM3's is I tend to sweat in my ears when wearing the BOSE.

3 - Jabra Elite Active 65t Earbuds - Normally, I would rate these well, but frankly, the fall out of my ears all the time. Also, the software to control them is crap. That said, they are my only waterproof pair, so you can't fault that. Also, for phone calls, I've found they fade in and out, and I usually need to switch to wired. So, fall out of the ear on airplanes and don't do well on calls... so next-to-last place.

Wife's Favorite: Sony WI-1000X My wife works in a noisy office environment that needs good noise-canceling. However, she also hates the ear-bud thing because she's concerned about losing them. I got her these and they are her daily driver.  She has the same transient-noise-canceling switch issue noted for the earbuds in #1 above.

TLDR: Sony makes great products, and I recommend either the WF-1000XM3 (if you want earbuds) or the Sony WI-1000X (if you want something more secure). I recommend BOSE quiet comfort if you want over-the-ear headphones. If you exercise and want an earbud with noise-canceling that is waterproof, the Jabra Elite is a great choice as long as you make sure you get a good fit in your ear.

Edit: Changed the nomenclature of the headphones to WF-1000XM3. Thank you u/TheGrammarBolshevik",4,OmnemVeritatem,2

eoe0uq,fecnm92,"I consider myself a strong supporter of journalism, I wrote for my school paper in high school in which I covered issues like trans rights in my town and a local fight to halt a federal energy project. I respect journalism and believe it is a tool for good. That being said...

Journalists do have a moral obligation to protect people they report upon when those people are clearly vulnerable in the situation. War journalists do this often, as do political journalists who use deep background and other methods to protect sources. It’s not very difficult, when a journalist approaches a conflict between two sides, to evaluate the power imbalance between the sides and adjust tactics accordingly. 

Given ICE’s (and related agencies) history of silencing dissidents and targeting of university students (see: MIT this week), the Crimson should have understood that blindly reaching out to ICE compromises the safety of students. The Crimson should OF COURSE strive to voice an alternative opinion, but they should have done so via more ethical journalistic methods. The most simple means of doing this is developing a source within the agency for comment on how it’s reacting without simply reaching out to the agency as a whole. This is pretty standard practice when working on sensitive topics. Journalists, professional or student, cannot pretend they have no obligation to protect those they report upon. Especially when one party in a conflict has a history of retributive terror, it betrays basic journalistic ethics to highlight to that party the vulnerable people who oppose it.

Bottom line, I do actually believe Crimson was in the wrong here. You can argue the student response is overly hostile, but that is a separate argument. The Crimson shirked journalistic responsibility, and instead of apologizing for this mistake (which, imo, would have hopefully set things right) decided to double down on the poor practice of their reporter. 

That being said, I wish OP no ill will. I’m glad you’ve found a community on campus and I, too, would like to see relationships between the Crimson and the activist wing of campus restored. But to do that, the Crimson has to admit it did something wrong.",5,None,2

I got in, loved my time there, my parents feel more of a shared connection with the school now. I can even say that if my child one day was well qualified and they rejected them, they can forget about any donations or me helping the school out as an alumni. This is what they are worried about. Having a strong alumni network is hugely important for many reasons. Having a bunch of alumni who feel slighted right around when their career potential at its peak is horrible for a school.

fttepp,fmyc5lv,"Harvard v. Brown

Not 100% sure what I want to do, but I’m going into chem and will probably end up doing pre med (or something related to medicine/drugs... probably not engineering tho)

So I’ve narrowed down options to the two schools I mentioned.

I was set set on Brown (accepted after being deferred), but I was shocked when I got into Harvard. The thing is, I love Browns laid back culture, but Harvard is Harvard and I can’t get past the prestige. If I decide to change my major, I don’t want to look back and regret passing up on H.

Besides location and prestige, I think Brown’s laid back culture would be somewhat of a better fit for me— and the open curriculum allow me some wiggle room if I decide to do something other than chem. I also come from a lower income background, and heard wealth plays a large role in the social culture at Harvard which wouldn’t be good for me lol. Also, apparently H professors are more focused on research than teaching?
