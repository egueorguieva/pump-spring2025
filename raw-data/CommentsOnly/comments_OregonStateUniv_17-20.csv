City council said ""our PD does not have the resources to be the party patrol"" and makes it a 'recommendation' instead. 

Why did OSU invite thousands of students to live on (and off) campus? Money > health. Same as ever, they put the burden of solving hard problems on the City of Corvallis (housing comes to mind).

It's still a shit situation for the university though, for example they have cut the salary of every employee making above $50k (the rate of cutting increases with salary up to 12% at $222k) because they have a projected defecit of $50 million this year.

On the other side, the Corvallis economy would not be nearly what it is without the university (obviously). If no students came back, many businesses would need to close permanently (and might still from what I've been reading).

Not saying ANYTHING justifies OSU's piss poor response to the situation, just highlighting that it is a nuanced issue.

Specific majors had their own web instances, vs a whole college/department having their own instance; Graduate school had one guy at one point managing their end of the site (I helped migrate their shit to a new Drupal instance as an assistant back in 2016).

Seems pretty cut and dry. She resisted arrest, so they dropped her(relatively softly tbh) to the grass to put on cuffs. I‚Äôm not going to comment on if she deserved to be arrested in the first place, but thinking that there was any racial injustice here or police overreaction is ignorant and simply incorrect, imo.

*she repeats this a bit*

*officers lay her down on her stomach*

> please let me sit up by myself

> no.

*conversation is repeated a few times*

*women again says she will not answer questions, just like she‚Äôs been saying since the beginning of the video*

> can you stop touching me?

*officer continues to hold on to her arm with the one hand*
> no. 

> can you stop touching me? It‚Äôs making uncomfortable.

*officer releases her*

> can I sit up?

> no.

*moves a bit, can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs trying to get up or not*

> don‚Äôt try to get up.

*women calls out to bystanders, asking for someone to send their mother a ‚Äúvideo or something‚Äù. Phone numbers(multiple, because she gives the incorrect phone number first) are bleeps out.*

*3rd officer arrives to keep back the bystanders that keep walking up behind the officer with the women*.

*women again asks to sit up a few times. Officer again denies the request.*

*4th officer arrives. First officer explains why she is under arrest to the officer, and the 2nd officer tells the 4th officer to be mindful of the cuffs, because they were put on very lightly/softly, since he didn‚Äôt want to hurt her wrists.*

*there are more than just 4 officers now, but 5 and 6 don‚Äôt seem to do anything.*

*4th officer notifies the arrested women she is here to do the search, because she is a female officer.*

> can I stand up?

> I would like you to get up.

*again, officers hold her as she gets up, and again, she protests being touched(however, she only calls out against the male, not the female officer)*

*again, asks to not be touched. Officer has to tell her that, since she is in custody, she won‚Äôt be waking on her own.*

To me, it seems like the main issue is the women both didn‚Äôt want to speak to the police(which is perfectly legal, but you can be detained for this. However, there is nothing wrong with someone enacting their right to be silent or following [STFU Friday](https://youtu.be/JTurSi0LhJs)) and also constantly spoke out about being detained. 

If she had answered the original questions, she *probably* wouldn‚Äôt have been detained(see the beginning of this comment for the quotes about why she was arrested). Maybe identifying herself somehow would have notified the police that she was dangerous or wanted, but I doubt it. Also, if she hadn‚Äôt attempted to stand up on her own and then explicitly stated she would ‚Äúrather lay down‚Äù, she would have been sitting normally on the curb, which would have been much more comfortable(emotionally, I don‚Äôt mean feel better sitting on a hard curb than laying in grass).

he2efw,fvoq9rw,"As a faculty member at OSU working to try to fix some of these problems, you have my sincere sympathy. 

There are many structural challenges, but one of the largest in my opinion is the focus on research: the university hires tenure track professors so that they will bring research funding to increase revenue (OSU charges overhead on any grants they bring in). Yet part of their position is also to teach - the idea is that since they're doing research, they can also teach the subject effectively. Sadly, this is a false assumption. Most professors are not taught how to teach, which is surprising because the results of research on teaching and learning are easy enough to incorporate in most cases. Additionally, if they don't bring in enough funding, they may either not receive their salary, or they may be turned down for tenure, which is basically a seven-year test that you can rarely get the chance to try and take again. This makes many prioritize their research over everything else.

What ends up happening to may professors is that they try to fumble through their first few classes. It doesn't go well. They get horrible evals, and then blame students for being lazy or disinterested. 

But, you can advocate for yourself. Leave very descriptive comments in your course evals. And sign them! Contact the associate Dean or Dean of the college and complain. You are a consumer. Make sure people know you are not satisfied with their product. You can also try talking to the person directly, but many are defensive and assume the problem is on your end. 

Again, some of us are working to try and fix this, but it's an uphill battle. It's also not the only problem, of course. But it's funny: shouldn't we be somewhat responsible for student success?",61,Dr_Gonzoh,1
he2efw,fvotoax,"One of the things that also sucks when trying to deal with quality issues is that the college is so huge, the student community will have wildly different experiences. So some advocating for change may be speaking to students fortunate enough to have only had great teachers.

Whether it‚Äôs here, ratemyprofessor, or just talking to underclassmen or other people in your area of study about good/bad instructors or experiences. It‚Äôs been helpful to me to hear some of the recommendations of my upperclassmen. Then, sharing strategies of how to deal with poor teaching / curriculum, as the other commenter mentioned, through signed evals, contacting deans, contacting the instructor, or setting up personal methods to counteract their weak spots.

They let us save $4k by moving out of dorms, for those of us who are in dorms.

gtpbyn,fsdjh36,You don't have to be in Corvallis at all in the fall. They already announced that even classes that are held in-person will have a remote option for people that want to stay in their hometowns.,27,None,1
gtpbyn,fsdimsa,I think they will give us an option to learn remotely if we cannot or do not want to go back on campus in the fall for safety reasons. I am probably not going to rent housing for the fall since it would be ridiculous to live on campus to just attend one class for me.,18,SugaKookieMonsta,2
gtpbyn,fsebc8m,I am sad for incoming students on just about every level. If I were a fresh or soph I would do everything I could at a CC until I couldn't do more. Doing the 'four year experience' on campus has never made less sense. The school's (you can say this about every US school) over reliance on international students is a the 'chickens have come home to roost' moment.,12,epicrepairetime,3

dynany,f82e2jv,"At least we are better than places like University of Washington. They can accept you into the university, but not into the college, so you‚Äôll only be able to take baccalaureate course. You‚Äôd think if ‚Äútoo many students‚Äù was an issue, the solution would be adding more professors or expanding class sizes/number of sections.

As OSU themselves say...

> In addition, our enrollments have grown.  In order to preserve the student experience at Oregon State, a more competitive admissions process ‚Äì including the use of a waitlist, is necessary.

Hmmmm, yes, because the current university student experience is very well-loved. Can‚Äôt possibly change that...",15,Gcarsk,1

We'd love to have a talented student (or students) come up with a design and paint it on the wall over break or next term. The space is run by college of business and engineering so something design related to making things, engineering, running a business, startups and a just a general makerspace vibe would be wonderful. We'll supply anything and everything needed if we love your design and are happy to help if you need any suggestions. The wall space is about 6x12ft. Pm me if you're interested, thanks!
