Sometimes this can be tough because people want to talk about things that aren't relevant to your announcement. Getting a Harvard phone case and setting a 7 minute timer is key, if it hasn't come up within the first 6 mins, go ahead and pull up your phone so they can see it and Google whatever subject they are talking about and Harvard, there will usually be something that pops up and work that into the conversation quickly.",99,Nickbarc,3

I mostly got better after freshman year, but still, my unweighted GPA was not very much above 3.5.  I don't remember what it was, exactly.  Long time ago.  Also I did win lots of math competitions, so maybe my un-stellar GPA and SAT were ignored.  Long story short, my family wasn't rich enough to bribe anyone but I still got in.

ija9di,g3czy0a,"I know who three of those people are, but I was never in that group. I was in another group though and I remember just watching the drama unfold and asking myself how those idiots got into Harvard in the first place. It was a really big deal at the time and I know a few people deactivated their social media accounts for a while, I'm assuming because they probably had posted offensive things when they were younger and they didn't want that coming back to bite them in the tush. 

With all of that being said, I'm not upset that they get to pursue higher education at top universities without the world knowing what they did. Today's cancel culture is brutal and everything is set in stone, or on Twitter. No matter how much a person apologizes and how hard they commit to changing themselves, very few people will see it as genuine and their name will forever be tied to something moronic they said online. Although change and education should be something you do for yourself, not for the sake of restoring your reputation, clearing your name is still important for any future endeavors. Harvard was absolutely right to cut ties with them, I supported that decision back then and I support it now, just like I support the anonymity of those involved. 

Don't get me wrong, being 17 doesn't excuse their behavior, especially in today's world. But I think it's okay that they got to move on, all we can do now is hope that being told to fuck off by Harvard was a learning experience. I know some people were upset that they ""got away without consequences"", but I'd argue that being set back for a whole year and not being able to attend the university you really wanted to attend is an appropriate consequence for their action of creating offensive memes.",41,pinkstardust007,1

I think the type of online education you are describing would frustrate me to no end. While the online technology environment has transferred from HES, I think some teaching lessons and methods have not. TBH, it has got to be hard on instructors & TF's making the shift online also.

Lastly, I can guarantee that *elis* are the last people you should be jealous of. Same pressure cooker environment, just in another state (and a way shittier campus).

c1qr7a,erf1c0h,"100% agree with this decision. Kashuv says he's being proactive by emailing the office of diversity about his actions, but why was he not proactive with acknowledging and rectifying his offensive comments *before* they were made public and broadcasted on media? He is only ""remorseful"" because he got caught with these messages coming to light. This is not about politics. There are plenty of conservative, pro-gun students enrolled at Harvard. This is about rescinding a student who said some truly racist, hateful things. The last time Harvard rescinded admissions it was about those kids posting offensive memes. This case seems much the same. His excuse that he was  just 16, immature, and never-intending to do harm is laughable. No one cares about your intentions - the effects, outcomes, and perception of your actions are what matter.

&#x200B;

He also criticizes Harvard for not recognizing that someone can ""grow and learn from their actions."" Nowhere did Harvard say that it doesn't believe in a person's capacity to grow. Perhaps Harvard did see growth in Kashuv but did not deem it enough. Keep in mind that there are literally thousands of other applicants who are just as, *if not more*, qualified than Kashuv who did not say such offensive, hateful words.

c1qr7a,erfno6i,"All these various comments about lost freedom or things ""used against [him]"" are coming from a very entitled place. When you say awful things publicly in any context, you represent who you are. Nobody is responsible for your words except you. 

Of course we should forgive the remorseful, and I hate the notion that we all live on a cultural knife edge. But if you're a teenager, remember that you may be a minor with respect to the law, but your words and actions are the main things that an admissions committee could use to judge your true character -- not just the way you present yourself on a (highly coached) application. 

I fully support the decision to rescind this admission. The applicant said he wanted to kill jews, for goodness sake. That's not a slip of the tongue. That's not a benign childish joke or pushing the cultural envelope. That's beyond the pale, and I think we can all accept that nobody is entitled to admission at any particular school. Many eligible applicants did not, I assume, threaten to kill any group of people.",23,None,2

mqetpp,gugcc7v,"* PSY1002: Evoloving Morality: From Primordial Soup to Super Intelligent Machines 

(great ER gened, will teach you the ABCs of ethics and will give you a mental roadmap for the past and future)

* ER18: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Philosophy 

(another great ER gened, really makes you think about what matters at the end of the day. Strange as it sounds whenever I make big life choices I always reflect on the ideas of my favorite thinkers from this class)

* EC10a/b: Intro to Economics 

(will change how you think about society - esp. if you come from a sciences background. great AMHIST gened)

* CS50: Intro to CS 

(I chose a CS concentration last minute due to taking this class sophomore year. You will know if you like CS after taking CS50. If you're really not sure going in then you can get around the difficulty by going pass/fail)

* EC1723: Capital Markets 

(A weird one I know. But similarly to Ec10 it will change how you think about society and how/why money flows to certain places and not others. If you work in tech/finance you will sound like a genius after taking this one class. Whenever I make life decisions about buying/renting, investing, etc. I can confidently make up my mind because I took this one class)

(Warning because the professor changes semi-frequently so be sure the prof has decent reviews. I believe the slides stay mostly the same between profs so that's nice)

* Most freshman seminars in a topic you care about will also be very impactful.

* Some concentrations have Junior seminars. A good one here can also be very impactful espeically if you're trying to get into a lab or go to grad school.

EDIT: Also CS179 Design of Useful and Interactive Computer Systems is basically a UX/UI design class and is very fun. It's a relatively fluffy course you can count towards a CS concentration, and you'll learn so much about working in teams. I use lessons learned from this class in my job every day.",15,radar3699,3

pgozep,hbdoorr,"I don't know if this will help but: first, I was rejected from Harvard (and Yale and Hopkins) for undergrad. I always did well through high school, and that first time being rejected from something I really wanted hurt. But I also went to another good school, and I learned a lot - and now I'm at Harvard for grad school. Which is one way of saying that the outcome of undergrad admissions doesn't really say anything about what you're going to accomplish in the years after that. Presumably I didn't get a very good Harvard Score. That is what it is. I'm still doing fine.

Maybe a more helpful way of thinking about it is also this: in the time I've now been a TF/Phd student here, I've learned more about the way things like admissions works - and it's not exactly pretty. Even just reading applications for a particular *course*\--not even for the university, just one class!--was really weird! Way more people submitted applications than we could have accepted, and almost all of them were stellar. Anyone probably would have succeeded in the class. But we could only admit so many students, so we had to somehow make choices--based on just a few paragraphs worth of an application. Getting from 150 applications to 100 students meant all kinds of hair-splitting and scoring and quick judgement calls based on what was ultimately not that much information. And you know what: some of the students who ""scored"" highest kind of struggled. And some of those who got admitted off the wait list turned out to be the strongest students. I won't say that the process was totally arbitrary--but the sense that you get of a student based on an application isn't always an accurate sense of who that student is. Sometimes you get the wrong read; sometimes things that actually don't say anything about a student's ability to succeed become determining factors, just because you have to find *some reason* to justify making the choice you do. For better or worse.

And that's true of the bigger admissions process, too. The image a committee got of you from an application isn't going to be accurate. It just isn't. All those scores really say is how the things you wrote (which, by the way, are *not*  ""you""; they're just things you wrote at a particular moment) fit into the template of a ""Harvard student,"" based on how the handful of people who read your application read it. Which, you know, whatever. That doesn't say anything about who you actually are.

And let me also just say: I've taught a lot of students who are clearly the Harvard Template(TM). All kinds of insanely intimidating things they've done that make them super distinctive. People who worked on the early 2020 Covid response (as high schoolers ?!?!), people who've already published major books with big publishing houses, people who've spent substantial time in DC contributing to legislation. Impressive stuff. Stuff I don't even dream of doing now! But they struggle in their own ways, too. They're still learning a lot about different things too. And it's fine. Everyone has their competencies, and everyone has things they struggle with. Sometimes those competencies might seem more distinctive - but it's hard to tell anything from a surface. And anyway, there are other things that are important, too.

Which is a really long way of saying: don't let this get to you. Just do you (though don't be afraid to push yourself or step out of your comfort zones!). As you said, you clearly did well in the interview - which suggests to me you're good at talking with people. So talk with people. Talk with your TFs and your professors when you can - many of them (/us) see things that admissions committees don't see as we get a chance to know you. And we're very glad we get to.

Good luck.",30,haltheincandescent,2

What is this, a suggestion on r/2007scape?

It doesn't ""devalue our diploma"" as we knew what we were signing up for when we entered HES, applied for student status, and continued to pursue our degrees there. They didn't change the name on us. We all knew what we were getting ourselves into.

> people think we are in the same pool as those who have taken one online course some random time period ago

Tell them otherwise. Prove them otherwise.

A prominent HLS alum was the first person who told me that I should consider HES for my bachelors degree over top residential colleges that I was admitted to. A distinguished alum of the college concurred with them upon my asking them for advice. It's not as though knowledgable people consider HES a joke - the people who do, in my experience, are not people I wish to academically or professionally impress regardless.

If you wanted a brand-name degree, perhaps HES wasn't the right choice for you. But, for what it is, it's aptly named.",25,Gzideck,3

One of the reasons the grad student union is threatening a strike is that the union is asking for HUHS to hire more mental health specialists or cover more off-campus providers, but so far Harvard has refused to negotiate on this at all...on the grounds that “If we improve[d] health care for graduate students in the bargaining unit, we would have to improve it for all students.” [source](http://harvardgradunion.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Status-of-Bargaining-October-2019.pdf)
