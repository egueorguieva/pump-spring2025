ptxa1h,hdz15he,Byu finally listened to their economics professors about rent control lol. Big win for students,132,michiganpatriot32,1
ptxa1h,hdz1sxi,RIP Redstone management and all the other property management companies that had a monopoly,119,sarlacc98,2
ptxa1h,hdz6ra0,"Interesting. I see a couple other noteworthy changes in here not being mentioned:

1. Institute no longer qualifies one to live in BYU housing. This means that neither UVU students nor recent graduates are allowed to live in BYU contracted off-campus housing.
2. BYU students with more than two semesters still *can* live in contracted off-campus housing, but the implication of ""limited space"" is that contractors are required to give preference to newer students.

I strongly suspect this will not affect rent prices as much as people here think it will. Yes, you now have more options, but Redstone, Aspen Ridge, Continental, and all the other property management companies still own most of the properties in the area. True, they won't have a captive market in the sense that students have to live in approved housing, but they also no longer have to follow off-campus housing regulations. Here are some things I would expect to see from the scummier management companies:

1. Expect to see rent stay about the same but with the addition of a monthly fee for apartment furnishings.
2. Crappy properties near the university (especially south of campus) that have previously been forced to provide some basic maintenance in order to keep their contracted housing status will probably get crappier.

Some other consequences I would expect to see in the immediate future:

1. Parking will become even more competitive. With more students choosing to live in Orem, Springville, and other parts of Provo to get cheaper rent, more students will have to commute to school. I'd find some carpool buddies or take advantage of the fact that your student ID doubles as a bus pass.
2. There will be a significant reshuffling of YSA stake and ward boundaries. With less contracted housing necessary, apartments will begin retooling themselves to offer spots to families, older single adults, and non-members. YSA wards near the university will stay much the same, but those a little further out will become somewhat more spread out (now it'll be a city block instead of a single apartment complex). Much further from the university, YSA wards will become more compact as students begin renting homes or apartments previously occupied by families and older adults.
3. There will be a very strong change in the culture for YSA wards. Contracted housing will comprise mostly of younger students, and off-campus, non-contracted housing will be mostly older students.",81,geekusprimus,3

It's heart rending to see BYU cast out individuals based on lost religious beliefs, *especially* because college is a time for personal and academic scrutiny.

rq8cz4,hqasnjq,"The same applies to professors.  I passed up other opportunities with greater pay, prestige, and access to research facilities and funding because as a devout member of the church I wanted to be a part of BYU.  After 18 years on the faculty, as a tenured professor in good standing in the university and in the church, getting some of the highest teaching evaluations in my college, having published papers and received external grant funding, and having just won the top annual teaching award in my college, I felt I could no longer pretend I believed in something that I had stopped believing years ago.  Although BYU does have non member faculty, it does not allow former members to work there under the same conditions as someone who had never been a member - even if you tow the line and support the LDS church in every way possible short of claiming to personally believe in it's teachings, and never ever mention your beliefs to anyone on or off campus.

I can tell you that I have worked to assist a former member who walked away from the church go through the process for rebaptism. That is not to say everyone that leaves will come back, but expelling someone after they decide the church is not for them will definitely guarantee they never will.

hr1ttn,fy1fla7,"Being a landlord doesn’t necessarily have to be dishonest, it’s a solid investment that many decent people make. The problem is Aspen Ridge Management and other property management companies in Provo that take advantage of students’ lack of familiarity with renters’ rights.

That or a lawyer needs to round up a bunch of students and bring a class action lawsuit on some of these places.",28,None,1
hr1ttn,fy1yh0z,"Renting in Provo sucked. I hated Aspen Ridge. They treated their tenants so poorly. My roommate got extra charges for cleaning they never did. They kept offering to reduce the fee, even though they never did the work. It took him months to get the charges taken off, and only after he worked with dispute resolution. 

Then I moved to Montana. I live in an apartment above my landlord (he owns the house and I rent the upstairs apartment). MAN! It’s such a world of difference. I will never go back, if I can avoid it, to a management company. Such a scam. This guy is chill as can be, rent and utilities are paid on Venmo (no screwy processing fees or “utility bill handling fees” jacking up your monthly cost). When your landlord knows you (and you know your landlord personally) the relationship is way better and there is trust. And you actually get rewarded for being a good tenant rather than being treated like a criminal in all cases and disputes.

The committee on race made, along with their other recommendations, a recommendation to review campus policies which may disproportionately affect people of different races. This plays into removing the beard rule for two reasons: 

1) pseudofolliculitis, the primary reason you can qualify for a beard card, primarily affects black people (upwards of 60% of black men according to a brief internet search), meaning they have to go through the painful process of getting a beard card at much higher rates (and they have to pay for it).

2) some races have thicker facial hair than others. I'm of Irish/English descent, and when I shave it takes around two days for my 5 o'clock shadow to really become noticeable due to my light hair color. On the other hand, I have friends of Italian/Middle Eastern descent who have super thick, coarse, dark facial hair. They would look like they haven't shaved for 3 days if they waxed their face. That means that they will get turned away from the Testing Center even if they shaved in the Testing Center bathroom. Disparate impact.",38,None,1

By going to BYU we consent to following the rules of the honor code, but we don’t consent to inappropriate questions regarding mistakes we have made. The honor code office should not have the power to pull your ecclesiastical endorsement after you’ve repented and your bishop says you are okay. The honor code office is encouraging students to not go through the process of repentance for fear of being expelled, which only promotes sin. How is it that we can work through issues with our bishop and be okay with the Lord, but the “Lord’s school” can say we didn’t repent enough and punish us for it? ",42,babsy18,1

kqrbwg,gi5hnn8,"So today the BYU bookstore, only one week before the start of the semester, is requiring every freshman to buy their textbooks exclusively from their store. The only way to opt out is to physically go IN PERSON and request a cancellation of charge, and it has to be done before the add/drop deadline or else you’re screwed. 

If you’re studying away from campus, there’s no way to escape this. 

Additionally, according to the [faq](https://www.byustore.com/student-first), this will continue every year starting with the freshman class so that by 2023 every BYU student will be forced into this program. 

I’m going to be contacting the bookstore and STRONGLY ask them to discontinue this. I plead with everyone who sees this to do the same. Start a petition, call, or write the administration.

And to all incoming freshman, the bookstore should be your last resort, not your first option. You can find textbooks online for only 20%-30% of the bookstore’s selling price most of the time. I can’t remember a time when I actually bought a book from the bookstore after my first semester at byu.

Edit: u/mspixton pointed out that the person to email is mark_clegg@byu.edu

jx8jc5,gcv0um4,"This is the review I left for omni apartments, which is owned by red stone:

NEVER LIVE HERE OR ANY REDSTONE MANAGED COMPLEX!!!! This review is as of 10/23/2020. The management is awful. Just in the last two months I’ve lived here I’ve never had as bad of an experience at an apartment than I have now. As of this morning, they booted at least 20 people’s cars after zero notice. No email or anything. I called and texted with no answer. Finally went by the office and they said they did “everything they could” to give us notice, which was nothing. Not even exaggerating.

Also, our toilet was broken when we got here and was constantly running, and pouring out water. Many, many attempts to reach the management both in person and virtually resulted in absolutely nothing. After a month of this, our bill was an extra $40 for just water. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!

Also don’t even try to contact them, I’ve tried email, text, phone call and in person, and have only seen them once. That was today lol.

***edit: I woke up early to get the boot off my car and it already got towed 🙃. What kind of management tows their own tenants (and a student at that) car after no notice?",27,averagesizechungus,1
jx8jc5,gcuyil6,"Oh, let me share a story about my time at the Rivera (2 years ago) who is ~~owned~~ *managed* by Redstone Residential. My thoughts at the time of the events are in italics.

My year-long contract there was hell. Don't get me wrong, I loved my roommates and the ward but the management was shady on a good day. Every month we had a cleaning check, whatever I usually had the kitchen to clean as my job. I scrubbed the hell out of that thing every month and I failed at least 6 of the 12 cleaning checks during the year. They looked for any reason to fail you. Funny thing is, they never told you what it was that you failed for. So when the recheck happens like a few days later, they would fail me again and charge me an extra $35 for a ""cleaning"" crew to come. I stuck around all day twice for the ""cleaning crew"" to come. Once it was the main office staff and they cleaned nothing, the second no one showed up. I could have sworn the checkers were paid per fail they gave to cleaning checks with how fail-happy they were.

My final month comes around and I ask the front office if I have to pay my last month's rent and they confidently say ""Yes!"". I wasn't sure if I paid last month's rent in the deposit or not so I asked them to check and they said, No you have to pay last month's rent. So I write the check and didn't think to make sure until a few days later when I checked the contract. I asked for the money back and of course, I had to jump through 1000 hoops to get my damn money back.

And after leaving my miserable experience didn't stop. You know that all-important deposit that complexes force out of you and tell you a certain amount is ""refundable""? Yeah, good luck prying that from their greedy hands when it's time to leave. Final check day came, I left the stupid addressed envelope, stamp, etc. that they ""need"" (otherwise they charge you $3 for it! lol).  About two months pass and I still haven't seen the refundable part of my deposit. So I call the Rivera. They tell me ""Oh, there was an issue with the printer here and YOURS didn't get printed"" (*wonder how many other people's checks ""didn't get printed""*). So they told me to wait a few days, I waited, no one called me back. So I called them, they said they still are having printer issues, (*yeah sure you are*). So they tell me to call/email Redstone about the issue. So I email Redstone Residential and get into a bit of an email battle with the secretary. I wrote her saying that I still hadn't gotten my refunded deposit back, oh, and that last month's rent I paid but I didn't need to. So after almost a week she finally tells me that she will get on it but that she will deduct $50 because I ""failed the final cleaning check"" (*oh WOW, you don't say! /s*). I finally convinced her to give me that damn $50 because they had already gotten $100+ from me during the freaking school year. Then the best part, she also tells me that they are having ""printer issues"" and that I need to come down to the main office to pick up my check. You would think that with the amount of money they took from me for cleaning checks they could fix their damn printers! (*Imagine if I lived outside of the Provo/Orem area during the summer...*) Finally got my money... after 3 months of lots of pestering them.

TLDR;

I was forced to pay a stupid amount of money for monthly cleaning checks that felt like a coin toss. Redstone Residential and other property management companies attempt to swindle any money they can out of the residents. When it came time to uphold their end of the contract and return my refundable portion of the deposit, they looked for any reason to not return the money or keep as much of it as possible.",20,Cholojuanito,2
jx8jc5,gcv8oz9,"The way I see it is this:

In the early 2010s when Redstone was founded they recognized the potential to essentially corner the housing market in Provo. Independent complex owners were getting older and looking to cash out and move on with their grandkids etc. They probably got some venture capital and started buying up complexes and houses as they went up for sale. 

What happened next was some pretty impressive growth. From what I could find, in 2013 they were managing 1,300 beds. Now in 2020 they are in the 20,000s. They look like the future of Provo housing, and in my opinion that future is going up--in the quite literal sense. Land is becoming more scarce, I bet that in the next couple years we will see a lot more homes and entire blocks bought out south of campus and big complexes built there.",15,butt-hole-eyes,3

pkmwqc,hc56b2z,"I used to supervise the team that repaired these. I know, feel free to burn me alive. I worked my tail off to try to change this about print and mail. A few things made this hard:

The supervisor of my supervisor was cheap. They didn’t buy us new printers often and had us (n00bz) repair old ones and try them out before getting new ones. And often the new ones came from BYU surplus used and we still had to repair them. 

There are 4 people on the team and they’re in charge of all tech support for the BYU Print and Mail building PLUS these printers PLUS most of the print service desks located on campus. It’s a hellish workload.

Printers literally suck as a technology. It’s a cliche in movies to have issues with thw office printer because they seriously just SUCK. 

BYU has a contract for harder repairs, troubleshooting, and maintenance to be done by a KonicaMinolta tech who has to travel through all of southern and central Utah. They won’t give us another tech because we don’t own enough printers or something (I can’t really remember why, it’s been five years). 

Rest assured though, that I tried so hard to fix these problems. I streamlined our ticketing system, made submitting student tickets possible, threw out a ton of old print stations nobody used to decrease our load, and vouched for putting brand new printers in. I spent a summer troubleshooting problems with those new printers and there were STILL issues with them once the semester started. Printers seriously SUCK and so do idiot students like me with only on the job training.

I still shake my fist when I go to print and end up wandering through three buildings to find one that works. Some of those printers are absolutely haunted.

We would also hike that same mountain and there would be grapes and plums we would pick and make home made jam from them.

I think the biggest problem lies in the fact that the HCO steps in on matters of *sin*, not just university misconduct. And without the calling and mantle that Bishops have, they mandate things that interfere with or overshadow some of the fundamental precepts of the gospel (the atonement/repentance process). 

I think it makes sense to leave the matters of eternal importance to Bishops (with keys and callings), let the police handle illegal matters (sexual assault, theft, drug abuse), and keep the more university policy stuff with the HCO (plagiarism, academic dishonesty, etc). Obviously committing a crime would call your standing at the university into question, but if Bishops truly are the judges in Israel, why is the HCO weighing in on matters of sin?",28,Krombopulous_Michele,1

qk3jtp,hiugwzy,"My advice is to spend some time pondering and praying about three things: your testimony of Christ, your testimony of the COJCOLDS, and your testimony of your Ward. When I was closer to your age, I was prone to feeling that if Jesus was real, then my home teachers ought to actually care about me, and that if my Sunday School teacher taught a good lesson that must mean the atonement is real. I don't believe either of those things. I'm all for giving people as much grace as possible, but sometimes your Ward just sucks. Sometimes people around you are idiots, and sometimes BYU culture makes you want to run away screaming. These things can make it a lot harder to be excited about church, but they're not worth ditching (or joining) a religion over.

As an ""old man"" (comparatively) I like to say that I actually believe fewer things than I used to, but I'm more firmly rooted to Christ. There have been times in life where I've just had to hunker down with that knowledge and wait until I was able to resolve some other things.

qk3jtp,hivsqnv,"The BYU survival guide ( https://byusurvivalguide.com/ ) is a useful resource for your situation. BYU does not supply any support or resources for students who lose their faith for any reason, so it can be isolating and difficult to keep going, especially when leaving isn't a realistic solution or when trauma is involved.

If you want to regain a testimony, whether in the church or outside it, I'd recommend spending time outside of church discovering what parts of your religious upbringing and beliefs you value, and what kind of person you want to be. 

If the church helps you to live those values and be that person, great! If not, that's great too! The church doesn't have a monopoly on spirituality or truth or goodness. It's okay to find what you need in other places, in other churches or inside yourself. It's not a betrayal of BYU or the church. After all, I figure God would rather you be a good person than just a good member.

And in the meantime, the survival guide has the most complete advice I've found on surviving at BYU during a faith crisis, a situation that requires limited church attendance, or as an ex member. I hope you find it useful.",24,Czarcasm2jjb,3
