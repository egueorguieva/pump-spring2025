City council said ""our PD does not have the resources to be the party patrol"" and makes it a 'recommendation' instead. 

Why did OSU invite thousands of students to live on (and off) campus? Money > health. Same as ever, they put the burden of solving hard problems on the City of Corvallis (housing comes to mind).

It's still a shit situation for the university though, for example they have cut the salary of every employee making above $50k (the rate of cutting increases with salary up to 12% at $222k) because they have a projected defecit of $50 million this year.

On the other side, the Corvallis economy would not be nearly what it is without the university (obviously). If no students came back, many businesses would need to close permanently (and might still from what I've been reading).

Not saying ANYTHING justifies OSU's piss poor response to the situation, just highlighting that it is a nuanced issue.

n3juzk,gwq8k5y,"From wikipedia, ""Edmund Creffield"".


""Edmund Creffield did not say anything outrageous when he first came to Corvallis in 1903, preaching mostly about ""the beauty of the full Gospel.""[5] Soon his followers believed he was receiving messages directly from God.[6] Creffield preached for hours on end and his followers loudly rolled on the floor pleading for God's forgiveness. When their cacophonous meetings began running into the early morning hours, Creffield was barred from holding services within city limits.[7]

During the summer he and his followers camped out on Kiger Island in the Willamette River. When the fall rains started Sarah Hurt and her three children, Maud, Frank, and Mae, some of his most ardent followers, invited him and about twenty others to move into their house just outside Corvallis. In October the group burned most of the house‚Äôs contents including furniture, utensils, heirlooms, a cat, and a dog.[8] Reports that a baby had been sacrificed were false.

People soon began to ask if Creffield could really ""live in the same locked house with a number of young girls, and do nothing in the world but be religious.""[9]

In January 1904, twenty vigilantes called the White Caps tarred and feathered Creffield, and told him to leave town and never come back. The next day Creffield and Maud Hurt were married in a room where ""the odor of [pine] tar was noticeable.""[10]

In February Creffield was accused of having adulterous relations in Portland with Maud‚Äôs aunt, Donna Starr. Adultery was a criminal offense, so a warrant was put out for his arrest. A statewide manhunt went on for months. Meanwhile, many of his followers fasted and spent their days lying flat on the floor praying.[11] Most were committed to either the Oregon State Insane Asylum or the Boys and Girls Aid Society in Portland.

In July, one month after Sarah Hurt was committed, Creffield was discovered nude and starving under her house. Creffield said he was innocent, but was found guilty and served seventeen months in the Oregon State Penitentiary. When released, he claimed he was Jesus Christ risen from the dead, his resurrection being his emergence from prison.[12]

Creffield said he was responsible for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and his followers, all of whom had been released from the asylum, believed him.[13] ""Creffield is Jesus Christ,"" Cora Hartley said. ""He condemned the city of San Francisco and brought the earthquake; he has condemned the city of Corvallis and an earthquake will destroy this place.""[14] She and the others obeyed his order to evacuate to the coast.

In April, Louis Hartley, a wealthy mine owner, followed his wife, Cora, and daughter, Sophie, when they went to Newport to meet up with Creffield and the others. As the group boarded a ferry, Hartley fired a revolver four times at Creffield. The gun snapped harmlessly because the centerfire cartridges were wrong for the rimfire gun.[15]

Others were also gunning for Creffield, so he fled to Seattle with Maud. There, George Mitchell, Esther's brother, found him and, in front of witnesses, killed him.[16]

Multnomah County‚Äôs district attorney, John Manning, sent King County‚Äôs prosecuting attorney, Kenneth Mackintosh, a letter saying, ""I investigated many, many charges against him [Creffield] while he was on his Holy Rolling tour in Oregon, the character of which were perfectly awful, in so far as being low, degenerate and brutal, and if permitted, I would like an opportunity to testify before the grand jury, before Mitchell is indicted ‚Ä¶ I think the taking of the law in one‚Äôs own hands, under such circumstances, to mete out summary justice is almost excusable."".[17] Mackintosh was appalled by Manning‚Äôs suggestion.

O.V. Hurt, Creffield's father-in-law, hired one of the best law firms in Seattle to defend George. Numerous witnesses testified to telling George that ""free love""[18] took place in 1903. They said they told George that Creffield preached that Christ would be reborn and one of the Brides‚Äô of Christ would be the new Mary and that he needed to lay his hands upon them and purify them.[19] They said they told George that mothers were debauched in front of their daughters, including Sarah and her then sixteen-year-old daughter, Mae.[20] They said they told George that finally Creffield announced that the new Mary was Esther Mitchell, the then sixteen-year-old sister of George.""[21]

Many believe that much of the testimony was perjury, a tactic to avoid hearsay and put Creffield on trial. George was found not guilty by reason of insanity and released. Two days later, Esther shot and killed him using a gun Maud bought using their witness fees.[22]

O.V. was devastated, but still loved his daughter so he hired the same lawyers who had defended George, to defend her.[23] Before the case went to trial, Maud committed suicide.[24] Esther was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to Western State Hospital, an asylum in Steilacoom, Washington.[25]

Esther was released from the asylum in 1909.[26] She committed suicide in 1914.""",14,None,1

It would be nice to see some tuition forgiveness, but the university can't really do much, they need to balance the books as well. Even if people aren't using the buildings, they still need to be paid for; mortgages, security, maintenance, ect. Health services are still running so that requires a fee.

With that being said, my recommendation is to talk specifically with the DAS office (the office that works with students to get accommodations) because they sometimes are able to have processes where the university/individual colleges have provided funds to be used to go towards the expensive testing. You could always try and see if that works.

Option B: Just try for a 2nd opinion from a healthcare provider (like a primary care physician) that takes your insurance and explain your situation from a psychological perspective and see if they can refer you for psych care with you doing some free tests online and showing them the results (someone else suggested this in this comments section). The psychologist might then be able to evaluate you for cheaper than $2000. Potentially. I don't know this from experience. Basically what I'm trying to explain is that the SHS ""network"" of healthcare providers is going to be more limited than other clinical practices that are out there. So if you go to a more extensive provider, they might be able to offer you more options.

> I would like you to get up.

*again, officers hold her as she gets up, and again, she protests being touched(however, she only calls out against the male, not the female officer)*

*again, asks to not be touched. Officer has to tell her that, since she is in custody, she won‚Äôt be waking on her own.*

To me, it seems like the main issue is the women both didn‚Äôt want to speak to the police(which is perfectly legal, but you can be detained for this. However, there is nothing wrong with someone enacting their right to be silent or following [STFU Friday](https://youtu.be/JTurSi0LhJs)) and also constantly spoke out about being detained. 

If she had answered the original questions, she *probably* wouldn‚Äôt have been detained(see the beginning of this comment for the quotes about why she was arrested). Maybe identifying herself somehow would have notified the police that she was dangerous or wanted, but I doubt it. Also, if she hadn‚Äôt attempted to stand up on her own and then explicitly stated she would ‚Äúrather lay down‚Äù, she would have been sitting normally on the curb, which would have been much more comfortable(emotionally, I don‚Äôt mean feel better sitting on a hard curb than laying in grass).
