ig124u,g2r82gb,"Uhggggggggggg I just want to go out with my friends on a Saturday night. Is that too much to ask? But every time I see a group like this I know that I’ve got to add an extra two weeks onto the amount of time it’s safe to go out and by this point it feels like that it’s never going to arrive. If we had just all sat down and waited during the summer we might have already been done with this, but because a bunch of short-term thinkers couldn’t handle the idea of not going to a rave for a single weekend or putting on a mask for a few minutes when they go out, we’re still stuck in this mess and it’s worse now than ever.

nijnbi,gz24i46,"This guy’s name is Michael, and he’s at 24th and Whitis Monday to Friday, 8:30 to 4:30. 

Before everything, I used to skate by his little lookout and stop at the stop signs because I was on the road. He noticed and gave me props for that, and words of encouragement from then on.

I stopped by a few times and had a few conversations with him after that. I could tell this guy was a kind soul with a lot of love to share, and hot damn was I right!

Since I graduated literally yesterday and I’ve already moved to a different city and state, I figured I’d take one last cruise around campus, and I ran into this beautiful soul!

Michael and I caught up, he said he was very proud of me and that I’m eventually gonna get married. When that happens, he wants an invite, and he’s the first person on the list! He prayed over me, which isn’t my wave, but I still feel the love there, and I can’t say enough good things about Michael. He’s got a heart of gold, and he deserves the world ❤️

If you go by this intersection on a regular basis as classes start back up, or even if you don’t, please make some time to drop by and have a chat with Michael. It’ll brighten your day and he loves when people do that! Tell him Wes sent ya ;)",385,AllThotsAllowed,1

I didn’t think much of it until yesterday, when a man came up to me in the Union with the exact same schtick. 

In hindsight, I’m kind of glad I venmoed that girl. I googled her Venmo handle and she has some personal accounts on other websites with the same username. Maybe I could reach out and see if she’d be willing to tell me what’s going on?

edit: alright, this is weird. Their display name on Venmo is “Princess Laranas.” If you Google that, the first result is an Austin-based “news personality” that works for SMNI USA, a Filipino televangelist network.

We heard him meowing in his lair the night after the worst freeze, so we knew he survived the coldest night -- but we hadn't seen any sign of him since then.

All of the other cats emerged in the nice weather, but still no Domino. We were starting to get pretty worried about him...

qbfo4p,hhap034,"Prof here.  I write a lot of rec letters, but I also say no to students I don't know.  In large lecture classes I may never have even seen you, so you are basically a stranger about whom I know a few test grades.  That is fine in the academic setting, but I have no grounds to recommend you.  I could write something like ""he got a B- in my class,"" but that is not enough for a rec letter.  

Let this be a warning to other folks reading this - go to office hours, ask questions, form relationships.  Sure office hours are weird and intimidating and all that.  Buck up.  Make yourself go, make yourself talk, if you got nothing to say and no one else is talking there is always the great standby question of ""what is your research about?""  Most profs love talking about their research and they'll remember that you showed an interest.  Then stay in touch if you think you are going to need a rec letter one day.  Profs love to hear from past students, so just send an email once a semester saying hi and what you've been up to.  You'll get awesome rec letters and it won't even be that awkward to ask.",63,pW9pqAwE87,2

ijzx5v,g3hh2o6,"Just to give context because everyone seems to really not understand how prevalent the virus is. In the United States we're at 6,183,934 cases,  187,374 deaths. With an estimate of  328,000,000 people in the United States:  
 \- 1 in every 53 people in the US have or have had it.  
 \- 1 in every 1,750 people in the US have died from it.

These students in almost all likelihood already had the virus and came to school and are now just figuring out they had it. Again, 1 in 53 people. UT and the US have just not bothered on testing people. There are likely hundreds of people at UT right now that have it. These numbers are simply from people who have been tested, students/young adults are not able to afford/aren't scared enough to get tested.

I do think it’ll be hard to follow through on, but I want to support our players on all their asks, and not be selective of what I believe to be racist and what isn’t, since I can’t ever have the same perspective black people do

Oh man, most of this is perfectly fine but they're gonna have a hard time with the Eyes.  I personally didn't know about its origins but that's gonna be a tough one for people to swallow, especially since most of the people singing it probably don't associate it with racism at all (myself included).

UT especially was touted as what was supposed to be the time of our lives, at least by my uncle who graduated in '05, but a lot has changed since then

I hated going to class, I hated waking up every day. I felt an intense visceral loathing for everyone- all the rich kids who went to fancy high schools, etc. (I know that's not everyone, but I was just jealous and bitter).  It was so overwhelming.

 I had some sort of nervous breakdown before midterms every single month due to acute stress, was hospitalized, yada yada. But before the downward spiral into depression and suicide attempts was your line of thinking- the hate. If you are able to, as cliche as it is, I would seek some help.

A lot of times degrees are just a checkbox off of a resume for employers but are not always dealbreakers. Even after graduating you often need to start at the bottom and work your way up anyways. Speaking from experience and dealing with my own issues mentally i spent too long retaking classes and getting q drops before realizing it was not the right time for me to be in school. I spent too long realizing that and it’s better to go into college with a certain level of drive for what you want to get out of it. Cause when it sucks, it sucks! I’m in a different place in my life and hope to go back soon to finish my degree for my own reasons and with a fresh perspective instead of being burnt out as fuck with the education system.

Edit: want to take this time to shout out UHS. It took me entirely too long to seek out help for my depression/mental health. Luckily I had a group of amazing professors that genuinely cared for my mental health and were able to encourage/help me get set up. if you’re reading this and might need it, take advantage of the extensive (and cheap) resources UT has to offer while you can.

We tried catching him and trapping him numerous times to take him to the vet, but he is too damn stubborn to be caught. We tried grabbing him, we tried a drop trap, we even tried sardines! 

I had a stakeout one night trying to trap him, and I got UTPD called on me for looking sketchy.

Despite not being able to take him to the vet, we tried to get antibiotic on his wound at least once or twice a day. We were successful on most days, although he did start getting mad at us.

We don't know what happened, probably got in a fight with a tomcat or possibly raccoon. [I took him to the vet 2 years ago](https://www.facebook.com/catsofwestcampus/posts/2150956778291654) so thankfully his rabies vaccine was still up-to-date.
