1c0wiln,kyze5d1,"As a Black alum, I‚Äôd say Williamstown as a town is not the most diverse, and it won‚Äôt offer much Black community outside of the college. But luckily, nearly every Williams student‚Äôs life revolves entirely around campus, which is diverse and does have several clubs and affinity spaces (including an affinity house) for Black students specifically. A small (white) town experience where you make deep connections with tons of other diverse interesting Black students (and other students) is not the Black college experience that everyone is looking for, but I‚Äôve seen it be pretty amazing. 

I‚Äôm not at all one of those alums who is pro-Williams in all regards. But it is my personal opinion that an intentionally approached Williams experience would likely be a great deal richer of an experience than your other option, especially considering the academic culture, flexibility and community at Williams (including with Black professors), which all truly changed my life. Congratulations on some awesome opportunities. You‚Äôre going to do amazing either way.",33,habitremedy,1
1c0wiln,kyzbzlz,Williams will be an infinitely better undergrad experience with unparalleled law school placement. Don‚Äôt worry about racism - the school itself is very safe and williamstown is so small that nobody really cares about what the students look like,19,0xCUBE,2
1c0wiln,kz3uw2y,"I am not a williams alumni or Austin Alumni. This just showed up my feed and I have no idea why. I am however someone that did a Ph.D in a business school and know how these schools are respected among business school. I am also POC that grew up in Alabama, and understand what  you mean.

I've learned from living in many places in the South (Atlanta/Nola/CHarlotte/Birmingham), that southern cities are always southern. Even the liberal parts. I think it would do you good to see another region than texas.

Wiliams is also a order of magnitude higher as an undergraduate institution that UT Austin. UT Austin is a good public school. Williams is an Elite institution. If your applying to graduate schools its treated like doing an undergraduate at the top end of the Ivy League schools. You can get a good opportunities at either school, and both schools can open doors, however the thing is Williams  SHOWS you doors that UT Austin won't.

Your also 18. What you want to do now, might not be what you end up wanting to do. At 18, I thought I wanted to be a clinical psychologist or a philsopher and was aiming for Ph.D in those fields, I ended up doing a Ph.D in Financial Economics instead.

Now to answer your question: I am 100 percent certain that Austin has sent their best students to all of the top MBA and Law Schools. If your grades are good, and test scores are good, you'll be fine. Austin has top 20 departments  in Economics and Business and Politics.  However, from P.O.V admissions, Williams on a resume is closer to going to Harvard than it is Austin. People legitimately turn down Harvard to go to Williams and they aren't crazy.

The other thing is you are getting two vastly different education. Austin is a big state school. Williams is a top LAC with small classes and individualized attention and resources per student. Things Austin can't and won't provide. Austin probably has a wider range of paths and more flexibility, because it is a large university, but not all paths are good. I would bet money that median Williams grad is doing better in like 20 years later than the median austin grad. Both are probably doing just fine.",14,None,3
1bqddjn,kx1xfei,"I went to Williams and then to UofC for grad school. I was a TA for freshman chemistry, so I interacted with UofC undergrads regularly. Both are great schools, but boy the UofC students were a lot more stressed and depressed than Williams students! 

Plus: Grad students were in charge of teaching chemistry labs and grading the exams. At Williams, the professors taught the labs and did their own grading. And this was not just in chemistry. Grad students teaching undergrads is typical in larger schools like UofC.",27,MiniLaura,1
1bqddjn,kx28hhx,"I chose between Uchicago and Williams twice, as a frosh and after a gap year between sophomore,ore and junior year‚Ä¶ and chose Williams twice. For me it came down to 1) small class sizes across subjects, as given my background, I felt I would do better in smaller environments that forced interaction; and 2) student body - UC almost bragged about how unhappy/stressed their students were (shirts with tag line ‚Äúwhere fun goes to die‚Äù). Life is serious, and you enter college a kid. I felt put off by that almost carelessness around mental health. This was twenty years ago, but as someone living in Chicago, think it still holds true. 

Reality is both are tremendous schools. Choose the spot based on where you think YOU will thrive as a whole person - academically, socially, etc. 

Good luck!",13,cvielma1,2

1bzpg0g,kyrdusy,"Chose Williams over Ivies because I wanted small classes and close mentorship from faculty. I didn't want to be taught by grad students more focused on where they'll be next than on where they are, and I didn't want to have to ""compete"" with grad students for research opportunities. Williams also fosters a sense of community that I haven't seen anywhere else come close to, liberal arts college or otherwise. Williams changes lives, plain and simple.

I'm currently in grad school at an Ivy. For what's important to my education, I'm simultaneously glad to be here for grad school and glad to have been at a small liberal arts college for undergrad. Where I'm from in the South, no one has heard of Williams. That doesn't matter. Employers and grad schools know and deeply respect the Williams experience.",33,monkey-with-a-typewr,1

1bzpg0g,kyvuvy9,"Depends on what you're looking for. If you want a brand name, go to a brand name school, if  you want the cozy and personal experience, go to a cozy personal school. I did Williams for undergrad and  a brand name school for grad school. 

I found the brand name university experience overstimulating and was surprised by many students' lack of ability. Bureaucracy in the university setting was also very dehumanizing (for me). On the other hand I know people who wanted to attend  big sports schools, and to be in relationships with TAs rather than professors (because maybe TAs are less intimidating? ). Those people enjoyed the brand name schools.

In retrospect the access to great minds at Williams is unparalleled. Now at the graduate level I still rarely get access to professors. When we DO talk they're so surprised that I had interacted with their colleagues as an undergrad. 

Like I said its about what you want. 
What ever you do though, make sure it's a personal decision about what you want in life, not based on societal (or even parental) expectations.

Also, quick note: I'm not sure what list you're looking at , but Williams is typically considered a ""T20"" school by many standards--in fact often T10, and always T1 by US News report.So I answered based on what I think you meant.",5,lightwisher,3

I will say Williams takes the cake on this one by every conceivable metric.

Our phil program regularly sends kids to Oxbridge masters then goated phds after

Our endowment is an order of magnitude larger per student

In fact I'd argue that your just better off going to many state schools over Wesleyan, especially ones with good economics departments. Its a bad ROI all around.

1bmzbcg,kweyvxs,"Williams is very comparable if not outright better than some ivies. However, the two have different goals that creates the distinction between liberal arts college and research university. Do you want a big urban college experience and want to pursue engineering? Probably don't go to Williams. Do you want smaller, more intimate settings and a chance to work/know faculty well? Go to Williams. Many of my intro STEM classes frequently have less than 30 people, no chance you would ever get that kind of classroom experience at a large ivy.

As for academic rigor, Williams is a pretty work-intensive school since our semesters are only 12 weeks long. In general, course content is almost identical regardless of what institution you attend, but undergraduate teaching at an LAC like Williams is a top priority, so you may end up having a much better time at learning. Still, this school is pretty hard depending on what you major in. If you are thinking of pursuing law, be ready to read a lot. Between philosophy, political science, and other social science courses, expect to read (or more realistically, skim) a few hundred pages before class seminars.

Opportunities at this school are amazing. Whether it's getting an internship or conducting research, you almost have to try to not end up with very good experience by the time you graduate. The alumni network provides amazing connections regardless of what you want to do, and for placements into professional/graduate programs, Williams is easily up there since you are just given so much individual attention that you wouldn't otherwise get at a larger university.",28,ykxz,1

1ds60rk,lb0do9b,"Hey! I‚Äôll be a freshman at Williams this fall looking to major in Anthro/Humanities. I was the first applicant and accepted student from my school, too! Williams was definitely off the map for me, even though I‚Äôm from MA (closer to Boston). When I got in, I was actually honestly chill about it, but when I did research and visited, I became super excited‚Äî so I‚Äôm glad you have seen the sparkle of Williams so early! 

Personally, my ECs weren‚Äôt anything extraordinary‚Äî President of a major club, VP of another, Co-Pres of a minor club, and a part time job for five years. I finished second in my class of 550 with 11 APs. I‚Äôm not a STEM kid, I didn‚Äôt have any cool awards, but I did what I could. 

With that all being said, I truly think one of my biggest strengths as an applicant was the writing supplement. If you aren‚Äôt familiar, Williams has you submit a 3-5 page paper on any subject you want. It‚Äôs unique because it‚Äôs not a traditional college writing supplement (like the ‚ÄúWhy *This College*?‚Äù ‚Äî Williams doesn‚Äôt do those)! I recycled an argumentative paper about Hostile Architecture I wrote in AP Lang my junior year. I was passionate on the subject, it was well written, and I was happy with it. And now I‚Äôm on the road to Williamstown in August! 

My biggest piece of advice is to not let the fact that no one from your school has ever done it before hold you back. If I didn‚Äôt apply to Williams semi-randomly, my life right now would be really different. It seems like you‚Äôre on the right path now, so just believe in yourself and don‚Äôt give up. You got this!",6,stargirl_s,1
1ds60rk,lb1mm68,"Incoming freshman here! Just to touch on what you said about no one from your school having been accepted to Williams previously, don‚Äôt fret! Similar to the other commenter, a significant number of students at my school have applied to Williams in the past but I‚Äôm the first from my entire district to be accepted. I don‚Äôt know of any alumni from my region either‚ÄîI emailed the admissions office about it and even they were struggling to find anyone (still waiting to see if they have actually found someone). Somewhat interestingly, my school sends people to T20s each year (usually 1-3 people get accepted for ivies), which made me surprised to learn that no one had had a successful application before me.

With that said, focus on things that matter to you! For me, I had two-three standout ECs (a niche sport that isn‚Äôt recruited anywhere, language stuff, and debate). Academically, I was top of my high school in science and Spanish, as well as debate extracurricularly (I was a waitlist admit, so I feel somewhat confident in saying that these updates were impactful; I had actual awards in all three on the school and local level). I had high coursework rigor, good test scores, and a near-perfect unweighted GPA as well.

Make sure you submit the supplemental paper if they do it again during your application cycle‚Äîwith no actual supplements, every part of your application counts. I do think that Williams cares more about building a community of individuals rather than academic weapons or student body presidents, so don‚Äôt be afraid to take a risk and show them who you are, unapologetically.",3,Solivont,2
1ds60rk,lb8lwza,"Stellar grades and the heaviest possible course load have the most impact. It helps to craft a narrative about who you are not only in your essay but also everywhere else in your application‚ÄîECs, letters, classes, awards, and the supplemental essay. A unique personality that is consistently and holistically shown will be the second most important factor. Being at a prestigious school with a good track record definitely holds some weight, but not enough to be the end-all-be-all, so don‚Äôt worry about this too much; you can‚Äôt change it anyways. Good luck.",3,hth1hth1,3
mpq281,gubpxav,"I think the fact that you are self-aware of this participation issue makes you a perfect fit for Williams -- one thing that I wish I could tell my freshman self is that everyone at Williams, regardless of whether they went to Exeter or an underfunded public school, still has a lot to learn and just because someone was educated with the Harkness method doesn't mean they have anything more substantive to say than a student who didn't come from a prep school background. Most students are in a similar position as you, and they are all more self-conscious about how they sound in a discussion setting than they really should be. You'll find most people are too focused on themselves to judge you on what you said in class. 

And to your point about ""not being super smart"" -- I obviously don't know you personally, but if you're smart enough to get into Williams, you're smart enough to excel at Williams. What's much more important at this point is whether you're willing to work hard to make that happen.

- classes are demanding and stressful

- very much a liberal echo chamber, which causes discussions in humanities classes to go in circles with students repeating the same buzzwords and talking points, with no-one willing to actually share a meaningful take

- many students are from wealthy backgrounds and are incomprehensibly out of touch with life

oelpbx,h476fvu,"Not a current student, but I was accepted and Williams was one of my top choices.

Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think that there are really any objective ‚Äúcons‚Äù to Williams. Rather, you have to look at aspects such as class size, environment, teaching style, etc. to determine whether or not it fits you.

In terms of academics, for example, Williams is geared towards one-on-one teaching with tutorials and small class sizes. Its quality of education is top-notch, but this style will not suit everyone. Williams is also located in a more rural area with a small population, albeit with beautiful surroundings for nature lovers.

Ultimately, I chose a school with a larger class size and a more active city because I prefer that environment (this was my biggest factor), but it varies for everyone. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs really up to you. It sounds like you might prefer the rural environment, which is a really good sign that Williams may be perfect for you. Hope that helps!

Regarding your gender identity, I wouldn‚Äôt have any concerns about that here. The queer community is very strong on campus, and those who wouldn‚Äôt respect your identity are generally quite easy to stay away from (despite how small the college is, everyone has there own circles and spaces). Some of the admin (the president, most notably) are transphobic, but you won‚Äôt be interacting with them frequently if at all (also, all bathrooms on campus are gender neutral; the transphobic opinions exist but aren‚Äôt really ‚Äúfelt‚Äù on campus if that makes any sense).

For one, there is almost certainly a group for every niche/hobby/affinity, and especially with queer presence you'll have no problem finding it (QSU, BtB, QC, etc.) In fact, many queer groups will host social events and parties meant for (although not exclusively for) queer students. As a transfer, there's also resources that will be provided to you so that you find your transition to campus smooth and you get to meet other people. Profs. are very understanding and kind, and in the classroom and beyond it's very normal to introduce yourself with pronouns (optionally, ofc). As another commenter mentioned, first floor bathrooms tend to be gender neutral, whereas bathrooms in second floor/beyond are separate (for the most part, there are some exceptions).

1bu30yd,ky431ij,"Current student, not athlete, international, Div 1 major. I am very happy. As much as I bitch about the work and isolation and yadi yada, I love Williams. Was accepted to several big and prestigious schools and visited almost all Ivies---I must say, Williams is better than everywhere \*for me\* except maybe Princeton.

30 percent of students will die on a hill for Willy, and so will I. 50-60 percent is like meh, like Williams okay but not super passionate. 10-20% truly suffer and hate it, which makes me roll my eyes a bit cuz they often overlook key advantages of the college and complain about things that they should have known when they made their decisions. Don't wanna discredit people who have bad experiences as Willy can do tons of work to be better, but some people are delusional to think they'd be better off at another institution comparable in prestige and quality---the issues described by another commenter here exist ubiquitously and to far greater degrees at peer colleges from what I've seen.

You'll love Williams if you are appreciative of nature (I don't even hike, never did Mountain Day lol, but you absolutely must appreciate the air, the stars, the moon, the snow, etc.); you don't mind being in the antithesis of a city (I do mind this a fair bit ngl, but willing to trade off); love academics, and I do mean love, because it is intense af, more so than many Ivies (have many friends all over, we discussed workload copiously before); don't mind a small student body (this has a host of pros and cons).

It‚Äôs easy to get bogged down in the busy-ness  of academic life ‚Äî that‚Äôs true at any college ‚Äî but climbing a mountain after having finished a paper and looking down over the campus is the best feeling in the world and always gives me perspective  makes me incredibly happy.

y224fv,itebprv,"You won‚Äôt hear this from students necessarily, so an alumni offering this here.  The best part about Williams is the people you are with on campus.  It should say a lot that Williams is rainy and cold for much of the school year, and graduates are all still so positive about their time on campus.  The school facilities are great and all, but you will carry the friendships you make with you at Williams throughout the rest of your life in a meaningful way.  These friendships will be with students, professors, and even random maintenance staff.  

The second best thing is the alumni.  As long as you learn to reach out to alumni in a thoughtful way, which really just means writing a polite email making a clear ask, the alumni almost always respond to emails and frequently offer phone calls or give you access to some part of their networks.  You should reach out to alumni from day one, because it shows initiative, and frankly from an alumni perspective a freshman is not much different from a senior in terms of the level of conversation that will be had.

Also, be aware, the alumni network IS the career center.  I also recommend aiming for people who have been graduated for 5-20 years.  Much beyond 20 years their information may be out of date.  Much before 5 years, they may not be in a position to directly influence decisions around your ask, and much after 20 years, they will be pre-occupied with their families, careers, or potentially getting their own children into college.",4,Watercress-Friendly,3

tirkct,i1hdxpq,"1. Tutorials are just a different format of learning environment. Two students with a professor. Onr person writes a longer paper on that week's topic, the other writes a paper in response, and the class time is spent discussing the points. In my opinion, we really don't have that many at Williams, so people who love them can try to load up on them but many students go by without taking one. I took one elective tutorial class and did feel it sharpened my writing skills, since you have to churn out papers quickly for every class. 

2. We don't have frats and sororities, though some of the sports and other extracurricular groups pretty much mimic that kind of social group. There's a pretty wide range of social activities for such a small campus. You are probably going to find places to fit into. 

3. Williamstown is very rural for sure. That said, the college and town does try hard to mimic some urban conveniences. I personally lived in cities/big suburbs all my life, so having those 4 years of rural life was a big plus for me. Restaurants might be the part you miss the most. Dining services try, but they are not restaurants, and the area has few decent options for eating out but not many. 

4. I can't think of a better place to try out both if you are undecided. A ton of people double-majored, partly because our major requirements are not very heavy. They have pre-professional programs for both medicine and law. You do have to put in the work and be proactive, but lots of opportunities for internships and experienced in either field are available. 

5. This is my personal opinion based on having gone to many different types of colleges in this country, but Williams and most colleges/universities in this country  suffer from grade inflation. I'm absolutely not saying it's a cakewalk through every single class, but if you put in the work, study, and do your assignments, you will get at least the grade you deserve. Most times, you will be saved from a failing grade if you're willing to show effort, even if the product of your work is not good. The caliber of the education, the quality of instruction and content, is definitely high compared to the average college in this country, but it doesn't mean you will suddenly fail every single class because you're not from a fancy prep school. It was not easy going from coasting at my shitty public high school to being so confused in entry-level classes because it was clear most of my peers were exposed to actual college-level education prior to coming here. But my professors and TAs really worked with me and gave me so many opportunities even when my results deserved a failing grade. I've attended institutions where the instruction quality was so poor but if you don't make the certain number grade on a poorly-written test one time, you were given no room to improve yourself. 

6. It's really variable. I do think that for POC, it is a much harder issue to deal with on campus because the school has a hard time securing and keeping mental health professionals and resources that can help students of color, specifically. That said, there are resources and help available on campus. It's also good to acknowledge that while some people have only great time at Williams, some don't find it so great here. I had classmates who transferred out because they weren't happy here, and I still keep in touch with some of them. I wasn't a super Williams-pride student, yet here I am spending time to answer your questions because I'm excited for you. Some people are really all about school spirit, even long after graduating.",5,purofound_leadah,2

Mountain Day. Classes cancelled on a surprise Friday in October so that everyone can go hike up a mountain.

Once a semester, each student gets to invite a favorite professor to a special dinner. Apart from that, professors often dine/ spend time with students, and professors may invite their classes to their homes for dinner.

Freshman entry system and Ephventures orientation system ensure you meet people quickly as a freshman. ‚ÄúSnacks‚Äù is a formal Sunday night tradition bringing the entry together once a week, but entries do a whole lot of other stuff together during the year. The Ephventures orientation program is really fun, whether you are doing something like ‚ÄúWhere Am I‚Äù when you explore what‚Äôs available in the beautiful area from world-class art museums to local stores to short drives or walks to lovely waterfalls and viewpoints, or you are doing something more intense like a few nights‚Äô backpacking trip in the mountains (you choose your type of orientation program).

Opportunities based on the school‚Äôs endless resources and its loyal alumni: alumni-funding for any unpaid internship you get, alumni network, funding for whatever your club/organization wants to do, funding for research/ travel aboard/ etc., financial aid covers all your textbooks plus weird incidentals like skiing and snowboarding equipment rentals for PE classes and a suit for job interviews.

1bu318i,ky1zytu,"Generally fairly stressed academically, but I never met anyone at Williams that didn‚Äôt have a social support system (you could argue that‚Äôs kind of survivorship bias in who I talked to but anyways). Williams does a lot to set you up with community and I think people don‚Äôt realize how special and needed community is, not just in college, but in your life as a human being.

Of the people who were not happy (and by not happy I mean overall: academics stress out most students here unless you are exceptionally disciplined or intelligent, but I dont consider being stressed over schoolwork ‚Äúunhappy‚Äù unless its truly chronic and everpresent), you can almost always sort them into one of these categories.
1. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing to do in Williamstown! Party scene is so lame!‚Äù While these people aren‚Äôt wrong, if that‚Äôs what you wanted from college, I don‚Äôt know why you went here. I loved walking around on my own or with friends and hanging out in dorm rooms, so I was super happy. I think these people maybe didn‚Äôt know what they signed up for well enough, but maybe I‚Äôm being harsh. 
2. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt feel productive unless I‚Äôm constantly stressed out beyond all belief, so I will sign up for 20 things along with academics and want to cry 24/7!!‚Äù Ironically, the same behavior that got many students to a great school like Williams is the same reason that they will fail to be content while at Williams. Please be kind to yourself and know it is okay to have free time, to have rest time, to not always being pushing your limits. I promise that it won‚Äôt suddenly go away unless you put effort in to fix this mindset. 
3. Mental health issues. Self explanatory.
4. Severe social issues/problems. Some people get into drama (sometimes their fault, sometimes not) and because this school is small, it can materially impact how you socialize and/or where you can hang out for recharging. I have been a part of this group and it has sometimes been my fault and sometimes not. You can work through this if you are willing to humble yourself and let things go. There are more important things in life. 

Overall, people are very happy here. There‚Äôs a reason 30% of Williams alumni are married to each other and why alumni engagement/donations are high. I was super happy here. Almost all of my friends were as well and miss being there sometimes. You will have high highs and low lows. You can decide if that‚Äôs for you or not",9,Maglor125,1
wo0by6,ik8qq6g,"If you are a well qualified candidate and Williams is a top choice and somewhere you would love to go, then early decision will give you an advantage. Reasons it might be a top choice for you might include its top professors and students with small discussion-oriented classes (including the incredible tutorials with only two students and a prof), its gorgeous mountain setting, its freshman entry system that helps you get to know other students quickly upon your arrival, its amazing career and grad school outcomes, its wonderful intellectual atmosphere in which to explore ideas and become a strong writer and thinker, and its strong financial aid program.

Don‚Äôt apply if you are uncertain if you like its size and its rural location, or if being in a place with great food and immaculately kept dorms is important to you. Williams puts its money instead into the educational quality, extracurricular supports and special opportunities for students, and financial aid.

If you want to compare aid packages and might be happy to get merit aid somewhere else, then applying early closes that door, so don‚Äôt do it. BUT, Williams is the most generous school in the nation right now with its new no-loans all-grant meets-full-need need-based aid program with need-blind admissions for domestic students. So use the net price calculator on their website to see if the estimated family contribution makes the price tag seem manageable to your family. If it does not, don‚Äôt apply early. If it does, go for it!

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how the optional SAT thing is changing admissions at top colleges. Now, with a glut of students with 4.0s applying and fewer SAT scores to distinguish them, it seems much harder to be admitted absent another ‚Äúpull.‚Äù Perhaps early decision may be the boost that could help distinguish you.

If you do apply early decision to Williams, I recommend applying somewhere else that you like that is easier to get into that has nonbinding early action at the same time. Then, if you are rejected or deferred from Williams, it won‚Äôt be as devastating because you will know are ‚Äúin‚Äù somewhere else and will be going to college!

o8z6g2,h44xvvy,"Hi! I'm excited to hear that you're considering applying here! There's a lot to say about Williams, and I've only been here during the pandemic, so my time here isn't representative of the standard Williams experience. However, I'll share what I feel about the school!

Life at Williams has been great personally. There are a lot of reasons for this, but I guess it boils down to the people and the size of the school. Almost everyone I've met at Williams is tremendously friendly and is interesting to talk to. Unlike my high school, I haven't really felt the vibes of ""cliques"". There are obviously friend groups but I feel like they're a lot less pronounced at Williams. You meet people through different contexts all the time and a lot of people have friends who are involved in different activities, academics, etc. The entry system is a great conduit for this as well. Basically, around 30-40 of frosh live together and have activities like Sunday snacks (which is food + an activity) at a minimum or other things like dinners, dances, movie nights, etc. Some people don't like their entry, which is unfortunate but valid. There are other ways to make friends too, like through a club or classes. 

On top of your standard array of sports options and extracurricular interests, there are a lot of cultural and minority groups on campus as well, which help foster a sense of community and belonging. Because Williams is relatively small, you often see your friends or acquaintances walking around campus. It's kinda nice to just go out for a meal and end up catching up with someone you haven't seen in a while or just waving at people. Another thing I'm starting to find funny is how many friends you make that you end up being mutual friends with another one of your friends.

Classes have also been great! At least for me so far, all my profs have been super friendly and welcoming. You can tell they want to teach you and that they genuinely care. Divisional requirements might be annoying sometimes, but I do appreciate them for incentivizing me to branch out. People are pretty studious because classes at Williams do take time and can be intense! There are a lot of cute study spots on campus (having said that I'm usually too lazy to go to them lol). People do have fun though and there tends to be a decent amount of parties on weekends. I'm not much of a partier myself, but I found a group that I just hang out w/ when people tend to party/get drunk.

The food is meh. It's not bad by any means (I like it) but a lot of people have mixed feelings about it. Could be hit/miss but the dining staff does seem really nice and open to feedback and improving themselves. There's one street on campus that has a few shops and restaurants, which is kinda cute. The most popular shops include a Thai/Japanese restaurant, Indian restaurant, pizza place, and a market/cafe. 

In my first two months on campus I used to joke there's a scenic view everywhere I looked, especially during fall. There's a lot of accessible hiking trails and campus is very pretty. The downside to being rural though is that cities are a decent distance away. Boston and NYC are around 3+ hours away and can be cumbersome to travel to. There are free buses to North Adams (the nearest city) but it is still pretty rural as a whole. I never found this too much of an issue for me because I felt like for the most part, I was kept busy between classes, extracurriculars, and friends. 

Some Williams specific traditions are Mountain Day and Winter Study. Mountain day happens on a random Friday in October where the weather is good. Classes are cancelled and there are hikes of various intensities all day. It's a pretty fun time! Winter Study takes place during January. Basically we take 1 class (can be serious or for fun) and just spend time with friends on campus. 

I've kinda been rambling but I'm happy to elaborate/answer any specific questions you may have lol

mjz30g,gtghdll,"I was in this position, and I chose Williams for a few reasons. I skimmed through the answers to your post in the Pomona subreddit, so I'll try to respond to those as well. Disclaimer: they're both great schools, so the choice is likely going to depend more on your own preferences and situation than on qualities of either school.

1. The tutorial system, as well as WEPO (one of the only study abroad programs at Oxford that grants you equal status to a student there), are pretty awesome. I've taken a ton of tutorials at Williams thus far, and it's definitely been one of the defining and most positive aspects of my education here, if not *the*. That being said, not everyone finds tutorials attractive; I happened to, so that was a strong push toward Williams.
2. Williams *is* cold and isolated, but weirdly enough, I wanted that. I come from the west coast, and I was looking to explore a new part of the country. I also love nature, so being surrounded by trees and trails rather than suburbia was ideal for me. The weather isn't great, but it was fun for me to see snow for the first time (admittedly, I've gotten tired of it since...). I also was looking for a really beautiful campus, and I found that more in Williams than in Pomona.
3. My financial aid packet at Williams was slightly better than at Pomona.
4. Personally, I wasn't all that excited by the Claremont Consortium. My majors were best suited for classes at Pomona, so I didn't envision myself wanting to attend classes at other schools. (This is also why I didn't find myself very attracted to Amherst and its consortium). If anything, I was slightly worried that I'd have to face more competition to get into Pomona classes -- but I have no idea if this is true or not.
5. It's true that Williams has a large student athlete body. But if you're not into sports -- like me -- don't worry, since literally no one cares. Especially not recently.
6. I'd imagine that Williams and Pomona are nearly identical in terms of how intellectual its students are. So that probably won't be your deciding factor.
7. One person in the Pomona subreddit cited Pomona's career center in favor of it. I can't speak to the difference between Pomona and Williams here, but I can say that Williams also has a program that pays students for otherwise unpaid internships, and that the alumni network at Williams is super active (it's apparently the oldest in the world -- why, I don't know). Also, the most common employer of Williams students, last I checked, was Google -- take that as you will...
8. Some things I'll concede about Williams: not great diversity (though it looks like we're moving in a better direction, with identity-based housing slotted to come next semester), no easy access to big cities (Boston and New York are both 3-4 hours away, although Williams provides somewhat subsidized travel there on weekends), and not great weather.

szjv8u,hzzudo3,"I graduated Class of '21. The food at Williams is overall, very good. Granted, there are a few weak spots. For one, I know it can be difficult to get food variety if you have a very serious food allergy (someone I know has a very serious  gluten allergy and has had trouble getting food that isn't contaminated). The food quality also decreased during the Covid year(s), which for me was my senior year, but from what I've heard from my friends still on campus, since the restrictions have been reduced over this past year, the food has gone back to what it used to be. 

A formidable percent of people on campus are vegetarian/vegan, and almost everyone usually tries to eat meatless at least one day a week. There are truly lots of good healthy options for students, I never  found myself thinking ""damn I just want a damn fresh vegetable."" If you wanna just eat pasta and chicken strips you can, there definitely is the standard dining hall food as  well, but that's always supplemented with a salad bars, and several other courses that are a blend of vegetables and meats. They  also use locally-sourced veggies from local New England farms whenever they can. 

As for grocery stores, you need a car or bike typically to access them, but if you don't usually you can borrow someone's car, there are plenty on campus and most Ephs are good about sharing vehicles. There is a stop-n-shop for most groceries, and they have an organic food section (not just a shelf, like a whole part of the store is for organic  groceries.) There is a Wal-Mart further down route 2 about 15 min. away which has less organic food but is massive and has almost anything you would need since it has food, but also clothes, medicine, shampoo, craft supplies, candles, etc. Finally, there is a store near campus called Wild Oats that is an organic food store. It's obviously pricier, but it's all organic, locally-grown foods, and although I never frequented there, my friends who did go there really liked the selection. 

This is a lot of info, but this is all to say that there are lots of healthy fresh food at Williams. So long as you aren't unreasonably picky or have a severe food allergy that requires your own custom-made meals, **for a college campus** the food is definitely high quality and fresh.",8,here4theoffice,2

Williams is waaay more sports-oriented. Most students play a varsity sport, and the big teams can be thought of as replacing the role frats/sororities play at schools with a greek system. As noted elsewhere, Amherst offers more academic freedom (no non-major requirements), so you can totally avoid STEM classes if you want (to me that‚Äôs a bug not a feature, but pick your poison). Access to tons of stuff in the 5-college consortium. Access to much more urban/suburban life (nearby Northampton is awesome, and a bit easier to get to Boston).

p90047,h9uj55l,"Hi u/LethalVenom1,

I hope your college app journey is off to a good start.  Echoing u/14thethumb's comment on the same post to r/dartmouth, I think you're putting too much thought into the wrong things right now.  As a preface to my thoughts, I remind you that both Williams and Dartmouth are ""under-graduate centered"" particularly because the schools provide myriad resources for their students to explore different academic arenas before committing to any one career path.  This can be incredibly valuable, and I encourage you to keep this is mind if these two schools are your top choices.

&#x200B;

Something I can vouch for as a current Williams student are the small class sizes and availability of research.  Professors are accessible and, for the most part, invested in students' academic trajectories.  The tutorial classes offered can be very fun - I took two in my first year at the College and had no regrets - courses where I had perhaps my most intimate and productive academic discussions with a professor out of all my classes.  I'd describe classes at Williams as Ivy-level education but with the bonus of accessible professors, more office hours, engaging discussion-based lectures, and incredibly detailed feedback on your tests and assignments - features not always afforded at larger HYPSM schools.

&#x200B;

>'While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in.""

This is where I lost you. Understand that both schools attract top firms and graduate schools each year - at this level, playing the numbers game isn't going to matter.  What you need to look at are the big things: Dartmouth has a dedicated business school, and Williams does not.  I'd imagine Dartmouth's attention to pre-professional programs influences the larger percentage of its graduates who choose to enter consulting after graduation.  That being said, Williams has an incredible Economics and Math department - rest assured, both schools will prepare you for your current career trajectory.  As a Williams student, I'm afraid I'm not in the position to provide any specifics about the quality of Dartmouth courses (or the D-Plan) for your prospective major - I'm sure your crosspost will help you out with that.

&#x200B;

In terms of location, the two schools are similar.  Williams is situated in the bucolic Purple Valley of the Berkshires, and Dartmouth is nestled in the cozy community of Hanover.  You can't go wrong.  Since Williams does not have Greek life, parties and gatherings will take place mostly in dorms or on off-campus housing, and it's relatively quiet and unobtrusive compared to some notorious fraternities at Dartmouth.  Despite the small student population, I've never felt isolated at Williams, nor did I feel like I got to know everyone in the first week of classes.  For me, it's the right size.  I know that feeling is not universal.  One thing I noticed quickly at Williams was the lack of a competitive grade culture.  Williams students are no stranger to stress, but I found we actually bonded over the late nights and difficult tests instead of competing with one another.  Many professors reinforce this collaborative environment with engaging discussions and, in smaller classes, specific attention to each student.  (I've had several classes that have taken place outdoors, and professors who walk campus with their students and regularly invite them into their homes to speak about life!)  It made me so much more comfortable working around others and discussing classes without feeling like it was a constant race for the grade (which, trust me, gets old really fast after you leave high school).

&#x200B;

The most important thing I can convey to you as you finalize your ED schools: talk to current students.   I remember in my own college search having read every online review on College Confidential, r/ApplyingToCollege, and Niche that I could find and stewing over the stats for each school.  This will waste your time.  Talk to real students and ask them about their experiences.  At this stage, I think hearing those stories may help with your final decision.

&#x200B;

Williams College is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a rigorous and uniquely personal academic experience surrounded by natural beauty.  I always liked to walk back from my Economics office hours late at night and look up at the stars - such little light pollution in the Purple Valley makes for some incredible night skies.  On my way to my art history class, I would always walk through the cow pasture on Stone Hill and hang out with them for a bit before heading to the Clark Institute.  Cows?  On a college campus!  Perhaps that anecdote only reinforces the fact that Williamstown truly is in the middle-of-nowhere, but how cool is that?

&#x200B;

I wish you the best of luck - we'd love to have another Eph on campus!",15,parabolicpineapple,1
p90047,h9ugv73,"I am not a current student myself,  but I am the parent of a current student and I am an alumna.

You named what I believe is probably the biggest difference between the culture of the two colleges: fraternities vs. zero fraternities.

Williams has a warm and inclusive feel, aided by structures like the freshman ‚Äúentry‚Äù system. An entry is a group of about 40 students living in the same dorm, sharing three or four unpaid junior advisors who have no disciplinary role whatsoever but function like big brothers/ sisters. The entry system gives every new freshman people to eat with and hang out with from the moment you arrive on campus. ‚ÄúSnacks‚Äù is a tradition of meeting more formally as an entry every Sunday night, but entrymates also go together to plays and concerts and sporting events on campus, and to things like art museums and hikes and apple picking off campus... not to mention eating dinner together or hanging out and studying in the Common Room. The Ephventures orientation program gives you an intense multiday experience exploring the surrounding area, whether by van or by backpacking/camping (freshmen choose their program) that also creates yet another friend group.

Parties at Williams are open to everyone- part of the no-frat thing-  but there is still a lot of drinking going on, especially freshman year. Still, there are many people who either attend parties to hang out but just don‚Äôt drink OR who hang out with their friends attending campus cultural events or just hanging out casually in the dorms.

It is also really easy to join a club or activity at Williams.

Williams actually has great connections in investment banking and consulting, the biggest-name firms (McKinsey, Bain, etc.) come to the campus to recruit, and it is a very popular career choice for Williams students. But Dartmouth is also extremely strong in this area.

A tutorial is, indeed, an amazing experience!  With a very few exceptions (think intro courses in psychology and art history), Williams classes are small and discussion-oriented. And professors are excellent and very accessible.

You mentioned the math and economics departments. Students at Williams love the math department, which is known for its friendly and playful environment as well as being intellectually challenging and good. And economics is the most popular major at Williams.

You said campus matters to you. Williams has a pretty campus in that it has great views of the surrounding mountains. But I think Dartmouth has nicer buildings and a more unified look overall, although the Williams library is impressive and the library quad with its marble blocks is very nice.

The Williams name will be admired by grad schools and by certain employers, such as those in  investment banking or management consulting. In terms of the general public, yes, the Dartmouth name is better known, and if they don‚Äôt know Dartmouth, they will be impressed if you tell them it‚Äôs Ivy League. Whereas your cashier at the local grocery store or your gas attendant or your Great Aunt Sally may never have heard of Williams and not know that it‚Äôs a good school. Generally, there is one of two reactions to saying you go to Williams: ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs such a great school!‚Äù or a blank look and maybe a question, ‚ÄúDo you mean William and Mary? Roger Williams?‚Äù

Both Williams and Dartmouth are outstanding colleges. Good luck in the application process. I hope this helped a little, but hopefully you also will hear more directly from current students at both schools.",10,Wordwoman50,2

pgshak,hbe8c01,"Both colleges are outstanding. You can‚Äôt go wrong here. In fact, there are more similarities than differences between them- all the benefits of a small college, with small classes, close relationships with professors, and deep, rich classroom discussions. In addition, the student bodies at both colleges are intellectually vibrant and enjoy ‚Äúthe life of the mind.‚Äù

In response to your questions, I believe that both colleges are similar from a political standpoint. Both lean liberal, and the students who are the most vocal activists are on the left end of the political spectrum.

There are two commonly made comparisons on these forums that just seem not to match reality. 

One view has Swarthmore as crazily intense and Williams as more relaxed. Honestly, I think that Williams now has all the same intensity that is traditionally attributed to Swarthmore. Plan on studying a lot at either college.

The view of Williams as preppy or jock-heavy also rings false. First, athletes don‚Äôt dominant at all. Yes, there are a lot of athletes, and yes, there are some ways in which certain athletic team cultures can be a bit isolated from the rest of the students. For example, if you are a male fall helmet sport player, you probably will spend more time with your teammates, while the rest of your freshman entry (dorm group) is spending more time together as an entry. However, if you are a nonathlete, except for cheering on your entrymates at some events, you probably won‚Äôt be thinking much about athletics, because you will be busy with other things that interest you, whether those are music groups, theatre groups, a variety of activity or special interest clubs, hiking and the outdoors club, etc., etc. There is so much to do at Williams, and there is a fascinating variety of interests!  The students there tend to be passionate about their intellectual and extracurricular interests, but to have a wide variety of interests!

Second, ‚Äòpreppy‚Äô definitely feels wrong. The students come from a wide variety of backgrounds. And the way the freshman entry is set up, friendships are formed between people from very different backgrounds, socioeconomically and otherwise. In terms of clothing and culture, I would say that most kids wear things like jeans and sweatshirts or T-shirts, and, if I were to unfairly stereotype the wide variety of students, I would probably say ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù is much more predominant than ‚Äúpreppy‚Äù!

So, how to choose between the schools?

Swarthmore is suburban and a short train trip from Philadelphia for a quick weekend visit. Williams is rural and remote, surrounded by breathtakingly beautiful mountains. Swarthmore has a more uniform stone look, while Williams is more of a hodge-podge of architectural styles. You may be drawn more to one physical environment than the other.

Each has its own hallmarks. I know Williams better, so I will speak to its unique attributes:

1. The tutorials are indeed awesome: just two students and one professor, where each week one student writes a paper based on the readings, taking a stance, and the other student responds to it with a critique.
2. The freshman entry system involves about 40 freshmen living together alongside 3-4 unpaid junior advisors, who have no disciplinary functions but act more like big brothers or sisters. There also is the Ephventures orientation program (where you choose your own adventure, which might involve exploring local attractions like art museums or going on a backpacking trip in the mountains). Between the two, you will begin your Williams experience with a built-in group of people alongside you as you adjust to college‚Äî people with whom you will go to dinner, hang out, etc. It‚Äôs a nice way to start your college experience.
3. Winter Study - Whether you‚Äôll love it or hate it, you‚Äôll be at Williams in January, taking one pass-fail course, with a variety of fun topics, travel options, independent study options, etc.
4. The Mountains- Where else would the school song be about mountains and a favorite college tradition be Mountain Day? Mountain Day is a random Friday in October when classes are cancelled that morning so that students can go on organized hikes up the local mountains.
5. Opportunities- The resources are incredible. Financial aid covers not just the basics, but every book you need for class, skiing or snowboarding equipment and costs if you take one of these for PE class, even a suit for your interviews if you need one. And even if you are not an aided student, you will benefit from the college‚Äôs resources by receiving money for your student club to go on trips to tournaments or events, and from alumni-sponsored internships, and various other benefits. And the alumni network is actively involved and very supportive. 
6. Also, you said you like history. The history department at Williams is absolutely amazing! Great courses, wonderful professors.
7. You also said you might pursue a JD. The Law Society at Williams offers both a Moot Court and a Mock Trial Team, and these provide fun socialization as well as some like-minded peers. And the tutorial system will prepare you well for making and defending an argument and critiquing someone else‚Äôs argument!

Two amazing colleges. Try to visit or talk to some current students at each. It may come down to whether you prefer proximity to a city or to the mountains. Or you may just go by your gut feeling, where you feel more ‚Äôat home.‚Äô Probably, in truth, most people who would be happy at one of these colleges would be happy at the other.

Dorm room in 2019-20 had a leak in the ceiling during the year, and it had peeling paint and a broken piece of furniture upon initial arrival in the room. Everything was quickly addressed upon request- but the requests had to be made. Some other people dealt with mice. 

For both of the first two years, family members who visited all reacted that both of those dorms were surprisingly run-down for the  listing price.

I think it is fair to say that Williams puts more money into generous financial aid and unparalleled classroom experiences and other academic opportunities, than into dorm maintenance.

On the plus side:
Unlike at many other colleges, anyone who wants a single is pretty much guaranteed to have one for three out of four years. Some people have singles freshman year and maybe a double with a good friend sophomore year. Others are placed in a double freshman year. Others get singles both years. Nobody ever has to have a double as a junior or senior.

Housing is guaranteed for all four years, unlike at some colleges where you have to find a rental at some point. And almost everyone lives in a college-owned building for all four years.

Everyone has an equal shot at a great room or a crappy room, unlike some colleges where rich kids can buy better places than poor kids. It is a lottery for everyone after freshman year.

They‚Äôre all sort of average, with differences in location/room size/common rooms. There‚Äôs no AC anywhere, but that really doesn‚Äôt matter other than during the summer and maybe first week of the fall.

One thing to know: Williams advertises their freshman housing a lot. For example: 50% of our first year students are in singles! That‚Äôs true, but what they don‚Äôt tell you is that almost 100% of sophomores are in doubles and have the worst housing on campus. This surprises a lot of people when their sophomore housing is a downgrade from freshman year.

Housing is a lottery, but it‚Äôs not all that fair. It changes a bit every year, HCs (like RAs at other colleges) and students with housing accommodations get to choose where to live and pull in multiple friends. TAPSI (affinity/special interest housing) takes over entire NICE dorms. What I‚Äôm saying is, the best housing is taken before the lottery even opens! If you‚Äôre interested in a TAPSI house though, definitely go for it. More and more get added every year!

The other student on the paper graduated the year before I did, so it was two years after graduation for her.)

I spent two summers on campus doing research and interacted with many SMALL students. At that time, at least half (maybe more) were Williams students. The math department is very strong at Williams, so there were a lot of students interested in SMALL.

As for class sizes, most are small, even the calc 1/2 classes. Calc 1/2 were broken up into sections. The highest I took was differential equations. All those classes were maybe 12-20 students.

I am a current student who was also advanced in math as a high schooler (took two semesters of abstract algebra and intro grad level topics courses), and am interested in math grad school!

Topics offered at the 300 and 400 level are varied and interesting, although pretty slow for me (varying from 50 to 90 percent the pace of their grad-level equivalents, with some of the faster courses being complex analysis and Fourier analysis in the math department, and some deep courses in physics as well with a lot of connections to higher level math, eg gravity). That being said, there is significant precedent for people in your situation in math studying away for 1-2 semesters at research institutions (mostly Harvard and Berkeley) in order to fill out their knowledge prior to math grad school! There are also math colloquia, clubs, independent study, and senior thesis (although this is quite far away) to supplement the math you learn in courses.

In summary, you would not be the only person in this situation; dm me if you want more info.

For those that already fulfilled most of the major requirement before coming, maybe less so.

I didn‚Äôt go the research route, but I had a couple of friends write theses that either were published or are in the process of being published.

As for ‚Äúhow it is‚Äù at Williams, I can tell you you‚Äôll get dedicated attention from professors who are there to teach and are very willing to help you if you‚Äôre struggling. This isn‚Äôt usually the case at larger universities where you‚Äôll have a 500 person lecture for BIO101 and will likely be taught by a TA. You‚Äôll have a more intimate relationship with your professors across the board at Williams than you will at a large university. 

(I know they say this in the brochure, but it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs not unusual for students and professors to go out for coffee together or just chat casually. Some will even invite you to your house)

Beyond that, you‚Äôre more likely to get research opportunities as an undergrad at Williams bc the research opps aren‚Äôt taken up by grad students.

2. Yes
3. There are many singles, some doubles, some shitty dorms, and some nice ones. You will probably only get a shitty dorm as a sophomore - freshman and upperclassmen typically have quite livable housing situations.
4. No, but most of the year is cold enough that it's not really a problem.
5. Competitive enough, but your SAT is a little low. Unless you have something that really stands out, it is difficult to get accepted, regardless of test scores.
6. HUGE yes on this one. Beautiful campus. It gets even nicer in the fall, and the winter has its own beauty as well.
7. Yes.
8. The food options are good enough. Sometimes it sucks, but generally it's good.

q1rvb9,hg14zaj,"Just to add to the other comments:

ED is great, if the estimated family contribution on the net price calculator works for your family and you would be happy to attend Williams if you get in. Nearly half the class is admitted ED. Financial aid for internationals is not as sure a thing as it would be at the similar Amherst, which is one of only a very few US colleges to be need blind and meet full need for internationals.

Dorms:  Yes, there is a common area kitchen in many dorms. No air conditioning in the dorms (although I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd do if you have a documented health issue‚Äî they very well might accommodate you with a unit‚Äî you could ask.) It says on their website that wired Ethernet is turned on only if you request it, but there is a procedure for requesting it. There is WiFi everywhere. There are not problems with using a laptop for schoolwork, but Facetime calls work more smoothly in some locations than others.

60% of freshmen live in singles. Your friend group‚Äôs lottery number determines whether or not you will be able to get a single sophomore year‚Äî or if you are friends with a housing coordinator, they can pull you up with them. During junior and senior year, everyone can get a single, and seniors can also enter the co-op lottery.

The weak spot for Williams, amid all its many wonderful strengths, is its attention to quality of life aspects. The dorms are often not so well maintained. Plus the dining is much less good than it is at, for example, Bowdoin or Middlebury. And this year, dining is a disaster: they cut back hours, leading to long lines, made it impossible to reenter the serving area at one venue, and temporarily suffered from a shortage of forks (which was brilliantly spoofed in their student humor publication, The Haystack).

The surroundings are beautiful, and the college takes advantage of its location with walls of glass in the library through which to view the mountains, as well as traditions like Mountain Day, a random Friday in October when it is suddenly announced that classes are cancelled and everyone hikes up the local mountains (organized hikes range from easy to difficult, on different trails, and nonambulatory people can take a bus to the top of a smaller mountain/ hill).

Not all parts of the libraries are open 24 hours, but there is a 24 hour study room in the main library.

It is hard to imagine a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù setting than the remote, rural, college-centered Williamstown.

And, as another poster noted, it is very cool to be an ‚Äòally‚Äô and very uncool to express overt prejudice.

The most amazing and satisfying aspect of Williams, though, is its academics. Brilliant professors and peers you will interact with through many small discussion-oriented classes, including the incomparable two-person tutorials.",3,Wordwoman50,2

1255x78,je2xmyc,"Hello! It's been 25+ years since I was lucky enough to be accepted to Williams. I hope you have as good an experience there as I did. I mention this because some of my comments may be (very) out of date. 

1. When I was there, Williams was known for having one of the toughest As to earn of any college. Because I never really applied for a super elite grad school afterward, it never mattered to me one way or the other. But if you are applying to a super elite post-grad program, well, they'll all know Williams and it shouldn't hurt you. In fact, it will likely help.
2. There is a student gym on campus. No need to go off campus to work out. 
3.  I can't tell you the specific odds for single vs. double (as things have changed in in the intervening years), but I can tell you that I had single all 4 years and had plenty of friends.  
4. I double majored and it was fine (poli sci and biology). The hard part is that you have less of a chance to explore the rest of the departments. Changing is harder the farther in you are, as there are just fewer classes left to fulfill requirements. TBH, I'm confused as to how you were ""accepted for political science."" At least when I was there, you weren't even allowed to declare a major until the end of sophomore year.
5. Has the College changed its AP policies? In the old days, you could use them for placement, and if you had 4 with good grades, you could place out of semester. Except for financial reasons, I can't see why one would want to do that. Williams was great and I had no reason to leave early. Of course, I only had 4 APs, so I guess that's different than your situation. I'm assuming that with your resume, you also got into other comparable institutions - do others have better policies?
6. Can't speak to campus culture now. 
7. I've lived in Chicago and Boston since graduating and while the networks outside of the Northeast are small, they are diehard. 

On another note, you seem exceptionally driven (even by Williams standards) - your discussion of consulting and T14 law schools (on another thread) - are way more intense than anything I was thinking about as I was about to graduate high school. But then again, so are the 10 college and 15 AP courses you claim to have taken. If it's possible, I would try to visit to get a vibe from the campus. I think it's super important as you get a sense of where you're going to be learning for the next 4 years. One thing I loved about the Williams of 25 years ago was how people were super intellectual, while also being sporty, musical and artistic. People worked hard, but they also took the time to build community, follow their pursuits and just get to revel in spending time with a bunch of other really smart people. 

Hope this helps.",7,sithteacher,1
1255x78,je310g4,"1/ not really, classes are just really hard. A C average from Williams won‚Äôt affect most placement unless you are looking at hyper competitive positions/programs. Your transcript will show how you challenge yourself etc etc so don‚Äôt sweat this yet. 

2/ yes, the facilities are world class. Gyms, weight rooms, pool, racquetball, cardio, Rockwall- nearly anything is available. 

3/ not sure lately, but mission has more singles than frosh quad. 

4/ very easy! I mean other than all the class work. But manageable. Also you don‚Äôt declare until soon/junior year so you have time to build out your core credits and prerequisites while exploring different subjects. 

5/ in various subjects you can place into more advanced courses, but you won‚Äôt be able to apply your AP credits to your transcript/degree. It won‚Äôt matter though, you will be able to skip what you already know and free up time to learn new things too. 

6/ Lively debate at WC has been a tradition. The SASA is thriving (or was when I was there). There are core member events and lots of open events sponsored by SASA, they are a very open and welcoming crew.

twjagm,i3g74ie,"Hi!  Not super qualified to answer as a heterosexual male lol but I have gay friends who I know a bit from.  Williams has a queer student union (QSU) which has about 100-150 members (5-7ish percent of campus) which holds parties, club meetings, etc.  People are very expressive on campus, you shouldnt have any issues with expressing yourself however much/little you want to.

As for hookup culture with Lesbians specifically, there is sort of a meme that lesbians at Williams tend to hookup a lot but never really date each other lol.  How true that is I‚Äôm not entirely sure but take from that what you will.

Hi! I‚Äôm a lesbian first year at Williams. Coming from an urban area, the queer scene at Williams was a big adjustment. Objectively there are hundreds of queer students, but it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it. Mainstream parties feel tailored to a pretty hetero hookup culture. There is a QSU that holds events, but they rarely throw parties so it doesn‚Äôt really feel like there‚Äôs a centralized queer community. The queer community has a lot of overlap and feels pretty insular (people know each other/ have mutual friends most of the time). A lot of bisexual people on campus end up in heterosexual relationships, in part because it‚Äôs hard to actually meet someone. I was lucky enough to meet someone, and almost all my friends are queer‚Äî it‚Äôs definitely a different experience from the hookup culture a lot of straight Williams students experience.

2. I'm not sure, but I know there are a lot of on-campus communities for minorities (there's an entire community resource called the Davis Center, which is a space for POC. There's free snacks, a free kitchen to cook in with friends, other resources, etc.)

3. Activities kinda depend. There's lots of restaurants, a movie theater, etc on Spring Street (across the street from the college), the nice Williamstown Library, and more. A lot is definitely on campus. But you can always visit Albany and Vermont; touring Vermont could be a pretty easy option, if you take the 8 AM bus to Vermont, hang out and explore the different stores and events from 8 AM to 3 PM, then take the 3:30 PM bus back to Williams, Pretty nice because the green mountain vermont busses are free.

krewgt,gi9vlq7,"Both of my tutorials were film-related, one called The Video Essay and one called Out of Africa: A Cinematic Por(be)trayal of a Continent. They were both fantastic for me. The former was more concentrated on writing and producing high-quality film analysis in a cinematically-stylized video essay, so I developed the ability to use Adobe Premiere for something serious and quite meaningful instead of the many goofy things I had done in it before. The latter was more concentrated on reading theoretical texts and reading films as texts. Because there was so much emphasis on reading (visual and written texts), I feel like my ability to analyze films within their real life contexts grew so much from that class. Both great courses run by knowledgeable professors who know how to utilize the Tutorial format to optimize the subject they are teaching. Since the meetings themselves require you to put so much work in to prepare, they are that much more thrilling since you really come to know the kind of dynamic you, your partner, and your professor have together. Williams is hard and hard to keep up with, but I‚Äôm not kidding when I say those courses kept me excited and engaged throughout.

zhux34,j00utyy,"Definitely go for the desk jobs, although they are popular. I started as a desk assistant at the special collections, which is a small part of the library with cool old books and very kind, very cool librarians. This job is less popular than other library desk jobs simply because not a lot of people know that it exists. If you're a desk worker you just get to study while on the desk so it's great. 

I got lucky and was able to move onto a research assistant job at the special collections, which pays better, when they learned I was a multilingual intl student at a time when they were looking for people to identify and catalog stuff from my home country. Mine is a special case but I feel like the special collections desk job does offer ways for people to find better employment later on, as I know that some people who started as desk assistants moved on to work full time over the summer etc. And your language ability (if you speak anything besides English fluently) will come in handy under many unexpected circumstances. 

Also I suspect there will be one or two of mundane office jobs open at the beginning of the year because upperclass people who start out with those jobs usually move on to better paying fun jobs like TAing. Like printing, scanning books, distributing posters or advertisements around campus etc. From personal experience the job itself is pretty shitty but in the end you get to meet cool new faculty and staff members who will occasionally offer you a cookie so that is nice. 

Another job I like is backstage crew for dance/theatre shows. You only work for one week, but you have to work for at least 3 hours each day, sometimes up to 5+ hours. Theatre shows may require you to take care of props, help with costume change, clean the stage, etc. Dance shows may make you sweep the stage, help with lighting, set props or instruments on the stage etc. Theatre shows were more time consuming, as they have longer tech weeks. Get your name on the list of people interested in backstage crew. An advertisement poster will be posted somewhere in the 62 center for theatre and dance during the first semester. This is a position that will always be open, since they always need people for any type of show they do. 

Handshake is a platform that williams uses for on-campus jobs and you will be guided through it during orientation. browse through that occasionally. actual employment won't happen until after the beginning of class, whereas advertisements will probably be posted late august - early september. I don't know if shooting people an email looking for jobs will work, but you could also try doing that if you know for sure you want to work for a certain department/office. Definitely ask other people (especially your international orientation leaders) about what kind of jobs they have/had first if you want to go for the email method, because i feel like there are lots of positions that you can reasonably shoot for, but only a handful of them are actually advertised. Who knows, maybe some department thought they didn't need help with scanning books but would actually benefit from your help... 

As an intl they tell you during orientation that off-campus jobs are a no and will get your visa cancelled. Idk if there are people who do it sneakily, but I personally don't know a single intl person who has an off campus job and it's most probable that nobody can actually do that lol.

Cons:
-limited seats (and unfilled roles) in faculty: this may not still be the case, but years ago the dept faced cuts and hiring freezes/challenges that left it understaffed.

In the case, that it is/was a building of the college, I recommend using the [Gulielmensian](https://unbound.williams.edu/williamsarchives/islandora/object/gulielmensian%3Ayearbooks), which is the single best resource that chronicles the history of Williams College. If this doesn't work, I'd recommend reaching out to Williams College Special Collections‚Äîthey may be able to help narrow it down for you.

Let me know if you end up finding out more!

Edit: these people clearly appear to be socialites, so I would do a deep dive into Western Massachusetts estates. I know that the Elm Tree House was owned by Alta Rockefeller‚Äîso maybe it's possible that you could identify friends of hers or the family who likely owned estates in the Berkshires.

So, I noticed you've been doing a lot of different activities. Yoga, teaching English, website, research paper, and dance... you've got a really diverse skillset. I think it could make for a really strong application if you found some way to tie those activities together in an essay or some other piece of writing, if there's any connection that can be made. For example, imagine writing like, ""I really like helping others, and by teaching this kid English and teaching others yoga, I've been able to help people with both the mental and physical parts of life. I hope to do more like this for others at Williams."" Or something like that haha. When a person ties together the different things they do, it can make them seem like a super powerful character or something, haha

Btw, how come you're planning on making slight changes to the common app essay? Do you feel like it was a good essay and you just wanna tweak a few things, or do you think the Williams peeps didn't like it? I think the essay can be a really strong point to win over the advisors, so I'd recommend showing it to peeps like friends and teachers and see what others think.

1higilp,m33nlel,"One good way to describe a liberal arts education from Williams College is that they have a goal to give you as much of the breadth of knowledge that humanity had amassed over several thousand years in 4 years. This prepares you very well for graduate programs.

1higilp,m3gi5nq,"Every person comes back from WEPO and says that the education at Oxford PALES in comparison to Williams. And, at Williams, you can choose to go to Oxford!

1higilp,m32b3cp,"At Williams, the only requirement is that you complete three courses in each academic division: division I (humanities), division II (social sciences), and division III (STEM). You also need to complete two writing intensives, one quantitative, and one diversity/culturally centered class. 

Majors usually require around 9 credits (you earn 32 over eight semesters when taking a regular course load). Over your first two years, you can take no more than 5 classes of the same course prefix. So, if you wanted to take as many classes in your major as possible (let‚Äôs assume that this hypothetical major has no requirements outside the major), then you‚Äôd be able to take 21 out of 32 courses in your major (5 + 8 + 8), or around 66% of your classes. 

That‚Äôs the minimum, of course, as some majors like computer science (and physics iirc) have a math requirement, and others like language majors require some history/social component that may be taken outside of the major department‚Äôs prefix (i.e., a history class relating to the USSR might be cross listed as RUSS and HIST), which gets around the early concentration limits.

The systems for Oxford and Williams are very different, with Oxford offering 3 year degrees and Williams offering 4 year degrees. Some degrees offered at Oxford are not offered at Williams and vice versa; the biggest difference you will find is that Oxford graduates will be more employable in the UK while Williams graduates will be more employable in the US. I have heard that Williams and Oxford are comparable in terms of rigor, but someone who has done WEPO would be better suited to answer that.

If you wanted to, it is entirely possible to triple major at Williams if you planned it well. Double majoring is extremely common, or even having a major and two minors. The magic of a liberal arts college like Williams is that there is much room to explore a variety of topics in as much depth as you‚Äôd like to (short of graduate-level courses, excluding art history).",3,Solivont,3

1gjkuo9,m43ruz1,"In regards to your question about applying for a particular kind of housing, you fill out a form early in the summer where you rank the 4 options: single in frosh quad, double in frosh quad, single in mission, double in mission. 

Single in frosh quad is the most difficult to get. No one wants a double in mission. 

I somewhat agree with the comment that Williams does a good job with roommates, however a lot of my friends unfortunately didn‚Äôt luck out. That‚Äôs why I tried to get a single in frosh as my first choice and single in mission as my second choice. I felt a single was best for me to assimilate into college without having to worry about roommate issues. But of course to each their own as having a roommate is a vital aspect of experiencing college life. I‚Äôm sure as a sophomore I‚Äôll end up in a double unless I somehow get a single (which is uncommon for upperclassmen).

I‚Äôm currently in mission as a freshman and although the hill sometimes is a drag, it really isn‚Äôt all that bad. The dining hall is such a plus, during finals week when it was cold I didn‚Äôt have to venture outside, and mission brunch on the weekends is the best dining the school offers tbh. Also mission has hundreds of rooms, it‚Äôs 4 floors of just singles (there‚Äôs maybe a handful of doubles thrown in) so you are definitely not alone. The mission common rooms are super nice (much better than frosh quad in my opinion) and my entry (this is what we call ppl in your ‚Äúhall‚Äù) loves spending time together on the couches watching tv etc. It really makes up for the extra 2 min walk down the Mission Hill lol. I personally can‚Äôt speak for the frosh quad environment but from what I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre also super friendly with each other and get along in their entries.

Population varies by year but it tends to be a small major, albeit with a lot of non-majors taking classes, especially those who had Latin or Greek in prep school. I'm now in humanities grad school and using the Greek skills I built at Williams every day for my courses and dissertation research, so I would say it served me well, although I also know people who went on to law, finance, consulting, or even med school by taking the requisite courses on the side or double-majoring.

  
The curriculum varies a bit depending on if you want to focus on Greek, Latin, or content-courses (note that either way you'll take 4 semesters in at least one of Greek or Latin). I did a Greek-focused path so I took Greek pretty much every semester my last 3 years, with some Latin and Classical studies mixed in.

  
As for comparing it to other majors, it depends on what you're considering, but I'll reiterate that double or even triple majoring with Classics is possible. WIth all humanities I will say you are best majoring in them if you're actually interested in them, but if you are, the major will be a deeply enriching experience and ultimately help you get where you want to go.

1fc2p7m,lmf7r5n,"I am a current student at Williams who considered the classics major, but ended up declaring something else. Classics is a fantastic department, with a high concentration of some of the best professors at Williams. The quality of the teaching is stellar and, because of the department's small size (around 5-10 majors each year), it really feels like a community. The department is also among the most generous with funding for fellowships, etc. As far as curriculum, there are two paths towards the major -- one which emphasizes language courses in either Latin or Greek, and another with more coursework in classical studies (culture, history, literature in translation). Even if you take the classical studies route, you can expect to take a fair amount of Latin/Greek, and the language courses are intense (especially at the intro level) but very rewarding. At the intermediate and advanced levels, you typically read a text in the original Greek/Latin. Discussions and assessments focus mostly on content, so they are basically literature classes, but you are learning a lot of grammar along the way. The pace is fast, discussions in-depth, and the class sizes small. While I did not end up being a classics major, I loved the courses I took and cannot speak highly enough of the department.

There aren't a ton of classics majors, but we're a really tight-knit group. And the professors are absolutely wonderful. In my opinion, they are the nicest department on campus. The language classes are quite intense, but other than that the classes aren't very hard and are a lot of fun. We also have a yearly Parilia event where they bring a bunch of sheep from a local farm to campus and you have class surrounded by sheep. Seriously, the classics dept is awesome. 

Williams is great because you don't have to lock in too early and you have plenty of options, so I'd recommend taking a few courses and seeing how you feel about it. You don't have to lock into one thing from the start.

1expskv,lj936w0,"If I had to take a guess, the reason why not many people decide to do 3-2 or 4-2 programs between liberal arts colleges and research universities is simple: space, cost, and time.

These 3-2 and 4-2 programs often have limited seating and network with an array of institutions; Williams offers this 3-2 in conjunction with Columbia, but Columbia almost certainly has a similar pathway set up with several other colleges as well. You still have to go through an admissions process and meet all prerequisites to participate in programs like this.

An additional two years of college isn‚Äôt free, either. Whether you pursue the 3-2 or the 4-2 pathway, that‚Äôs one to two years more you‚Äôd have to pay, and not necessarily at the same rates you‚Äôd been paying at your home institution. For many people, an extra year or two of tuition (an extra year or two of loans) isn‚Äôt worth receiving two bachelor‚Äôs degrees, especially when Williams (and other top LAC) graduates are already on track to graduate with a degree that performs well in the job market (and among graduate schools).

Time is the last general factor that comes to mind. Think of it this way: if you graduate with your bachelor‚Äôs in Physics and pursue a master‚Äôs im engineering immediately after, you‚Äôll be spending five to six years (more or less) on earning these two degrees. You‚Äôd be spending the same amount of time by doing a 3-2 or 4-2 program, but instead of a bachelor‚Äôs and a master‚Äôs, you‚Äôd be coming away with two bachelor‚Äôs. Regardless of how many bachelor‚Äôs you have, some jobs will still require or prefer candidates to have a master‚Äôs degree. For jobs that require or prefer a bachelor‚Äôs, well, you already had that box checked a year or two ago.

Whether or not these programs provide an admissions benefit to master‚Äôs programs, I can‚Äôt say. If you‚Äôre a physics major who has taken advantage of opportunities available (academic year research, summer research, internships, etc) then I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm inclined to believe that an extra bachelor‚Äôs degree would give you a significant benefit in graduate admissions.

The last thing I‚Äôll mention regarding these 3-2 and 4-2 programs is that, like you speculate about in your question, Williams *does* have a strong community and alumni network. According to the Williams website on their 3-2/4-2 program with Columbia, many students who are admitted to the program ultimately choose not to participate in it because of the community at Williams, both during and after your years there.

In some ways, yes. You will struggle because the things they teach you in private school are different from what they teach you in public school. For instance, there‚Äôs a gap between the writing quality from public school kids and private school kids not because of any inherent skill but because private school kids usually had smaller class sizes and got more feedback and mentorship early on. 
In other ways no because even some private kids struggle here because while you‚Äôre used to being the top of your class, that just isn‚Äôt the case at Williams. It‚Äôs harder to get As and it‚Äôs harder to be stellar when that‚Äôs a norm.

17n14vs,k7roqsy,"I don‚Äôt want to be Negative Nancy, but chances are even lower than 3.06%. Most transfer applicants are from community college or more traditionally underprivileged education background. The stat also includes veterans, I think. This means transferring from another 4-year accredited college is very difficult.

That said, here is my advice. Williams of course cares about academic excellence and ECAs, but that is the expected standard and not enough. In crafting your application, focus on these questions:

1. What makes you unsatisfied with your current environment? What do you learn from it?(Don‚Äôt be bashing it too much though, more like ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt a fit‚Äù)

2. Why do you think Williams fulfills what was lacking at your old institution? 

3. What is your idea of the Williams community (kinda overlap with the previous question)? How can you contribute to this community?

4. Why are you an academic fit with the school?

In answering these questions, find an angle about you (personality, career, one activity, etc.) that underly every answer. This helps you appear clearer to the readers and makes your application consistent and a stand out.

I‚Äôd also suggest be really specific about your answers, do your own research first, then perhaps ask more specific questions. I‚Äôll also be honest that any answers in the vein of ‚Äúbecause Williams is a good school,‚Äù ‚ÄúWilliams grads make money,‚Äù or prestige, etc. will result in a sure rejection.

1. some required courses for your major (which you can sometimes talk your way out of if they don't make sense for you) or grad school entrance requirements
2. Courses you choose based on the professor. Almost always choosing courses based on professor makes sense; you can always learn stuff but learning from and with great people is amazing.
3. Courses you choose because the content is super interesting. Much lower priority than #2 but this happens.
4. I'll probably get downvoted for thisbut should mention courses you choose in part because of the time of day. This is unusual, but studies show you perform better if you don't try to take classes with different sleep schedules than you use. I only did this one semester, and it seems absurd, but it worked surprisingly well.

Only some courses you want to take will have tutorials. By all means though, take the tutorials when you are interested. If you got in you're bright enough to do it, it's just a 2-on-1 with a professor once a week and assigned reading etc...; my guess is half the students not doing it either means they don't see ones they are interested in (small departments may only have a few and large departments may have a lot of students), they don't get into them, or maybe they don't want to be in 1-on-2 course meetings with professors (it will be very obvious if you didn't do the work).",4,tcpWalker,1

mi3re5,gt51o9n,"This is a very common path, and Williams is very well-connected in government, law, and policy. Williams has one of the highest number of current alumni serving in office (4 in the House of Representatives, 1 senator, tons of state congresspeople, a few members of the extended presidential cabinet, etc.), not to mention the College is very well-respected in DC and several prominent lobbying/PR firms and law firms were founded by Williams alumni. There is an annual trek to DC that the career center organizes (paid for by the College) where students go to DC and meet alumni working in government, policy, and think-tanks. I can give you more info on how well Williams is represented on Capitol Hill to assuage any concerns you may have, but given how strong the alumni network is and how well alumni do in this field, Williams will give you a huge advantage when trying to enter this field down-the-line.

Generally speaking, the political science major at Williams works like this -- you major in Political Science, but you have to specialize in one of four subfields (international relations, political theory, etc.). Additionally, you can also concentrate in global studies and/or double-major in a language/ethnic studies, leadership studies, etc. Further, there is a Political Economy major, which is fairly unique, and is essentially a Public Policy major, and you can double major in PoliSci and Econ if you were interested in both. The major itself is really flexible like that.

Lastly, Williams offers tremendous opportunities outside of academics to gain exposure to foreign policy, policy research, etc. Williams showers undergrads with grants for research, travel, foreign language study, policy research, etc., and this aspect of Williams can't really be found at other colleges. All-in-all, Williams will help you tremendously with trying to enter the foreign policy/government field.

A lot of political science classes at Williams are very much foreign policy related as well. I think a major in political science or political economy coupled with electives in economics, sociology, and environmental studies might be your best option.

Economics is a bit more abstract and quantitative than I think a lot of people realize before coming, especially in the core courses.",3,Stone2443,2
mi3re5,gt5kdke,"You've gotten some good responses here, but I just want to add that if you're interested in foreign policy at Williams you're right, there is no specific global affairs program, but Williams prides itself on staying at its Liberal Arts roots.

It's not a school where many people specialize early on. Sure you have some people going on one path early and sticking to it, but you can save your specialization for your graduate program. I would recommend using Williams as a place to learn how to learn, and a place to expand your horizons. You want to take courses from professors that interest you, and courses you might not have chances to take in the future. 

As was mentioned elsewhere Williams has connections and courses that will set you up well for a career in politics both foreign and domestic. But take your time working out how you want to achieve those goals. You could go into public policy, go into a think tank, get a masters or phd degree, get a law degree and practice, or even use Williams as a jumping off for a political career. My one recommendation would be to not limit yourself because they don't have 'X' major. Take your time, experiment with courses and professors and with your idea of what you want to do. Then when you find your direction you'll have the network and skills to make that idea reality.

You're absolutely right to doubt that the supplemental essay is really optional. Although I'm sure it's possible to get in without writing one, putting in the extra effort and doing it is a great way to reaffirm your interest in Williams. With a school as selective as Williams, it's best to do everything possible to give your application an edge.  

All in all, I think it's a better idea to write a new essay responding to one of their prompts than to submit an academic paper. Submitting a paper you've already written takes less effort than writing an entirely new essay, and it's best to avoid anything that could be interpreted as laziness/lack of interest in Williams.

At Williams, there are three academic divisions‚Äîlanguage and the arts (Division I), social studies (Division II), and science and mathematics (Division III). History, of course, falls under Division II, social studies, so it would be rather hypocritical of Williams to say that history doesn‚Äôt count as a social science. In short, subject-wise you‚Äôll be perfectly fine! They‚Äôd only really have an issue if someone went way out of bounds and submitted a paper written for a science class or similar.

The goal of the academic paper is to get a sense of your writing and thinking style in an academic setting, if that makes any sense. They don‚Äôt want to see a lab report or research synopsis, they want to see you as a thinker in a liberal arts setting. The paper I submitted for college apps was my take on the hypocrisy of the American political climate, which I wrote for an English class. The only thing I‚Äôd caution about with your history paper is whether it is mostly analysis and commentary (good, in this case) or large chunks of evidence, quoted or paraphrased (much less good, in terms of what Williams probably wants to see). If the bulk of it is your own analysis and thoughts, go ahead and use it! If it‚Äôs largely excerpts or big chunks of evidence, maybe weigh it against your English paper‚Äîwhich one shows your way of thinking best? Which one paints you as a writer (and subsequently, shows your personality) most accurately?

No matter which one you choose, best of luck with your WOW application! Also, one last thought: make sure that whatever paper you submit meets the minimum length suggested by Williams. Don‚Äôt worry as much if it goes over the max by a page or two‚Äîit‚Äôs better to give them too much material than not enough. Once again, good luck!",4,Solivont,1

The department mostly privileges contemporary plays, and to a lesser degree, musicals and classical plays (Elizabethan/Jacobean and Ancient Greek).

The departmental productions are led by faculty and feature theater professionals. The department also sponsors performances that are part of students‚Äô honor thesis projects in the major. Theses are very diverse, often original works but can also be existing works.

In addition to these shows, the student-led theater group Cap and Bells features 3 full productions, often including one musical, a semester, sometimes with additional stage readings and one-act plays. Recent musicals include Urinetown, Pippin, Mama Mia, Next to Normal.

1d1z1j6,l5xswv0,"Don't double major just because it ""looks good on a resume"", chances are you might be much better off single majoring and getting higher grades. Double majoring itself isn't exactly anything especially hard, it just means you consistently take courses on the same two departments at Williams. A lot of people make it into finance by just single majoring. I will say that being a student athlete generally isn't the easiest since you have a pretty consistent time commitment each week outside of academics, but you can pull it off with good time management and by communicating with your profs (ie if you need an extension due to a game).

1cxot07,l54p4hv,"So there‚Äôs definitely a bit of an abnormality this year with waitlist admits! There were 3 people admitted off the waitlist for 2023-2024, 0 for 2022-2023, and 1 for 2021-2022. However, in 2020-2021, 73 people were admitted off the waitlist, and in years prior 20-25 waitlist admits seems to hold true enough. The uncertainty of financial aid with the FAFSA and the overturning of affirmative action means that there will likely be a lot more waitlist movement this year than previous years for top private colleges and universities, most likely due to a greater number of cross admits (applicants who are admitted to multiple top colleges with traditionally high yields) as well as admitted students to these top colleges committing to state flagships if financial aid isn‚Äôt coming through.

However, another contributing factor to Williams‚Äô waitlist movement could be the sheer number of applications they received this year, which was 4,000 more than last year. It is possible that Williams was a bit more conservative in the number they‚Äôd admit than usual, or (and based upon an article from the Williams Record, I‚Äôm inclined more towards this) that the number of cross admits and financially uncertain students was large enough that they had a noted deficiency in class size (let‚Äôs say 20-50 spots) and are now admitting from the waitlist, which some people have surely been declining either due to insufficient financial aid or having decided to commit elsewhere (cross admits would affect the waitlist as well). What could be a bid to fill 40 spots could lead to 120 waitlist admits if there isn‚Äôt high interest or means from who they are admitting‚Äîthe choice to do away with a supplement this cycle could be a big impact on their ability to gage interest as well.

This year, my liberal guesstimate would be that 150 people or less were brought in off of the waitlist. My conservative guesstimate would be closer to 75, as seen in 2020-2021. Regardless, it‚Äôs good for us (I‚Äôm a fellow waitlist admit) and negligible to Williams‚Äô acceptance rate given the massive increase in applications, so who‚Äôs complaining?

1cttseo,l4f098f,"Oh my god! I‚Äôve been waiting for this question. You can DM me but I‚Äôll leave some general info here

1; Major at an overview, more info on website:

Theater here is a liberal arts program, meaning you do NOT hyperfixate on one aspect of theater, such as acting, with daily studio work. Instead, the program is interdisciplinary. Every major has to complete 4 courses covering theory, design, and dramaturgy. Then you can have 5 electives (200s and 300s level) and be a bit more focused with those. The major also requires 4 credits with department productions, one of which must be in stage management and three of which can be in whatever aspect as long as the involvement is sustained throughout (performing, designing, directing, etc.)

EDIT: They often hire visiting artists and professors to teach more practical classes, like acting. Next year seems very abundant in studio acting classes.

2; What kind of department productions are put on?

The department has 2 shows per year, one per semester. Faculty members vote on what is produced, and it is different year to year.

This past year, we did Dance Nation in the fall, a contemporary feminist play, and Natasha, Pierre, and The Great Comet of 1812 for the spring, a musical.

Next fall, we are indeed doing Shakespeare, specifically Much To Do Bout Nothing. Spring TBD.

3; Outside of department productions, which are led by faculty and professional artists, there are many opportunities to perform with student run groups: Cap and Bells, the student-run theater group, the film club, stand up clubs, slam poetry, choir, student dance groups, acapella groups, and student honors theses in Theater (maybe even more). Diverse productions; diverse interests; diverse experience‚Äîhighly subject to what an individual wants.

4; Williamstown Theater Festival

It still exists, still pretty available every summer. HOWEVER, it has gone significantly downhill following a scandal in 2019. Their attempts to reestablish themselves have been abysmal.

Other than WTF, we have Barrington Stage Company and Shakespeare & Co which are pretty big regionally.

5; Final recommendations

The department is overall strong. There are many alum working successfully in the field. This semester (spring 24), 2 alums visited Williams to present their works in progress and talk with students.

Best to pursue if:

1. You want to be a multifaceted, well-rounded theatermaker.
2. Plan to get conservatory training, like an MFA, later.
3. Simultaneously want to do or learn something else other than theater.
4. Is open to job opportunities beyond the theater
5. Want to pursue theater academically postgrad, such as a PhD in Performance Studies, Theater Studies, Theater History, etc.

I highly recommend Williams for theater. In today‚Äôs world, an artist has to be a critic and thinker who is knowledgeable. This place is a wonderful incubator for such an artist.",10,hth1hth1,1

1.  Take it easy, don‚Äôt be greedy.

In high school we try to do everything possible for college applications. That is no longer true. It is okay to ‚Äúmiss out‚Äù and focus on either what you love most or deem most helpful.

2. Reach out for help

Whether academically or socially, so many people are here for you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help.

3. Better be safe than sorry, take it easy

Err on the side of caution. Give your homework a bit more time. Do a little less. Take courses slightly easier than your absolute max capacity. After the fall, adjust accordingly. I approached college in the crash and burn style, which was not the best.

4. Have faith that things will be alright

There‚Äôs not much to elaborate here. Things will be fine. Have faith in yourself. You‚Äôre more capable than you think. And if things aren‚Äôt fine, there are those struggling, too. You can survive anything.
