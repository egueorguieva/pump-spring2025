I see a couple other noteworthy changes in here not being mentioned:

1. Institute no longer qualifies one to live in BYU housing. This means that neither UVU students nor recent graduates are allowed to live in BYU contracted off-campus housing.
2. BYU students with more than two semesters still *can* live in contracted off-campus housing, but the implication of ""limited space"" is that contractors are required to give preference to newer students.

I strongly suspect this will not affect rent prices as much as people here think it will. Yes, you now have more options, but Redstone, Aspen Ridge, Continental, and all the other property management companies still own most of the properties in the area. True, they won't have a captive market in the sense that students have to live in approved housing, but they also no longer have to follow off-campus housing regulations. Here are some things I would expect to see from the scummier management companies:

1. Expect to see rent stay about the same but with the addition of a monthly fee for apartment furnishings.
2. Crappy properties near the university (especially south of campus) that have previously been forced to provide some basic maintenance in order to keep their contracted housing status will probably get crappier.

Some other consequences I would expect to see in the immediate future:

1. Parking will become even more competitive. With more students choosing to live in Orem, Springville, and other parts of Provo to get cheaper rent, more students will have to commute to school. I'd find some carpool buddies or take advantage of the fact that your student ID doubles as a bus pass.
2. There will be a significant reshuffling of YSA stake and ward boundaries. With less contracted housing necessary, apartments will begin retooling themselves to offer spots to families, older single adults, and non-members. YSA wards near the university will stay much the same, but those a little further out will become somewhat more spread out (now it'll be a city block instead of a single apartment complex). Much further from the university, YSA wards will become more compact as students begin renting homes or apartments previously occupied by families and older adults.
3. There will be a very strong change in the culture for YSA wards. Contracted housing will comprise mostly of younger students, and off-campus, non-contracted housing will be mostly older students.",76.0,geekusprimus

I'm an undergrad student here at BYU and I feel very lost and confused. After spending the last good while (2+ years) studying and learning about LDS theology, I no longer believe it. I just don't. I'm not here to argue about that or talk about specifics. It is a decision backed by more careful thought and study than anything else I have done up to this point in my life. I even ended up returning home early from my mission because of it (mostly painted over as a 'mental health' exit), but I still ended up back here for the finances/convenience. I am thinking now that it may have been a mistake. I feel so alone, like nobody does or could understand me. I don't know what my next step should be. I've been thinking about transferring literally anywhere but I'm so far along in terms of credits here that I think it may set my life back a good bit, not to mention essentially uprooting all of my social circles and likely completely changing my family relationships. I just don't even know if its worth it, do I just shut up and drag myself through the next couple years? Is it even an option to stay? I do really like BYU I just can't anymore with the church, I have like zero desire to attend Sunday meetings or even pretend like I care about the LDS lifestyle you know? I lowkey just need someone who's gone through what I'm going through or understands what I'm saying cause I have no one that seems to get it. I'm sorry if this reads like a trash can of unorganized thoughts cause it basically is haha but I'd love any advice. Thanks :)",kharjwi,"Hi, BYU professor here who feels for you. This is a tough situation. My first bit of advice would be to be honest with yourself. If you are miserable and do not want to continue to follow the honor code, then it would probably be better to transfer. I don't know the specifics of your credit situation, but I know several students who have transferred and things have worked out great for them.   


Second, I also have had close relationships with several students who were not members of the church, but who had great experiences here. While theirs was a different situation, I think it speaks to the fact that if you feel you can continue to abide by the rules of the university, even though you don't believe as you once did, you can certainly still have a good experience here. We would love to still have you with us.   


Finally, on the subject of feeling lonely and like you don't have someone to talk to: I would definitely recommend talking to a counselor/therapist. This is a difficult period in life. You are certainly experiencing many stressors. I have personally found that counseling has helped me very much. You might also consider talking to your bishop. I have worked with many bishops and they are almost universally kind and generous people who often understand much better than you might think. I don't say this out of an attempt to persuade you to change your opinion of the church. I do so simply to note that there is a person who cares about you that you can talk to.",123.0,New-Slide9507,khbkiqe,"I'm a former BYU professor who is also a former member of the Church (had a faith crisis/transition after I left BYU for unrelated reasons). I'm part of the Free BYU group (which tries to improve the systems which make things so precarious for students who have a faith crisis/transition while at BYU). I also co-founded an interfaith dialogue group with the BYU religious dept where we dialogued with BYU religion professors, BYU faculty (like counselors), and BYU administration for many years on faith crisis and member/former member relationships, especially as it relates to BYU students. [If anyone cares to vet any of this information I'm happy to provide references or links which should make it easy.]

Lots of great advice here already from everyone about pros and cons of leaving vs. staying. That's a very tough decision. I've heard stories about people who are really glad that they left. I've also heard of people who have had reasonably good experiences staying and making the best of it. I'm confident you'll make the right decision for you.

If you were to stay (again, not recommending one course of action over the other), here are some things that can help:

1. *Check out the [BYU Survival Guide](https://byusurvivalguide.com/)* - lots of great info in here.
2. *Consider connecting with the underground BYU group of non-believing students.* I discuss the group a bit more and how you can get in contact with the group in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/18obqhn/byu_is_killing_me/kei3qdf/).
3. *Definitely talk with a BYU Counselor.* BYU Counseling has confirmed to us that counselors are bound by client confidentiality (i.e., it cannot influence your ecclesiastical endorsement in any way). One of my good friends was a BYU Counselor/Professor. He estimates that 1/3 of the students he was counseling were dealing with faith crisis issues on some level. So, this is both safe and recommended! If you stay, you should definitely do this! Our dialogue group talked with all the counselors in a panel discussion and I got the sense that they are very committed to helping and supporting students who may have gone through a faith transition.
4. *Talking with your Bishop about a faith transition is risky.* I love /u/New-Slide9507's and /u/Admirable-Stand9964's advice generally. I agree that most Bishops are incredibly kind hearted and only want the best for their students. However, **if you speak with a Bishop about a faith transition at BYU you run a real risk of not getting an ecclesiastical endorsement and/or expulsion** (worst case, without a transcript) because there are _some_ Bishops who are more hard-line. You can go talk to the Free BYU facebook group if you want to hear more of these kinds of stories. [/u/New-Slide9507 and /u/Admirable-Stand9964, I would encourage you to formally or informally petition BYU to make it _structurally more safe_ for students to confide in their Bishop so that you can _responsibly_ recommend this course of action to students who have gone through a faith transition. You cannot guarantee that a student's Bishop will not withhold an endorsement if a student confides to losing belief, and there are plenty of examples of students who have lost endorsements for this, so even though it's not likely, it's still a real risk.]

s8p27w,BYU is under federal investigation for how it disciplines LGBTQ students (Salt Lake Tribune),444,https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2022/01/20/byu-is-under-federal/,223,2022-01-20 18:07:05+00:00,-lonely_rose-,,hthldi8,"“The U.S. Department of Education has launched an investigation into Brigham Young University and how it disciplines its LGBTQ students to determine whether the private religious school is violating their civil rights.

This type of federal scrutiny is surprising and rare, especially with church-owned schools like BYU — it typically happens only in places where there are believed to be potential systemic or serious issues.

“It’s really significant that investigators are stepping in now,” said Michael Austin, a BYU alumnus and vice president at the University of Evansville, a private Methodist school in Indiana. “It means there’s some reason to think the university has gone beyond the religious exemptions it has and is discriminating even beyond those.”

The investigation of BYU officially started late last year and it concerns Title IX, the federal law that protects against discrimination on the basis of sex in schools.

Federal investigators were first alerted to a possible issue at BYU, which is operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, after a complaint was filed in response to changes made to the school’s strict Honor Code in spring 2020.

At the time, the university had removed a controversial section from the rules that banned “homosexual behavior.” Some students celebrated, openly coming out as queer after, they said, school officials told them it was OK. But a few weeks later, the school clarified that same-sex partnerships would still be prohibited, even if the ban was no longer expressly written.

Those who act against that instruction by holding hands or kissing, according to administrators, could continue to face discipline. LGBTQ students protested, saying they felt gaslit and tricked into coming out.

The investigation, headed by the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education, will examine whether such actions by BYU are allowable because it is a private school or if they violate LGBTQ students’ rights, by disciplining them more harshly than heterosexual peers who don’t face the same consequences for similar romantic behaviors.

A spokesperson for the Department of Education did not return a request for comment on the investigation. The Salt Lake Tribune has submitted a public records request for a copy of the original complaint.

University spokesperson Carri Jenkins said in a statement that she believes the federal office will find BYU is properly exempt and within its rights to enforce the church’s policies against same-sex relationships.

“BYU is exempt from application of Title IX rules that conflict with the religious tenets of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,” Jenkins said. “BYU does not anticipate any further action by OCR on this complaint.”

But the investigation comes after the school has repeatedly been in the national spotlight in the past two years for how it treats LGBTQ students and as many have been pushing for change.

Last year, several students signed onto a lawsuit, alleging discrimination there because of their identifies. One is a recent graduate who is lesbian and said she lost her job at the school because she didn’t look “feminine enough” to her boss. And a group of students spoke out against the school’s policies by lighting the iconic “Y” on the mountain above BYU in rainbow colors.

In response, the university has now banned protests on that property. It also refused take any public action after a professor called a gay student a term associated with an anti-Christ.

And, last fall, a top-ranking apostle of the LDS Church came to campus and criticized faculty members and students who challenge the faith’s teachings on same-sex marriage. He said they should instead take up their intellectual “muskets” to defend “the doctrine of the family and ... marriage as the union of a man and a woman” — even if that costs the school some “professional associations and certifications.” The school’s accreditation has an upcoming review in April.

Some hope the federal investigation might finally end the crossfire.

Religious exemptions

BYU began receiving religious exemptions from Title IX in 1976, becoming the first school to ever do so and leading the charge for private universities across the country to follow.

In a strongly worded letter to the Department of Education at the time, then-BYU President Dallin Oaks bristled at the federal government having any power to control or limit BYU, according to an article about Title IX in higher education from the Kansas Law Review.

The president maintained that as a private religious school, BYU had the right to ask employees and prospective students about their marital status, if they had children out of wedlock (with the faith standing strongly against premarital sex) or if they had previously had an abortion, “because [BYU] condemns promiscuity,” according to Oak’s letter. It also stated it could enforce a dress code, with different requirements for men and women.

Oaks wasn’t asking for permission, but rather notifying the department, which acknowledged the letter by giving out formal exemptions.

Those exemptions continue to apply to BYU today, among 15 total exemptions that the school now has related to sexuality and gender expression.

Its protected actions include the ability to enforce its own preferences while recruiting and admitting students and giving out financial aid. For instance, if a student is openly gay, BYU is permitted under the law to deny him a scholarship. The school can also limit the use of bathrooms based on sex assigned at birth.

“Technically, BYU is allowed to discriminate in those areas,” Austin said.

What’s at question with the new investigation, Austin believes, is whether those exemptions allow BYU to discipline LGBTQ students beyond that, based on the faith’s teachings.

For example, he asks: Can the school punish a gay student for holding hands, when that’s not directly related to education? Is it OK for the university to expel a transgender student for doing something that would not get a heterosexual student into trouble?

Students must agree to uphold the Honor Code when they come into BYU, Austin notes, signing a document vowing to do so. But if the ban on “homosexual behavior” isn’t written in that any more, can students still be held to that?

Current university President Kevin Worthen wrote a letter to the Department of Education last November, shortly after receiving notice of the investigation, saying it still applies.

“All BYU students, faculty, administrators, and staff,” he wrote, “agree to the Church Educational System Honor Code and thereby ‘voluntarily commit to conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’”

But Austin wonders if removing that section in February 2020 changed the way the Department of Education views the school’s rules.

How students feel

Carolyn Gasset is the president of the unofficial club of LGBTQ students at BYU known as USGA (Understanding Sexuality, Gender and Allyship).

Currently, its members are not allowed to meet on campus. That is allowed under the exemptions BYU has to Title IX because the school has express permission to ban associations from its private property.

But Gassert believes the school disciplining students differently based on who they are attracted to does not similarly qualify. That is especially the case, she says, now that it’s not in the Honor Code.

“If you gave someone a contract and then introduce a clause and then didn’t have them re-sign it, that would be illegal,” she said.

Madi Hawes, a BYU sophomore who is bisexual and uses she/they pronouns, said the investigation reminds her of when the LDS Church was being criticized for not allowing Black men to hold the priesthood. That was changed with a revelation by leaders of the faith in 1978 after immense public pressure.

As a student of color, Hawes hopes the new investigation could lead to change at BYU for the LGBTQ community, another marginalized group.

Hawes also questions BYU’s strict policy against LGBTQ students expressing any romantic feelings physically, when the church’s manual on same-sex attraction doesn’t seem to require the same.

Instead, the faith’s instructions focus on “sexual purity” for everyone, those who are heterosexual or LGBTQ. Its guidance says: “Sexual relations between a man and woman who are not married, or between people of the same sex, violate one of our Father in Heaven’s most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress.”

That accords with the law of chastity of the faith, which Hawes believes is reasonable to ask students at BYU to follow. But the guidelines don’t mention anything about LGBTQ people not kissing or holding hands. She believes the school, in disciplining LGBTQ students for those actions, is not acting in accordance with the faith and the faith’s religious exemptions for education shouldn’t then apply.

Cal Burke, a recent BYU student who is gay, added that he’s disappointed the school is framing its stance as one of religious freedom. He sees it as clear discrimination.

“Even if queer students believe the gospel and keep the rules, BYU will not protect them,” he said. “I am a believer, and I did everything right, and BYU still abandoned me when push came to shove.”

Last year, a professor publicly called Burke a Book of Mormon term associated with an anti-Christ. The school declined to say whether it would take action against the professor. Burke believes that goes against the school’s own policy, with the Honor Code requiring that faculty and students “respect others, including the avoidance of profane and vulgar language.”

He feels BYU picks and chooses what it wants to enforce, creating an environment that’s particularly difficult for LGBTQ students who don’t know if they’ll be turned in for something minor.”",103.0,-lonely_rose-,hti2rej,"When I got let go because I was honest with my bishop about my sexual activity and thus out of college I went into the military to make things work financially. Well the military has a different set of social skills than most LDS homes raise you to understand. So it was challenging and I was the perfect prey.  I wish I could have just stayed in environments I understood socially but the HCO is the HCO and I did agree…

Just last year when a BYU law student decided to have premarital sex with me (and also be the likely source of an STD I then got) I said he should be tested in addition to knocking it off with the social media virtue signaling. He blocked me but being Lds…we have mutual friends from across the LDS community. I can see anything he posts from mutual friends who know what a hypocrit he is. No I don’t like being a nark. But why is it ok for him to lie to his bishop and the HCO and get rewarded by staying… whereas I was honest and got punished? Rewarded for lying? That’s the new HCO way. 🤷‍♀️ Well he really loved telling everyone else to step it up spiritually and was being mean frankly. So I did nark on him to the  HCO. If that’s his standard he could have it. I just want to know why he is still there not missing a beat while it seems other students got the boot because their partner was the same gender. I wonder if the investigating team knows that happened? Why do some students get one punishment and then others get a free pass? Maybe it’s time they make the honor code about personal honor and not systematic discipline. 

I should have never been kicked out of BYU for being honest. If someone is found committing their own “sin” they should get the same understanding and forgiveness that wealthy law student is getting. There is a lot of room for improvement at BYU. BYU deserves some constructive criticism. It’s sad they need to get it from the fed vs. being the example for the nation but that’s one example of why this is happening.",36.0,FreeTapir,htho2wh,">University spokesperson Carri Jenkins said in a statement that she believes the federal office will find BYU is properly exempt and within its rights to enforce the church’s policies against same-sex relationships.

I believe this. The church takes *extreme* care in making sure that they follow the letter of the law. Even with laws that most people don't know exist.

Private property owners are well within their rights to do this.

It's not my fault God called me to be an Assistant President. I'm of a different breed among mankind. Sue me. 

Last week, I was speaking to an old companion over the phone in my mission language. As I masterfully wove the most beautiful vocal tapestry in the Spanish language (that's right, I served overseas), I couldn't help but notice the drooling daughters of God that surrounded me. One of them tried to approach me, but I fended her off with the power of the spirit. After a few minutes, she finally realized that I didn't want to copulate against the glass walls of the Garden Court, and I was able to get back to my daily language study. 

In my classes, I know I'm different from everyone else. As they tell stories from their missions, I can't help but feel bad for them. They don't know what it was like to be an Assistant President. One of the guys in my Eternal Families class (easy for someone like me) tried to tell me that AP stands for ""Assistant to the President"", but I could tell he was just jealous of me. When the ladies have to pick between me and him, he knows who they will run to. 

It's just tiring to know that every time I step out of the house, I'm going to bombarded with marriage proposals and Facebook friend requests. Normal former missionaries just don't understand what it's like to live with a burden like this. Sometimes I resent my strong spirit and perfect knowledge of the scriptures. There's a reason my bishop asks me not to bear my testimony on fast Sunday. We both know that the average young woman wouldn't be able to keep her panties dry listening to me recite the First Vision from memory.

Not owning rainbow attire, I responded with a rainbow emoji to show her, personally, as an individual who has an actual human relationship with her, that she is loved. That's my way of showing ""support."" But I do not feel comfortable parading around campus with rainbow in support of the larger LGBTQ+ community. (Primarily because I don't like the multitudinous interpretations the rainbow banner embodies. It's too loud of a symbol for me to carefully and meaningful communicate my intended message with it in public. I'd rather just decide for myself how to show people love, in ways that make sense to me.)

I'm glad that this day successfully showed some people that they are loved. Truly. However, I can't help but think that those who are concerned for the sake of their fellow man about the loosening of moral standards of society struggle to speak, in fear of receiving hate.

I saw a post on Instagram saying repeatedly that ""support is support"", basically implying that if you're not comfortable waving a rainbow banner around, marching in lockstep with everything that is mainstream, it's because you're not keeping your covenants to love others. (i.e. you are a hateful or ignorant person) The false dichotomy frustrates me deeply.

I guess it just feels unfair that people aren't even willing to have a conversation about how ""support"" can be legitimately defined in this context. Or the fact that two moderately ""loving"" people can respectfully disagree about what it means to ""support"" the LGBTQ+ community. Did the prophet Noah show ""support"" to the people of his day when he preached repentance and warned of the flood? Isn't that the greatest expression of God's love?? Jesus atoned for our sins so that we could repent and be \*\*clean\*\* AND so that he could succor us in our weakness. It's great that he knows how hard life is for LGBTQ+ people, but the fact is life is hard for everyone, and the need to repent isn't magically waived just because ""it hurts"". Every stinkin' last one of us needs to repent and align ourselves with God's will. It breaks my heart that people leave Jesus and the church and turn into straight up atheists because of the culture (that is thankfully being challenged by things like Rainbow Day) that they aren't welcome because they're gay. (Or for any other reason.)

On the other hand, the stupid flyers that showed rainbow raindrops being deflected by an umbrella ""in defense of the Family Proclamation"" is anything but loving and inclusive of people who are struggling to feel God's love and the love of others. Maybe the people who made those flyers genuinely (erroneously) thought that Rainbow Day was an affront on God's revealed order of marriage between man and woman. But to those with half a brain, Rainbow Day is about showing LGBTQ+ people that society doesn't hate them, especially within the Church. Do the people at Deznat really think that telling ""apostates"" to ""go to hell"" will be taken as an invitation to ""come unto Christ""?

I definitely think the Family Proclamation needs to be defended, but I also think it's possible to do so without trampling on the broken hearts of our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters. Some of you might think I'm ""missing the point"" by even bringing up the fact that, yes, the Family Proclamation needs to be defended, but frankly no one can tell me what ""the point is"" when I live in this world, too, and things affect me personally. I'll decide for myself what ""the point is"", thank you very much.

All of this said, in my heart of hearts, I genuinely hope God would be anything but supportive of me if I chose to ignore his commandments. I strive to be supportive of people (LGBTQ+ and otherwise) in their efforts to improve upon their mortal probation and come unto Christ, because in my mind, there is no better way to support a fellow child of God, for that is how I truly see others.

The committee on race made, along with their other recommendations, a recommendation to review campus policies which may disproportionately affect people of different races. This plays into removing the beard rule for two reasons: 

1) pseudofolliculitis, the primary reason you can qualify for a beard card, primarily affects black people (upwards of 60% of black men according to a brief internet search), meaning they have to go through the painful process of getting a beard card at much higher rates (and they have to pay for it).

2) some races have thicker facial hair than others. I'm of Irish/English descent, and when I shave it takes around two days for my 5 o'clock shadow to really become noticeable due to my light hair color. On the other hand, I have friends of Italian/Middle Eastern descent who have super thick, coarse, dark facial hair. They would look like they haven't shaved for 3 days if they waxed their face.

First of all I've done this previously now and if you are like most rookies you will NOT make the money they tell you, you will make. Remember these guys are salesman and will really persuade you to give it a try and not listen to others who are viewing as a negative experience.




The way it works is you sell pest control contracts d2d (door to door) they are usually for 1-year and will average a contract value of for example $520. You as a salesman will get a % and usually they start rookies out at 25% (which is terrible by the way) so that's $130 in commissions per sale you will make. The recruiter will sell you this idea you can make $20,000, $40,000, $100,000 in one summer. **Reality is 99% will NOT.** It's a very hard industry you are knocking door to door 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.



Now that I get out of the way how it works, Let me show you the realty of it and not only MY experience but experience with other friends and coworkers and how we all get screwed and YOU will too.



So they will most likely give you a % of 25%, 30% or maybe even a little higher. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't sell and service over 100 accounts or sometimes even 150 accounts you will get a low flat percentage of 18%. This will cost you thousands of dollars. For example if you go out and work your butt off and you finish the summer with 95 accounts serviced. ($520x95accounts = $49,400(18%) you are only making $8,892 this is not including rent, groceries, gas, entertainment, etc. so you will make a LOT less than you would staying home with your parents working for $8-$15/hour. Since they prey on college students or returned missionaries from the LDS church.That is ONLY ONE WAY they will try and screw you over.



Another way is if you do happen to go against their favor and you do service over 100 or 150 accounts I've had friends I worked with who didn't even get their commission checks. So the way it works is during the summer you will get only $50 upfront for each serviced accounts and the rest of the commission you will get in the ""backend"" (rest of commission checks later in the year, 2 of them) which usually payout a few months later in November, and January. I've had friends who are out there busting all hot summer for 3-4 months to end up not getting anything. There recruiter will lie and say some of there accounts canceled and it fell below the 150 or 100 accounts serviced. To put in perspective let's say you sold and serviced 150 accounts and you get your $50 for each one ($50x150= $7,500 during the summer) with expectations you are going to get a $15,900 after the summer only to come to find out your recruiter kept all your money then will lie to you that some of your accounts weren't legit or they canceled. Keeping $15,900 of your earned money.

**I had a friend who sold and serviced 198 accounts..** and signed a 35% commission plan, which would of been like $36,000+ he would made (since I don't remember his average contract value) **he ended making only $9,900** ($50 upfront per sale x 198accounts = $9,900) and his recruiter would end up keeping $41,100+ (I figured this since if he only got paid it $9,900 that would be only 10% since he didn't get his backend checks. Since the recruiter can recruit someone and give them a commission deal the recruiter will make the difference of 50%, for example 50%-10%(whatever number they sign a recruit at) = 40% recruiter keeps) we will say he averaged a contract value of $520 x 198accounts = $102,960 revenue (40% recruiter keeps if they screw you over) Recruiter keeps $41,000 and this is how they make their money my screwing over multiple recruits and obviously wanting a couple of them to succeed because they will make override commissions of that recruit but also any recruits they bring on to the team the following summers, almost like a pyramid.


**DON'T sell door-to-door pest control**, 99% of the time they will screw you over. They are not in the industry to make it into a career, they are in it to recruit and have unexperienced and uneducated first year reps make their money year after year. Please spread the word and share this post with people who are thinking about doing it. This is how your recruiter is able to afford all the stuff they are showing off to you. (cars, trucks, clothes, gadgets, toys, lifestyle, travelling, etc.) You will be working 12 hour days, 6 days a week to make money for their pockets and since you're a 1099 ""employee"" that signed some pathetic agreement they can get away with this. You should really avoid any sales recruiter If you have any questions comment below or message me. I got screenshots of my previous agreement commission plan and screenshots how I got screwed over and I sold over the 150 amount.  


If you have any experiences similar or know of anyone who this happened to post below. Let's make it aware for others before going out and wasting their summer since some of us have tuition bills to pay, families to support, etc.

**To add:** Aptive and it’s recruiters/team leaders really do be trying to set you up for failure or set the odds against you however you want to look at it. Because they have control on what they put down on the agreement you sign for example.

- 18% if you don’t service over 150 accounts
- 18% if you switch to a technician (but in reality you won’t get any of it)
- they keep ALL your money if you leave home early (over 60% of reps do)
- if you don’t service a minimum of 6 accounts/week you will get written up then fired if it happens again, resulting in your recruiter keeping ALL your money (recruiters will say this is in both our best interest because we don’t want you to be out here if you’re not selling, but just imagine if you have to take a few days off for a wedding or you get sick.. lol)
- if you go home even a day early from the dates you told them on paper, written you are voiding your contract and they can keep all your money. Even if they say “talk to us and we’re understanding” don’t believe it, only what’s in writing actually is true. Had it happen to a buddy who went home only 2 days early from his end date and kept ALL his money..

My name is Tanner Bennett, I’m a 24 year old student and I’m running for Provo City Council! 

I’m extremely excited for this opportunity to participate in the democratic process, and wanted to tell you a bit about myself, my campaign, and why I’m running. 

Link to socials: [https://linktr.ee/bfp2023](https://linktr.ee/bfp2023)

# About me:

I’m a full-time student at BYU studying political science and Mandarin. I’ve spent my whole time at BYU studying about politics and the political process and felt compelled to try and participate when the opportunity presented itself. 

I am a global sales executive at a company in pleasant grove and have an extensive work history/background in building, working for, and running nonprofits. 

# Why I’m running: 

Provo is Utah’s 4th largest municipality with about 115,000 residents, 40% of which are age 18-25 with most attending BYU, UVU or one of the other colleges/technical schools located nearby. This 40% of Provo’s population has been repeatedly shafted by our City Council and major concerns of this population are completely ignored. Why is that? Frankly, **students don’t vote**. When I asked incumbents why they don’t campaign to or talk with college students it’s because we are not engaged. This is for several reasons that range from how busy we are in this stage of life, to complete apathy for government and I completely understand it.

**However, I want to change that but I need your help.**

I’m running as a moderate independent, trying to be a voice for Provo’s silent 40% on both sides of the aisle. This means that I care about:

1. Living within a budget (but also setting a budget that realistically can achieve what provo actually needs)
2. Acting as a voice for renters against abusive/manipulative landlords and providing concrete reporting methods and fines against landlords that refuse to resolve major issues for their tenants. 
3. Promoting active transportation and increasing Provo’s walk/bike/scooter friendliness.
4. Increase the level of shuttling and public transport offered for areas further from the universities
5. Continuing to fund, maintain, and improve Provo's trails, biking paths, and conservation/sustainability efforts! (Also improving our leash laws and improving their control/implementation-- nearly been bitten a bit too much!).
6. Improving the parking situation all over Provo while focusing on increasing our greenspaces.
7. Working to further improve the level of inclusivity for members of the LGBTQ+ community in Provo.
8. Focusing in on developing sustainable housing solutions for Provo’s growing unhoused population.
9. Attracting more businesses to Provo and helping our current businesses to continue to grow and develop.
10. With more to come!

People seem to hate that I'm running on a ""moderate independent"" platform, but at the same time hyperpartisanship is preventing us from achieving solutions that work, are cost-effective, and are based in science and research. According to Gallup research, 37% of Americans identify as moderate, more than conservatives (36%) and more than liberal (27%). I'm hoping to bring both sides closer to the middle and actually work to get things done.

# My campaign: 

I’m running a **$0 campaign** which means I am not seeking donations and I’m not spending any money beyond what was required to register. This means I’m not spending money on: 

* signage
* hand bills
* advertisements
* campaign managers
* etc.

What I *am* doing is trying to use social media to educate, promote, and share about the importance of civic engagement and trying to get the 40% people who for sure live in Provo 3/4ths of the year to register here and vote for someone who actually cares about them and their needs. I know what it’s like being a college-age student in Provo because I am one! In office, I hope that I can keep this platform up to share updates and news in a way similar to how Rep. Jeff Jackson has been doing, I think this kind of campaigning and communication is the future.

If you’ve read this long and this sounds like something you would support, I ask that you please take the time to like (or upvote), follow my social media accounts and help share my message! Together we can keep money out of politics and do a lot of good for Provo!  

Even if I’m not the person for you, I sincerely hope you’ll register and take the time to find someone who you do want to vote for! In municipal elections, your vote matters more than in any other.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hope that if you have questions you will reach out! Thanks again!

Students generally don't own property, pay local taxes, have kids in local school districts, and are there for a few years. Also, many students are only registered to vote at their permanent address (typically wherever their parents live).

However, going to the BYU Baylor game last night reminded me of what makes BYU great—I believe that \*most\* BYU fans, at their core, are kind (if imperfect) people who want to make the world a better place. 

There were so many things to love about last night—the enthusiasm in the stadium was insane, and I sat by a bunch of Baylor fans who told me that we were the nicest fanbase they've ever interacted with (which is so good to hear!)

The best part of the night, though, was at the very end, when Jaren Hall walked over to Jake Oldroyd, who was bawling his eyes out, and gave him a huge hug.

For context, Oldroyd had missed two field goals (one at the end of regulation, one in the first overtime) that would have won us the game. I'm sure he was absolutely devastated as we headed into the second overtime. That kind of mistake can weigh heavily on a player. 

When we won the game, you could tell Oldroyd was absolutely relieved. Jaren Hall walked over to him and held him. What a stellar leader and teammate!

Although BYU fans aren't perfect and we definitely have lots of room for change and growth, I also believe that my time at BYU taught me how to be a better person, leader, and friend.

Taking more than 15 credits in your first semester is probably a BAD IDEA. 

Especially if you are taking notoriously difficult classes, i.e. econ 110, chem 105 

I graduated high school as valedictorian with a 4.0 gpa and 11 AP classes under my belt. My first semester, I took 16 credits. I didn't have a job. I got a 2.9 GPA that semester and lost my scholarship at the end of the year. Plus I changed my major two years later so I really wasted my time.

You have at least 3-4 years ahead of you. There's no rush! Take 12-14 credits and give yourself time to adjust. Replace a hard class with a lecture series or two. for many freshmen, this will be your first time living away from home, which is a huge adjustment by itself.

Also, IMO, AP classes do not really prepare you for a college class. Most high school teachers don't implement the same structure and format that you will see in a college class. My AP classes gave me false confidence in my college abilities.

Squeezing in 1-2 extra classes is NOT worth starting your college career with a low gpa. Especially if you have a scholarship with gpa requirements! Prioritize that scholarship. 

TL;DR: Be humbler than I was, take less than 15 credits, build a solid gpa, give yourself some time to adjust to BYU.",jnpme12,This.

Select leaders of the Church (oddly enough, the ones who have served as presidents of the university in the past) seem very concerned with the trajectory of BYU, and I can't really seem to understand why. Elder Holland's speech to the faculty of BYU last year seemed to trigger this culture of concern, and it seems to have stuck around pretty strongly since. I feel like BYU is simply just shifting the way we build our communities and treat and understand marginalized groups. Certainly there are students at BYU who are antagonistic toward the Church in general, but they seem to be a very vocal minority--I feel like the majority of students who are hurt by these kinds of teachings are not these, but are those who love the Church and the gospel but are navigating how to be more open-minded toward different viewpoints, perspectives, and backgrounds. Speeches like President Oaks' feel a bit divisive to me because it conveys this idea that we all have to think the same, act the same, look the same, and be essentially a monolith structured by Church leaders, and I simply don't agree with that notion. I also feel like that black-and-white approach is harmful and more faith-destructing than faith-promoting, because it teaches people that if they have doubts, questions, or concerns, that they should just leave BYU/the Church instead of wrestling with them and seeking to gain ""further light and knowledge."" In my opinion, some of the fence-sitters in the Church are genuinely good people just seeking to build a testimony on truth rather than tradition and they are having a hard time because leaders are rushing them in their process of receiving answers to their desperate questions and prayers. It's doing more harm than good, in my opinion.

I wasn't seeking to be offended by the devotional, and I don't feel that I was, just trying to grapple with why this topic felt ""priority"" and the point President Oaks was really trying to make. I don't see the ""destruction"" of BYU's uniqueness as a priority in my book when there are members of the Church literally killing themselves because they feel like they don't belong in their wards, communities, college campuses, etc. I just came away from this feeling like there is an imbalance in priorities among a few of the leaders. I think they're doing their best to tackle difficult subjects in today's world, but sometimes the execution just doesn't resonate with me. I'd love to hear what you guys thought--I'm curious to see if anyone felt similarly, or if anyone interpreted this speech differently.",iocm6ya,"I disagree with how you interpret President Oaks point. He isn't asking that people be or act the same, nor is he implying that BYU should have a universal political view point.

I think he is urging students to leave political and or ideological differences aside and love first. Is BYU a university of activists or is it a university of children of God. I have no problem with people who do both, but maybe one is more important and unifying. 

I also worry about BYU's trajectory. It seems some want to secularize the school while also retaining the Church sponsorship, which seems contradictory. I may get downvoted to oblivion for saying this, but I think BYU should remain religious and the students should put Christ-like love for each other before political activism. Because religion doesn't address politics the same way politics doesn't address religion. (For those of you who disagree just know that the apostles are all over the political spectrum)",58.0,Theoreticallyaaron,iocug41,"I agree with a lot of your thoughts. Certain leaders seem to be oblivious to the fact that certain language and statements end up adding fuel to the fire for certain extremists.  This can create further division.

If that is truly the case, then call them out and shed light on them so everyone can know clearly where the lines need to be drawn. Vague references and repeating platitudes aren't that helpful. I am of the opinion that Church leadership should try to rise above the fray of political arguments and fabricated culture wars and focus on drawing us closer to Christ. While I can sympathize with their end goal  and I don't envy their position, I agree that the execution leaves a lot to be desired.",57.0,thoughtfulsaint,iofvj8i,"I'm a former BYU student (undergrad and masters) who came to grips with my honest agnostic atheism while at BYU (and on my mission).

I have a lot of warm feelings towards BYU, honestly. BYU's focus on undergrad education is exemplary. I am at another university now which is *not* as focused on undergrad education, and it shows. I always had (with few exceptions) great professors, who have affected my life for the better.

While I struggle with seeing BYU push to make the university more ""orthodox"", I think the church is perfectly within its rights to do so. Within the orthodox framework, it seems to make sense. If the LDS church really does hold the ""keys of salvation"", and if it is fully incumbent on church members to be *maximally* devoted to the church, then making BYU be more deeply orthodox and church-focused is sensible. If it is true that there are adversarial/wordly forces that are trying to bring people in the church down, then policing boundaries between the secular and the spiritual seems to be the only option.

My grief, then, is because I *don't* think the LDS Church (or anyone) holds keys to salvation, and I don't think there is an adversary who is looking to drag people into misery. I think the world just... is. There are ""worldly"" things that I think *are* harmful, and worth pushing back against. But, I don't share the LDS theological framework for justifying these beliefs.

Perhaps more centrally: I think I was a *good* member of the BYU community, even while I was privately planning on stepping away from the church. I gave liberally of my time and talents to help math students learn and grow. I was a friend to those in need. I was not perfect, by any stretch. But, I feel like I could still fit in by just doing my part to help others, even though my religious beliefs were different. It makes me sad to see BYU move in a direction that would have made it less likely (or impossible) for me to be a member of the community and also honest about my beliefs. I don't feel like my contributions to the BYU community were thwarted by my personal non-belief. If anything, that only lead me to re-focus my attention on the meaningful things I still share with LDS church members.",22.0,hjrrockies

A family member of mine was a straight-A student in high school who attended BYU on an academic scholarship. She figured her future husband would be the breadwinner, so she majored in something useless and irrelevant (humanities, I think?) 

After graduating, she married some guy and just had a kid with him. Right after she found of she was pregnant, her husband got laid off. He is still looking for a job, and in the meantime, the best she can do is work...retail. That's right, our former honor student with her fancy BYU degree is working alongside high school kids earning poverty wages. She graduated from college with no marketable skills, so thus far only retail will hire her.

I've seen this happen over and over and over again: academically-talented young women who put all their eggs in the homemaker basket and then get a rude awakening when they get divorced, widowed, their husband loses his job, or they never find a husband in the first place. I recently brought this up in in last week's Gospel Doctrine class (we were discussing the principle of self-reliance) and literally every person in the room had a similar story from their friend circle.

I think it's great that BYU and the Church extol the preeminence of motherhood and I'm *not* dissing SAHMs, but you must be prepared to take on the role of breadwinner should the need arise and earlier you can develop those skills or earn those credentials, the better off you'll be. ",lfcoky1,"This is great advice, but I think it applies to all women and not just those that or college bound or even just BYU bound. I get why you posted in this sub though. Everyone needs marketable skills beyond those needed for retail, fast food, and hospitality.",75.0,Masverde66,lfcik3l,"I mean, humanities degree =/= ""useless and irrelevant."" Your friend's situation is unfortunate, but don't conflate naiveté with the inherent value of an entire college.

Yes, STEM majors often find jobs in their field but the humanities adds value to many fields. Someone who majored in humanities is often a better persuasive writer and can parlay that into being successful in a business workplace. Creative degrees can also provide able problem solvers, project managers, and innovators but it is all about how you sell yourself. My college roommate got a degree in English and people always asked him what he was going to do with that degree. His Answer was, “to be educated.” He works happily as a bike mechanic and earns enough to live comfortably with his family but it was his education that gave him confidence to get the job he has. 

Perhaps what we need more is to emphasize to any getting a degree to take the capstone careers in your field class to learn both how to market yourself and what options you have. 

Finally for anyone finding themselves unemployed despite a degree consider attending your Ward or Stake Self Reliance Class on employment. Learning to how to create a resume and to be confident in interviews is something anyone can benefit from. 

Finally remember that in the work world women not matter their education are at a disadvantage and in Utah more so as there is a lot of systematic hostility to a woman being anything but a homemaker or in the service industry. In Utah too the assumption is that those high paying jobs need to go to a man because he’s the one who needs to support a family and somehow a woman taking that work would be wrong. Additionally businesses across the globe also see women as a liability because if they get pregnant then the investment in that employee is down the drain and she may never come back to work. Things need to change direction sure but this is why so many SAHM end up getting into things like Doterra or Amway or Mary Kay to make ends meet because that has become socially acceptable. 

So for female students. Learn how to market yourself and build confidence but do something you can be passionate about not just something that makes money. That passion can help you open doors as you exhibit confidence as you enter the career field. Best of luck as you navigate the future.",26.0,eltraveso

The invitation to replace “the church” with “Jesus Christ” anytime we have concerns or questions is a thought-stopping and theologically flawed approach. We know from history the church has been wrong so what’s up with this teaching becoming so pervasive nowadays? 

Additionally, stating that people aren’t truly following Christ unless they’re doing it through the Church is just so weird when we simultaneously acknowledge the validity of other denominational Christians, and many of my current friends continue to believe in and follow Christ independent of the church because of bad experiences they’ve had. We need to honor that instead of judging it.

I would like to add that the title of the devotional is, ""Why a Church?"" This is a fantastic, interesting premise for a devotional. I was very excited for this speech when I attended on Tuesday.

But the answer the speaker gives is not satisfactory. It starts well, explaining that being a regular part of a church can help us connect with God more than worshipping without one. But after that, it seems he forgets what kind of person is asking this question. Instead of helping people to realize what a church can do for them, he castigates them for even thinking that the church might have flaws. That's not helpful.

I find great fault with this speaker's proposal that we replace ""the church"" with ""Jesus Christ"" in our concerns about our church. It's not that I question whether church leaders are invested in divine authority. It's just that I know that the church, the institution itself, run by men, has done bad things with terrible justifications that [it no longer accepts](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng). By asking us to replace ""the church"" with ""Jesus Christ"" in all our criticisms and concerns, **this speaker is asking us not to blame humanity for our sins, but to blame God**. This idea, to my mind, verges on blasphemy, and I can only accept it from this speaker because I do not think he understands what he is saying.

Maybe it's always been that way, maybe I'm just noticing it more at this point in my life. Anything but blind loyalty to the Church leadership is viewed as apostasy. To me it looks like a bunch of fallible, mortal men trying to hide behind a facade of divine power. People who want a strong central leadership may be drawn to that, but it's turned away people like me who want transparency from leadership. 

Any concerns about Church leadership is eventually met with ""if you had enough faith then these things wouldn't matter."" Not only is that dismissive, but it's manipulative and abusive. Cult-like. 

My individual concerns have no way of affecting Church leadership anyway, it's not like they have any direct accountability to the membership and the membership has no way of enforcing accountability. So my doubts and concerns don't even really matter in the grand scheme of things. But I'm not allowed to voice my individual concerns according to Church culture, because my voice may lead other people away. So instead of addressing concerns, Church culture just instead seeks to quash all concerns at the source and prevent any kind of collective idea or group that goes against leadership. It's an authoritarian hellhole. Conform or you're going to hell.

And I just know a bunch of ""defenders of the faith"" are going to respond to this post and point how I'm wrong and the Church is great and the faithful are chosen to defend against evil, etc. Those are the type of people who love the authoritarianism in the Church.

I know, feel free to burn me alive. I worked my tail off to try to change this about print and mail. A few things made this hard:

The supervisor of my supervisor was cheap. They didn’t buy us new printers often and had us (n00bz) repair old ones and try them out before getting new ones. And often the new ones came from BYU surplus used and we still had to repair them. 

There are 4 people on the team and they’re in charge of all tech support for the BYU Print and Mail building PLUS these printers PLUS most of the print service desks located on campus. It’s a hellish workload.

Printers literally suck as a technology. It’s a cliche in movies to have issues with thw office printer because they seriously just SUCK. 

BYU has a contract for harder repairs, troubleshooting, and maintenance to be done by a KonicaMinolta tech who has to travel through all of southern and central Utah. They won’t give us another tech because we don’t own enough printers or something (I can’t really remember why, it’s been five years). 

Rest assured though, that I tried so hard to fix these problems. I streamlined our ticketing system, made submitting student tickets possible, threw out a ton of old print stations nobody used to decrease our load, and vouched for putting brand new printers in. I spent a summer troubleshooting problems with those new printers and there were STILL issues with them once the semester started. Printers seriously SUCK and so do idiot students like me with only on the job training.

I still shake my fist when I go to print and end up wandering through three buildings to find one that works. Some of those printers are absolutely haunted.

11qd7ee,Office of Belonging to no longer service LGBTQ+ students?,90,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/11qd7ee/office_of_belonging_to_no_longer_service_lgbtq/,87,2023-03-13 15:46:14+00:00,FailingMyBest,"So I was chatting with one of my professors last week and apparently the Office of Belonging from here on out will only be providing services for racial/ethnic minority students and disabled students. Additionally, they sent this invite out to faculty to pass along to their “LGBTQ+ students” (as if professors are supposed to just know who is queer and who isn’t, because if you’re not out you’re apparently not queer) for an activity in the Wilk and the invite originally didn’t have the location of the gathering; you had to contact Women’s Services to get the room number. My professor chose to add it on regardless. 

How is Women’s Services an appropriate organization to house LGBTQ+ efforts on campus? How are queer issues strictly women’s issues? This is just so bizarre and sad to me. LGBTQ+ are by far the most mistreated students on campus and to not allow them a space in an office designed to integrate belonging is just cruel. And to advertise LGBTQ+ events intentionally without a room number to gatekeep the event and (presumably) require potentially closeted students to reach out first to get the location makes me super weary. This is why I am not out at BYU and probably never will be. 

I had high hopes for this office, but it seems to be turning out to be just another disappointing, virtue signaling pick-and-choose fest. Anyone know anyone who works at the office of belonging or has more insight on what on earth is going on here? I’d love another perspective if I’m getting it wrong here, but from what I’ve been told I can’t help but feel like the university is yet again signaling that it doesn’t care about its queer population.

Edit: here is insider information provided below from someone who talked with an employee in the office: 

“Here’s what I’ve learned today from a member of the Office of Belonging…

-- Any student who wants to talk with someone at the Office of Belonging is absolutely welcome and encouraged to come in, including LGBTQ+ students. Students who have experienced any form of discrimination can make their reports through in the Office of Belonging.

-- The Office of Belonging wants LGBTQ students, along with students from other demographics, to participate on student councils, in focus groups, as student employees/researchers, and on panels. If any student is interested in becoming involved with these projects, they’re encouraged to reach out to the Office of Belonging.

-- The Office of Belonging will be involved in developing education and training for employees and students. The experience of LGBTQ students is an important consideration in the curriculum.

-- Rather than having just one place for LGBTQ students to find support, the Office of Belonging would love to consult with any department who is interested in creating more welcoming environments for LGBTQ students.

-- Independent Office of Belonging events will be for the entire campus community rather than specific groups (Belonging Begins with Me, etc). Any demographic-specific events will be cosponsored with other departments. Ex- The Office of Belonging will not independently organize an event for students with disabilities but would consider co-sponsoring an event organized by the University Accessibility Center.”",jc2htyc,"In before, ""you knew the rules and signed the honor code, blah blah blah, don't like it, leave and go to the U"". :)

While increased media attention and sustained critiques regarding conservative stances on social issues have caused a PR nightmare for BYU's administration, one less acknowledged point of secular judgment stems from BYU's rigid and seemingly arbitrary enforcement of the beard ban.

While the beard ban once served the purpose of discouraging anti-authoritarian protests in the 60s and 70s, nowadays the meaning of the beard ban has faded into obscurity. Instead of serving any apparent social cause, the beard ban seems to be enforced as a matter of tradition. Although beards have no negative connotation in contemporary society (indeed, they may have a positive connotation), BYU has continued to enforce the ban as a matter of principle.

While it is entirely within BYU's rights to enforce such a ban, I suspect that by doing so, they inadvertently cast a bad light on the University as well as its sponsoring organization the LDS church. To outsiders, the continued enforcement of a 1960's dress code seems to denote a spirit of rigidity and inflexibility that permeates BYU's administration. The inability of BYU's policy to update to better accommodate contemporary social norms and grooming trends reeks of arbitrarity and dogmatism.

As the outward-facing academic institution of the LDS Church, the beard ban raises questions regarding the Church's ability to cope with similar trends on a global scale. That is, can the Church adapt and grow to meet the needs of a new generation, or, like BYU, will it stay rooted in arbitrary traditions and dogmatisms that have arisen from a previous time? If the beard ban were rooted in LDS theology, then I suspect there would be good grounds for maintaining a beard ban on campus. But, given that the original justifications for the ban have faded into obsolescence, all that remains is a shadow of BYU's (and possibly the LDS Church's) resistance to change, commitment to another generation's social norms, and a failure to update to the current needs of the modern world.",ikq0iz0,"Every time this comes up, the reaction is always the same. Everyone here is right there with you. No one likes the beard ban.

Thing is, we're not the ones to convince. You've gotta convince the ones who actually have the power to make the decision.",88.0,Sw429,ikqtlc9,"I suspect the beard policy could be quickly changed if a large enough segment of the student body simply refused to shave. Unlike other unpopular policies, there's no doctrinal basis for it. 1000 students standing in line at the testing center during finals being denied tests would force the administration to either cave, or make a lot of unpopular headlines. But like most campaigns of this nature, it comes down to a game of chicken. They can ignore 100 people, but not 10,000. Once the movement hit a critical mass, it would win.

The problem, of course, is getting that critical mass. I think the reason such a trivial issue hasn't come to a head until now is exactly that it is so trivial. We all recognize that the policy is ridiculous, but it's trivial enough that it's not really worth risking all that much to protest. LGBTQ issues are far more worthy of protest, but also a much harder hill to climb.

For my part, I haven't been clean shaven in 15 years. If I ever become a billionaire I'll offer them some money contingent on ending the beard ban. Short of that, I don't know what I can do.

So the Church Newsroom just published this today, and sent an email out to all of us students notifying us of these changes. It's been posted in other parts of this sub, but I have to post here to add my own thoughts as an active member of the church and a current BYU student.

Dress & grooming standards doubled down on the beard ban, so no flexibility there. BYU-I students can wear shorts now (which I would hardly call progress) due to the alignment of dress and grooming standards across all CES institutions.

Honor Code doubled down on LGBTQ+ students and same-sex romantic behavior.

**Worst of all:** in order to be endorsed to attend BYU, students must do more than simply follow Honor Code standards; they are **now expected to answer questions mirroring all of the temple recommend interview questions to the satisfaction of their local leader in order to retain their academic standing at BYU.**

I have friends here who struggle with Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, aspects of church history, sustaining church leadership, paying tithing, being temple worthy, and a variety of other things. This change has absolutely told those students that they don't belong here. If you can't profess faith in these things, and prove to your bishop that you have a testimony of them, you're out.

The church is a so-called place for sinners, but I guess BYU is not. I am *furious* about this. I hope people understand just how much this will damage students and professors alike. What an absolute failure on behalf of the Church Educational Board for making these changes.

They just effectively gave the boot to more than half of my friends at BYU.",jxmazdk,">I have friends here who struggle with Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, aspects of church history, sustaining church leadership, paying tithing, being temple worthy, and a variety of other things.

""Strive"" is a very important word here. Nothing says you can't have doubts or questions about these things. The question is, how are you responding to those doubts and questions? If you're not sure but are still trying to figure things out, I interpret ""strive"" as meaning there's still a place for you.

xfvp6h,Why was I never told that BYU used electro-shock therapy on gay students?,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/xfvp6h/why_was_i_never_told_that_byu_used_electroshock/,183,2022-09-16 16:18:50+00:00,Low_Secret_1126,"I am a recent BYU alumni. I come from a family of die-hard BYU fans and mostly active members of the church. I, myself, am in the middle of a faith transition and as a result, am diving deeper than ever into the history, good and bad, of the church and BYU. I recently came across this information that shocked and appalled me. 

BYU approved and allowed a study in 1976 that essentially gave gay students an ultimatum: either be kicked out of school and face church and familial punishment for being gay, or participate in this “therapy”.

Not only did it traumatize most of the 14 men who went through it, but 2 of them ended up dying by suicide later and others seriously contemplated suicide.

Though this doesn’t make it okay at all, I understand that at the time, there were other “studies” and “gay aversion therapy” practices going on at other universities, yet why would BYU, a school lead, ultimately, by a prophet of God, be a part of such a disgusting thing? 

It makes me so angry that BYU, which should be a school associated with the spirit of love and kindness of Christ, not only allowed this to happen but continues to actively discriminate and tolerate hateful behavior towards LGBTQ students.

Note, as I was researching this, I learned that Dallin Oaks, who was the president of BYU at the time, was asked about this last year during a Q&A at another university but denied that this happened, which is clearly a lie. Why would an apostle blatantly lie?

I’m not looking for excuses about why this might have been accepted at the time or any “hate the sin” garbage. I just want other students to know that this happened because I never did and I want to know why it’s not acknowledged, and even lied about?

So, we may feel betrayed to learn something new and negative about the past, but I'm not sure we can expect them to give us some kind of full past disclosure statement. Transparency is a great value, and I hope Church culture adopts it even more in the future, but that would be an extreme application of it!

When I attended BYU as a Psychology student, I heard of conversion therapy at BYU happening in the past. I was told it was a bad idea, didn't work, was discontinued, and is illegal now. I don't remember where I heard that, and I don't know if my source was complete or even accurate. I found it disturbing to hear about, but I was glad it had been stopped.",62.0,frontierpsychy,iop0ih0,"I'm currently at BYU and I can relate a lot to what you’re saying. A couple of months ago I went through the same process of “awakening.” 

You just realize that things aren’t as you thought they were. Anyway, I’m glad that with the help of my wife and much effort to reconcile my testimony with everything I was discovering about church history, I decided to stay in the church, and now I feel that my testimony grew to be even stronger than before.

The whole situation of President Oaks saying that those “recovery gay therapy” didn't happen when he was president of BYU is so messed up. He straight lied or just got the dates very, very confused. That's just another reminder that prophets and apostles are men subject to bias and weaknesses like we all are. 

Now, I wouldn't say that BYU and the church are hiding this information because if you go to lib.byu.edu you can find all the studies from 1976 explaining the experiments and things they tried. So... Yeah... Super weird and messed up. I agree with you on asking why would the lord allowed these horrendous things to happen in his university.  Whether we like it or not, society has a huge influence on the church, because the church is being guided by mortal people like you and me that live in this world and adopt worldly costumes and practices. And back then, everyone was experimenting with gays :/

Once we learn from this and many other things that happened in church history, it’s normal to feel betrayed and automatically lose trust in the church and its leaders. However, I think we tend to emotionally react to these findings and we make important decisions thinking emotionally. Once we chill out a little bit and sit with that discomfort, we start thinking more rationally. In my case, I came to understand that BYU and the Church won't ever cry out from the roof of the buildings about all the things they did badly. No one does that. Along with that, I appreciated that BYU still has public records of all the studies and experiments with gay students. They could have perfectly deleted everything but they didn't. 

Comparing BYU and the church now with what they were back then, we can see massive improvement.

It just seems like dating has gotten more and more difficult. I'm not shy so I've asked out lots of women, gone on lots of dates as well as been turned down a bunch, but I feel like I've exhausted my usual methods of finding people to date.

I'm a 23M senior in a STEM major, so there are very few women in my classes. Those I have asked have said no. I've tried asking out women from my other classes and have rarely gotten anywhere with that. Ever since I got back from my mission I've gone out as much as possible to try to meet people, like I used to go to club night every week. I don't go as much because it seems like 90% of the women who go to on campus clubs are freshmen. That was fine when I was just back from the mission but now at 23 even thinking about asking out a girl who just graduated high school, even by accident, feels creepy and gross. I go to parties most weekends but they're too loud for conversations. I use Mutual but matches are few and far between and texts back from matches are even more rare.

I've talked to a bunch of people who have had better luck than me and haven't gotten very far. My friends in relationships are either with someone they grew up with or someone who made it obvious they were interested from the beginning. My single friends around my age are either going after freshmen or have given up.

So I'm kinda stuck. Do I just go to the library and walk up to someone cute and start talking? My parents suggested that but it feels like most people in the library are there to study or hanging out with their friends and wouldn't be very receptive to a random guy walking up and striking up a conversation. Is there really anywhere else to go to meet girls closer to my age? Or do I just have to wait until I graduate and move out of Provo?

This is really stressing me out because I'll never have as big of a dating pool as I do here. I have no clue whether I'll be able to get a job here and other YSA wards I've been in outside of Utah are sparse. Being around so many people with what I assume are similar long term goals, but not being able to click with any of them, while seeing things work out for so many others, is getting to be discouraging.",k7kwu2a,"Yeah it isn't easy.

My recommendation from what you have said? Take a breather from it. Step away from it long enough that it no longer stresses you out. Don't give up, but let the stress levels come down before you jump back into it.

I see that username you chose OP",66.0,JohnnyLingo488,k7ksx5k,"You need to find a hobby that is popular with people your age, e.g. pickleball, indoor rock climbing, hiking, etc. Then you go for yourself and get some experience at it, make some friends with people better than you and the opportunity will often arise for you to meet people you're attracted to or that these new friends will introduce you to.

It sucks if you aren't necessarily interested in the things that are popular with adults your age, but often dating is a game that you have to learn to play.

It also helps to get even a part-time job that has a lot of people your age as you will naturally make friends with them and they all hang out anyways. I served at a restaurant all through college and made tons of friends and met tons of people.

Also, if you're only 23, you shouldn't be worried about the age gap of 4 years to 19. That's a you thing imo. Just meeting and chatting with people without being too concerned whether they're 4 years younger or older than you can teach you a lot about people. Everybody's at different stages in their life and leaving the opportunity open is always good advice.",35.0,KURPULIS,k7l38kl,"I’m going to give you advice as an exmormon BYU STEM Alumni, who had very similar struggles while at BYU.  I am now engaged to the love of my life and couldn’t imagine having a better fit for me, but my advice really is applicable whether you’re Mormon or not.

You need to stop feeling like there is an expected timeline for finding your person.  If you are feeling rushed and pressured into dating, that will show in the way you interact with people and you will end up coming off as desperate.  Your 20s are a time of racing around trying to establish yourself and never quite feeling like you are there yet.  Be really honest with yourself and ask yourself what your motivations are for getting married.  Is it because you feel you ought to and you are being driven by the pressure around you?  

I spent so much time trying to date and feeling like I was aging out of the dating pool at BYU.  I tried all the available apps at the time, went to as many social activities as I could and just never felt like I could find anything that worked.  I’m a pretty solid introvert and forcing myself that far out of my comfort zone didn’t make me magically find my person, I’m sure people could tell I was not being fully genuine and that is something that does not help with attracting people.  

I didn’t meet my partner until I was 30 after years of trying the brute force dating method I kind of got exhausted and started trying to understand myself better.  I worked on myself, went to therapy and had to swallow a lot of pride about how I viewed myself and the assumptions I made about other people.  I learned to be ok with the idea of not getting married and this allowed me to be comfortable just being myself.  And you know what?  Thats what my partner was most attracted to.  I had to let go of my ego and that insecurity that made me feel I was incomplete until I was married.

The thing is, I would still say I am incomplete without my partner.  But not because she completed me when we first met.  I was already complete as a person, but as a couple we have grown beyond our individual selves.  No man is an island after all, but that doesn’t mean an island cant have its own healthy ecosystem before it becomes part of the bigger world.

I've been at BYU for the past 6 years earning my BS and MS. I was supposed to continue on and do a PhD, but instead I'm leaving academia to work full-time. Why? Because I lost my faith.

I won't go into details about why I'm leaving the church, but let me assure you it was a painful journey and one that I did not choose. I learned some things that fundamentally changed my understanding of the church, and after a year of praying and studying and hoping I realized I could never go back to feeling the way I once did about Joseph Smith or the current church leadership. I have no hard feelings towards the members I've known and loved throughout my life, but Mormonism just isn't for me anymore.

The hardest part of leaving the church has been deciding to leave BYU, as that has permanantly changed my career trajectory. I would absolutely stay here if I felt like I could. I'd be happy to quietly resign from the church and continue living the honor code, but as per the university's Student Standing Policy ([https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy)) that would disqualify me from an ecclesiastical endorsement. I could fake being active to keep my ecclesiastical endorsement, but I'm not willing to submit myself to that bishop's roulette game any longer than I already have. I feel like I've been forced out of my community because of something outside of my control.

In the past few years I have contributed a lot to this university. I've helped hundreds of students as a TA. I've led research projects that have brought recognition and funding to my department. I've mentored almost every new research assistant that has entered my advisor's lab. I've taught classes and presented published research at conferences. And I would have continued to do the same things for the next three+ years if BYU let me. I believe this school would have been better off with me than without me.

I'm not particularly angry about the situation. I'm going to a great job, and now that I've made my decision I'm excited for the change. But I really feel that by forcing people like me out - people who unwillingly lose their faith - BYU is shooting itself in the foot. Sure, there is a risk that former members might actively detract from the spiritual beliefs of their classmates, but BYU already has other policies in place to prevent that. I hope they reconsider their policy and start treating former church members the same as other non-members. 

The stated goal of the Honor Code is to encourage campus community members to ""conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and...to maintain the highest standards in their personal conduct regarding honor, integrity, morality, and consideration of others"". I believe I can do that outside of the church just as easily as I did it in the church. In fact, it is my honor and integrity that demands I leave the church, and it's my consideration to others that demands I not work to actively lead others out of it.

Limiting parking is one way to be more sustainable and unfortunately it means inconvenience.

nb619a,Does anyone really like the honor code?,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/nb619a/does_anyone_really_like_the_honor_code/,66,2021-05-13 02:16:58+00:00,Rogue_the_Saint,"When I first went through orientation at BYU, I was interested in the way that the honor code was pitched to new students. The presenters said that the honor code first began as a grassroots effort, initiated by the student body, to promote a higher moral standard of conduct amongst the students living on campus. However, as I have progressed through my time at BYU, I am not sure if I have ever encountered any student who particularly likes the honor code. At least every student I've met seems to think that some aspects of the honor code need to be altered if not discarded altogether. 

While the honor code may have represented a grassroots student movement from the class of 1948 (when the honor code was endorsed), it no longer seems to represent the values or opinions of the student body. For that reason, it seems somewhat facetious to pitch the honor code to new students as a body of stipulations that is presently accepted by the student body.

I am curious to hear other opinions though. What are your thoughts on the honor code? Do you perceive that the majority of students like it or dislike it? Do you feel like it is time to implement any changes? If so, of what sort?",gxxnlg8,"I think the vast majority of students support *an* Honor Code, but the Honor Code as it stands needs a lot of fixes.

You'd think Raintree would do everything in their power to stop this kind of thing from happening and to get you your car back, but they probably won't.

I'm not saying BYU is harder to get into than other schools. 

But I think graduating with a high GPA at BYU is as tough or tougher than any school in the country. 

I had friends that went to some good schools. - UC Berkley, Pepperdine, USC, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine. 

With the exception of one friend who took his university studies very seriously, every other person I knew that went to these good schools partied their balls off. I'm talking the frat parties went down on Thursday nights. Of course Fri & Sat. Then the good ol' Sunday Funday of day drinking. - I didn't know anybody who knew anybody who partied or just drank alcohol at BYU. - The parties in Provo (with no alcohol) get shut down by the cops at midnight because the neighbors (who are married students) called and complained. 

That Testing Center is packed with people up until closing at 10 pm on Friday night. 

During my time at BYU, I swear about 40% of the students were married; some with children. 

So... Forget how hard the classes are... if your class is graded on a curve... Good luck. You're competing with students who don't party and might be married. I'm sorry but married people are more focused on doing well in school. They don't have to try to date or be social. 

I knew a guy who for whatever reason attended Brown University for his first semester of college, then transferred to BYU. He said the general ed classes he took at Brown weren't as hard as BYU's. 

I knew someone who was in the Business program at a school in southern California that everyone thinks is a top notch private school. But he really wanted to find a wife because he was 26, so he transferred to BYU and chose the shortest major - History. He said his History classes at BYU were way harder than his Business classes prior. 

I knew a girl who graduated from BYU, then got some Masters at Cal State Fullerton. She was going to be a teacher. She said BYU undergrad was harder. 

Thank you for reading my rant. 

I guess my main point is, it bothers me people don't know how hard BYU is that haven't attended. 

I have a 2.9 GPA from BYU, and was rejected from two schools for Grad School, so I'm bummed. I really had no business attending BYU. I got lucky getting in. I should have attended a state school. Then I'd have a higher GPA.

Part of it probably is because BYU attracts some top talent (so long as they’re LDS) with academic pedigrees who then come back and teach at the level of their experience. My department faculty was full of Berkeley/MIT/Stanford etc PhDs and post docs

Edit: to clarify, I TA’d general chemistry at both BYU and a large R1 school (for my PhD). BYU was definitely harder. My grad classes (400- and 600- level) were about as hard as 300 level BYU classes.",31.0,AeroStatikk,juvd8t9,"I think BYU is hard but besting schools like CSU Fullerton is not a surprise.   


I think one thing is that BYU has seen [net grade deflation](https://gradeinflation.com/) while other schools have inflated.   


To be honest there's a ton of nonsense majors in colleges these days that aren't designed towards specific careers. This is true of BYU, too. I think people just replace the partying with building families or other things. Also, they just decide to have shit grades. People make bad choices at every institution. It's 18 year olds learning how to be adults. Doesn't mean that UC Berkeley is less prestigious for it. My friend who transferred from UW is very serious about school and at least for her, BYU has been nicer to her academically.  


Just my two-cents.   


I think generally BYU is underrated. One reason they are so low in the rankings is because RM's taking more than 6-years to finish school, which is a major factor in US News, which happens to have a final say in a lot of people's minds. Kinda dumb...",24.0,None,juw6vo1,"Your rationale comes off as judgy, but I do agree that BYU (generally) provides a good education. I was accepted to a top engineering school for my masters and visited the school to meet with some professors and try to get some funding. Once of the professors I met with was impressed in my GPA *because* I was from BYU. He acknowledged that some schools inflate their grades, but he said BYU was one school where if you got an A in a class, you legitimately earned it. 

We had a professor in the ME department that did his Ph.D. at MIT. He was always quick to remind people that, in his opinion, the education we were getting at BYU was comparable to that from MIT, Stanford, etc. Especially with engineering where almost every school uses the same books for the core classes, the differences come down to research funding, school resources (which are often tied to research funding), and the alumni network. 

Now, these are isolated incidents, but I will say that in my experience, BYU is respected by people who know what they're talking about. And if I ever hear anyone scoff and assume that I'm somehow less of an engineer because I went to BYU, I know that they're biased or perhaps ignorant. And I try to remind myself that good engineers can easily come from other schools as well. At the end of the day, what matters is the work they put out not whether they earned their A in Heat Transfer.",18.0,engineering_aaron

I'm a Jewish journalist and I came out for both the rehearsal and performance of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" from the MDT program. I had a great time — everyone I spoke to was so earnest and thoughtful and I learned a lot about the LDS Church (also through this subreddit! I have an MA in religion so I get in deep) but it was also very strange to be in Provo, which feels extremely foreign to me.

I wrote a feature on the show, and on the Mormon-Jewish relationship, hope you guys will give it a read and let me know what you think.

You did a great job picking up on relevant threads between the faiths.,15.0,nikond750,i4c9f3n,"Thanks for sharing, I really enjoyed reading.",11.0,apricity5,i4cijyz,"Seems like a pretty insightful and fairly in-depth treatment. There are a few mentions of some small points of doctrine that are inaccurate but easily misunderstood, something that I think you may have experience with in covering Judaism. I don’t think they’re a very big deal. I think the part that sticks with me most is when you pointed out that in the production, the point is that God is silent. That’s a part of Judaism that’s so antithetical to how our own doctrine views our relationship with God that it can be hard to wrap my mind around it.

One of the recurring motifs in the Bible that becomes a bigger pattern in the context of Biblical and Book of Mormon scripture combined is God leading a chosen people out of a wicked or hostile place to a promised land. We see that in the examples of Abram leaving Ur and becoming Abraham, Moses and the Israelites leaving Egypt, and the return from Babylon, but also in the stories of Jared, his brother, and their families fleeing the Tower of Babel, Lehi and his family leaving Jerusalem and journeying to the New World, and Alma and Limhi leading their people back to the land of Zarahemla. Similarly, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the distinction of being the only religion in the history of the United States to have been subjected to an extermination order. We were forced out, arrived in Utah, and, if you’ll pardon the expression, we made the desert bloom like a rose. Being led to a promised land is a powerful symbol to us, and it links with our doctrine that people that choose to make covenants with God and therefore become part of His chosen people will eventually arrive in the ultimate promised land, the Celestial Kingdom.

This motif is also present in *Fiddler* when the entire Jewish community in Anatevka is forced to head for less hostile lands. I think that’s part of why the ending is so poignant for members of the church. However, I think we do tend to overlook the fact that God is not a character in *Fiddler*. He doesn’t speak, He doesn’t influence events, and for the purposes of the plot, He may as well be Tevye‘s imaginary friend. Your article helped open my eyes to just how much more deeply important the preservation of tradition is in Judaism compared to my own faith. Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the impression I got, which is that to us, tradition is very distinct from doctrine, and while correct traditions are good because they help to point us to God, doctrine is supercedingly important, to the point that doctrinally incorrect traditions are a spiritual danger. In Judaism, however, *the preservation of tradition is the whole point*. That’s all there is that’s left, because God no longer speaks to His chosen people.",10.0,reasonable_doubt1776

The code links to a blog post promoting a protest against the recent proof of vaccination requirements at public events. If you find one of these, don’t waste your time and don’t support them. Their reasons for protest are ridiculous for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, vaccination is still not a requirement. It is only indoor public events that require proof of vaccination *or a negative test result*.

Further, the blog also has a testimonial from a parent of a student athlete, in which the parent claims BYU is forbidding them from attending their child’s events. This parent trashes on BYU saying:

“I have invested much of my life to creating and nurturing this child and chose to help my child attend this school whom I actually (yes, stupidly) trusted and they treat me as if I am an enemy. They discriminate against me as if I am dirty or immoral. I am absolutely neither and I am standing up and pushing back for all students, all adults, and parents and fighting against discrimination and segregation.” 

To whoever this is and those who feel the same: You’ve probably never personally dealt with true discrimination or segregation, as other groups at BYU have, and continue to deal with. It is disgusting to me that these childish adults compare their selfish wishes to today’s true social issues. Grow up. 

Also, if this parent “stupidly trusted” BYU, why not just leave? I’m so tired of people like this playing the victim. Stop acting like you’re helpless to the situation when everything is in your power to solve it. Here are some ideas: leave BYU, get vaxxed, or just show a negative test result. 

This person also goes on to say that it is satanic to require vaccinations for such events since that is how satan would operate, and “good people would stand up to this!” Whether or not you are vaccinated, good people respect other people, and getting vaccinated or showing a negative test result are the literal bare minimum effort ways someone could show respect to the other attendees, the school, and the community in general. 

If you read the full article, you can see that the organizers are delusional. They claim that vaccination breaks the fourth amendment, is discrimination/ segregation, and is a type of bioweapon. 

Please don’t support people like this. If you choose not to get vaccinated, so be it. Clearly I am an advocate for vaccination but don’t hold it against you if you refrain. But don’t act like you don’t still have a choice under these new rules, and don’t compare yourself to truly marginalized groups. If your only social concern is vaccination, count your blessings and try to sympathize with those who are still unequal in society. 

The people who want to protest to “maintain their individual freedoms” (which they still have since nobody is forcing them to get vaccinated) are the same people fighting against (or at least not actively fighting for) women’s rights, racial injustice, LGBTQ+ rights, etc. The blatant hypocrisy is outrageous!

>Of all the schools or businesses to be doing this right now, it is so offensive and backwards that a school that claims to follow God would treat community members this way...

BYU happens to be sponsored by a church whose leaders have publicly endorsed the vaccines and encouraged all eligible members to get vaccinated as soon as they can. Requiring tests or proof of vaccination is a natural extension of that policy, particularly as public events that cram hundreds or thousands of people into a single room are ideal circumstances for a super-spreader event.

>This is exactly the way Satan would operate and good people would stand up to this!

This is a dumb, intellectually lazy argument. The Church also only allows people into temples who have active recommends, which are much harder to obtain than vaccines or COVID tests. Does that make them like Satan for restricting outside access?

>I have invested much of my life to creating and nurturing this child and chose to help my child attend this school whom I actually (yes stupidly) trusted...

So? BYU gets thousands of applicants a year than they have spots for. It's a privilege, not a right, to attend BYU (or any other postsecondary institution). BYU owes this person nothing.

>I am standing up and pushing back for all students, all adults, and parents and fighting against discrimination and segregation.

Another intellectually lazy statement. Refusing to comply with public health guidelines doesn't make you an oppressed member of society any more than being denied entry to a movie theater for refusing to put on a shirt is grounds for a lawsuit; it just makes you an idiot.

It’s a great institution and I feel privileged to be here.

My main concern is that I virtually have no desire to attend church anymore. Ever since my mission my testimony has steadily declined and now I’m not sure I really believe anymore. When I attend church services I feel empty and disingenuous. I don’t want to transfer schools because I worked so hard to get here and I love it here. But I’m worried about the honor code since I don’t attend down here. My family lives an hour away so I enjoy spending weekends with them when I can. I occasionally attend church with them. 

I really want to be a good person and serve others. I want to minister to others and help bring about Zion. I figure the church is a great way to do that, but each time I attend I leave feeling sadder and more discouraged.

I still pay my tithing diligently so I’m not free-loading (as much) on my subsidized tuition. Does anyone have any advice or insight?

EDIT: just to clarify, I am living every other aspect of the honor code. I feel sad and discouraged because my participation in the church for the most part has been to placate my parents (they have sacrificed a lot for me and my inactivity would make them feel like they have failed or that I am rebelling against them). This brings me sadness at church because I feel that on some level I’ll probably never have that child-like faith again and that now I’m attending for the wrong reasons.",hiugwzy,"My advice is to spend some time pondering and praying about three things: your testimony of Christ, your testimony of the COJCOLDS, and your testimony of your Ward. When I was closer to your age, I was prone to feeling that if Jesus was real, then my home teachers ought to actually care about me, and that if my Sunday School teacher taught a good lesson that must mean the atonement is real. I don't believe either of those things. I'm all for giving people as much grace as possible, but sometimes your Ward just sucks. Sometimes people around you are idiots, and sometimes BYU culture makes you want to run away screaming. These things can make it a lot harder to be excited about church, but they're not worth ditching (or joining) a religion over.

As an ""old man"" (comparatively) I like to say that I actually believe fewer things than I used to, but I'm more firmly rooted to Christ. There have been times in life where I've just had to hunker down with that knowledge and wait until I was able to resolve some other things.

You got this!",28.0,Wifijoe,hivsqnv,"The BYU survival guide ( https://byusurvivalguide.com/ ) is a useful resource for your situation. BYU does not supply any support or resources for students who lose their faith for any reason, so it can be isolating and difficult to keep going, especially when leaving isn't a realistic solution or when trauma is involved.

If you want to regain a testimony, whether in the church or outside it, I'd recommend spending time outside of church discovering what parts of your religious upbringing and beliefs you value, and what kind of person you want to be. 

If the church helps you to live those values and be that person, great! If not, that's great too! The church doesn't have a monopoly on spirituality or truth or goodness. It's okay to find what you need in other places, in other churches or inside yourself. It's not a betrayal of BYU or the church. After all, I figure God would rather you be a good person than just a good member.

The biggest one for me though is the off campus housing stuff that BYU has created. It is a system that has been around for decades and clearly doesn't work very well.

BYU has been sending me mixed messages regarding COVID and how we are supposed to deal with it.   My fiance and I have both tested positive for COVID-19 as of yesterday and are in NO condition to be attending classes for at least the next week, possibly two. Both of us have classes that require in-person participation and do not offer Zoom options for students who are sick or have COVID-19. We have contacted the professors of our respective classes and the response has overwhelmingly been to just collect notes from our classmates and take the hit on our participation grades. For 2 of my classes and 3 of hers though, we know we won't be able to make up the material without attending and found out that we are likely to be dropped a half-letter grade in missed participation without the impact of whatever missed material we have to catch up on.

So this is my question: if BYU is concerned so much about the pandemic, why do they not require all professors to have a zoom option for their courses? We have been in a pandemic for the better part of 2 years now and it's astonishing to me that we can be mandated to stay at home and yet be punished for complying with BYU and the CDC's guidelines. What is even more frustrating though is the classrooms we typically attend all have been set up with tens of millions of dollars worth of microphones and cameras that were paid for with our tuition and tithing money to resolve this very issue, yet remain unutilized by professors who are ""over the pandemic"".  We are all tired of the pandemic, I understand that, but BYU is not a school that you can miss a week or two of and keep up good grades. I know grades aren't everything, but for students who are working to get into graduate school or beyond, they do matter quite a bit.

For other BYU students, have you had experiences similar to this one? Should we just attend classes, double-masked, and sit in a corner somewhere? Should this issue be brought up to someone? We can not be the only ones currently experiencing this issue, and what happens when students decide to attend sick anyways?

Thanks for reading if you made it.

Lots of charts related to tuition and campus income/expenses. Enjoy!

The tithing subsidies equates to:

* 78% tuition scholarship for BYU Provo
* 92% for BYU Hawaii
* 31% for BYU Idaho
* 61% for Ensign College

Note: the data is based on audited financials, available online here:

They're teaching me about how to become like them. I'm not sure if you're up to the task, but next time I see them I can drop your name. Maybe they will want to meet you? Do you want to speed up your financial track?

&#x200B;

Ok, this has happened to me 4 times now. It's really starting to bug me/freak me out. Different people, one in Ohio and 3 in Provo. They ask you a ton of questions about your life and pretty much that's it. Then they will start to slide in references about how they have these mentors. This awesome couple just doesn't have to worry about money anymore. They spend their time as philanthropists. Helping people like you and them to do the same. Sounds great right? Here's where it gets weird. They usually ask to set up a follow-up visit (similar to on the mission). During the next visit, they just ask you more questions about your goals. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, you're starting to wonder what this is all about. Why is this person who barely knows you taking such a big interest in you?

What do your mentors do for a living?

Have you ever heard of information-based assets? That's what they teach me about.

Cool, I'd like to meet them.

Ok, but they are VERY busy and only take a few people on at a time. I can ask them if they would want to teach you.

What are they teaching?

It's not really mine to say.

What, did you sign a non-disclosure?

No, I just really respect my mentor. It's theirs to share.

Usually, if you press hard enough they will say that it takes 6 weeks before the mentor would be willing to share what they are teaching. They need to learn to ""trust"" you first. They want to get to know you.

&#x200B;

All of it's super creepy to me. They all seem to be the same kind of people. Summer sales bros who don't have any money (work at a dead-end job like at a gym). I also study sales techniques and they are using almost all of them to try to get me to meet their mentors. However, many questions still remain. What are their mentors teaching them, why are they so motivated to introduce me to them, how come if you're meeting with these super-rich mentors are you still a poor college student. Speaking of which all of them decided that college wasn't for them.

&#x200B;

Ok, this is getting really long-winded, but now that's it happened 4 times it's not an isolated event. They all say very similar things. Basically, have any of you had similar experiences?

Bhad Bhabie went after Dr Phil for sending her to an abusive center located in Utah. 

I’m a BYU Psychology graduate and active Latter-Day Saint. Internship offices and advisors often recommended and even recruited for local residential treatment centers. After working at two between 2019 and 2021, I concluded that the industry (especially the centers in Utah) is rife with abuse. It’s an easy job to get, and looks “great” on a resume, but it’s not worth the malpractice and neglect that goes on. I’m astounded that BYU schools still help recruit for these places. The best professors I know told us to stay far away. Well-meaning but untrained BYU students have no business getting involved in inpatient psychiatric treatment.

I won’t put all the details about the industry here, but head over to r/troubledteens if you want more info. Look specifically for facilities like Center for Change, New Haven, Maple Lake Academy, Heritage, And Telos. Those are frequently posted as hiring on BYU job boards.

EDIT: Let me just add here: the anti-troubled teen industry movement has some very strong anti-mormon feelings. I can understand why. Most owners of these facilities are LDS, and most employees are well-meaning but uninformed and undertrained returned missionaries.

Let’s hear some specifics. The word “abuse” is thrown around a lot these days to mean anything critical, disciplinary, or leading to general hardship, none of which are egregious when trying to abruptly alter the destructive behavior of unresponsive individuals. 

I’m not saying that you’re wrong, I’m just saying I’m skeptical of general claims of “abuse.” I’ve heard Paris Hilton’s accusations, but they were also from a different generation, so I’m still skeptical. Open our eyes to what’s going on if it’s truly concerning.",13.0,ScumbagGina

“Update: Vaccination Status Report
BYU is grateful for the COVID-19 vaccination status reports received in the last week, but there are many students who have still not responded. This vaccination status report is required of all students who have enrolled this fall. Without an increase in the number of reported vaccinations from the campus community, BYU will need to take precautionary measures, such as requiring masks. Other measures may also be necessary.”

I haven’t cared at all if people get vaccinated. Maybe I don’t know the science well enough but it seems to me that the only people that are affected by someone not getting vaccinated are the anti-vaxxers. Someone else not getting vaccinated doesn’t have a huge influence on my ability as a vaccinated person to get sick. And the amount of people that can’t get vaccinated because of allergies is incredibly low. So I’ve never really been mad about people not get vaccinated, I’ve just kind of thought they were dumb. But I can’t blame/judge/get angry at people for lacking intelligence.

However - if we have to wear masks because of it, I will be mad. I’ve never heard of a respectable person not getting the vaccine.  Everyone that doesn’t get it just seems like they are blinded by something. I thought once the literal prophet posted a photo of him getting it, people would start to do it. It is idiotic to think that everyone (including the prophet and quorum of the twelve) are being duped by the CDC. Or that because it went through a different testing process, it isn’t safe. 

We all want a good college experience again and if the anti-vaxxers are the ones who take my freedom to have that away, I’m going to be very upset with them. Besides the obvious one of being allergic to an ingredient in all three vaccines, I don’t care what their reasonings for not getting it are.",h8aw2bs,Also to keep in mind that BYU requires international students to be vaccinated against MMR and other diseases and tests for TB before allowing them to register for classes.,42.0,coldcoldnovemberrain,h8apwd5,"I understandably respect the freedom of choice as well.

That being said, I had a ton of family friends move from California to Utah County recently. Most of them were anti-vaxx, but more because they liked alternative medicine and not as much politics. (Pseudoscience medicine is big in SoCal).

A bunch of them contracted the delta variant of COVID recently and it hospitalized quite a few of their family members. A husband and cousin were the only ones vaccinated and showed no symptoms at all. Now pretty much all of these people have switched their stance on vaccines and recommend people get them. A lot of them got the first round of COVID almost a year ago too. So there’s my anecdote. 

I guess it’s important to have freedoms.

This is what I wish I knew way back when I was a smol 14-15 year old if I could do it all over again with the same knowledge I have now:

\-AP Credit is almost useless for a lot of classes. Don't take AP Lit (you've already taken AP Lang, so it won't help you), and don't bother with APUSH. The exams are nice for validation, but not nice for actually satisfying gen ed reqs.

\-When they tell you to ""experiment"" and take lots of different classes your freshman year, this doesn't apply if you want to go into engineering. Only take required classes.  (of course I wouldn't have known that I want to be an engineer if I hadn't taken different classes and figured out that engineering classes appealed to me most)

\-Deadlines and due dates actually matter. There is no mercy here.

\-You don't have to be smart in college, you just have to be diligent. Do your homework on a schedule and use a planner.

\-Don't take 8 classes in a semester, even if some of them are very few amounts of credits. There is a sweet spot at 3 credits where you get the most bang for your buck. Try to mostly take these types of classes. 1 or 2 credit classes are way too much effort, and 4 credit classes are usually specifically engineered to be a full-time job and drive you into deep depression.

\-Take spring and summer classes. They're easier and less work, and they're actually saving you money because you'll graduate faster. The only time you're better off taking a semester or term off is when you have an internship.

\-Make friends. This is just as important as doing well in class.

\-Make study groups early on. You may not end up meeting very often, but it's great to have a friend who you can text at the last minute when you aren't sure about something - and it feels great to do the same for someone else.

\-Go to career fairs, join clubs, and try to do all the networking stuff. It probably seems useless but it matters.

\-Don't listen to music while you study. No matter how much you try to rationalize it, it never helps you. Even if it's Bach or Mozart.

\-Don't ever let yourself compromise on sleep. You need to be well-rested for class- otherwise, you might as well not even go. You will learn that you cannot stay awake in class unless you've had your 7-8 hours.

\-Carve out time for fun on the weekends. You need to turn off the ""school"" part of your brain sometimes, and if you can't do it on a schedule, you'll end up doing it involuntarily at times when you can't afford to check out.

Your friend and everyone else affected need to contact BYU's housing office immediately. Even if they aren't students.

Background: I am related to one of the owners of a not-insignificant property management company (NOT Redstone, thank goodness) and I was talking to them about the change. Below is a summary of what I was told:

The major property management companies had a meeting and it came down to them asking Redstone what they were going to do. Redstone's response was: probably drop all units from BYU approval and increase rent prices. When the management company responsible for 30% of the rental market in the area makes a decision like that, guess what the rest of the companies who are in the same market decide to do?

Housing for freshmen is going to be ULTRA competitive for the off campus so a lot of freshmen are going to have to be in on campus. Additionally, (and some folks might choose to be offended by this) some of the ultra sheltered type that aren't used to their roommates being the opposite sex, drinking alcohol, and riding the bologna pony/slammin' the clam might have to do a little bit of growing up when they experience a light version of what the world outside of Utah looks like. And on top of that, goodbye are the days of getting out of your contract because you're getting married, going on a mission, or _________ reason that currently permits people to break their contract unless you are willing to take the companies to court and somehow have more money than they do.

There's going to be some other second and third order effects that people aren't seeing now, but it's certainly is going to bring a shake up to the Provo Orem housing market. Downvote me if you want, but I'm just telling you what was told to me.

PS : Go Cougs, beat USF!",heakh0p,"If what you said about that meeting is true, that's 100% anti-competitive behavior and actionable.",56.0,First_TM_Seattle,heae98k,"The nice thing about this change though is that while Redstone and other management companies own a large percentage of the area immediately south of campus - you can choose not to live there anymore. I haven't kept tabs on single housing for a couple of years now - but when I was living with my roommates before I was married I was surprised at how much the drop-off in prices was when looking in Orem, or other places surrounding the BYU-Zone. There are obviously added hassles to figure out, transportation being the big one, but for me personally, if it came down to renting at Redstone or Aspen Ridge, or living in Orem, I'm going to take the low prices, higher quality, but farther away housing, rather than the horrible management, higher prices, and low quality. I'm sure Redstone and others won't dramatically suffer from this because even if they increase prices, proximity to campus is a big factor for people. The big change here is now students actually have options, and if you want cheap housing and are willing to live a bit farther out, that's available.",43.0,okovango10,heaz7vd,"What is the rationale for raising rent?

This idea also works if you are trying to get to know people. Choose something outside your major that you are interested in and not a core class for another major. 

 These courses could be classes like: 

*  Creative Writing 
*  Book Binding 
*  Floral Design 
*  Beginning Sewing Construction 
*  Introduction to Film 
*  An Unusual Language like Welsh 
*  Camping Skills 
*  Rock Climbing 
*  Fly Fishing 
*  Martial Arts 
*  Bowling 
*  Pretty Much Anything on the Student Wellness Catalog 
*  Stained Glass 
*  Intro to Sculpture for Non-Majors 
*  Folk Music Ensemble
*  And many more

 I have specifically avoided putting dance classes in here as they make trying to meet someone awkward. Likely because dancing is already seen as a way to meet people. 

 Anyway, by taking these classes, you'll meet people who share your interest but not your major. Because this isn't a class in your major, you'll find you are less stressed about the course and have time to get to know the people in the class. As it is a class you picked, you now have something to discuss with the people you are meeting. That gives you a step to build a connection and build a friendship. 

 It seems that people get caught in the grind of trying to date in their singles wards or just apartment complexes. Sure they are nearby, but the chance they are interested in the same things you are is lower. By choosing an elective, you increase your chances to meet people with whom you can connect. 

I will note, though, that you should make sure you have a legitimate interest in the class and that you're not just taking it to meet someone. That comes across pretty clearly and can be pretty creepy. Perhaps that's why the dance class dating stuff comes across as awkward.

 So that's my recommendation for students wondering how to meet people and make friends.

Rant over, stay safe out there",irz80uc,"In the same vein: cars, please stop throwing caution to the wind and doing everything you can to get around my bike. I'm already as far to the right as I can get. It's not my fault BYU decided they didn't need a bike lane on the road leading to the Marriott.

I don't appreciate people risking my life so they can get to their destination two minutes faster.",45.0,lo_profundo,iryyjcz,"If you're crossing at 11pm on a Thursday, whatever just look both ways and go for it.

No one in the comments is gonna convince me that the burden of safety falls on the pedestrian on crosswalks that are on campus though. Yeah, it's crazy rude to jaywalk when other vehicles are waiting for you, but if you're going fast enough to where breaking on time is impossible, you ought to be held legally responsible for driving that fast (or often distractedly) in a crowded area. I see way too many distracted and fast drivers on campus roads that make the area so much more dangerous for a non-driver like me",22.0,None
xcmlmu,Erased from Maxwell Institute,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/xcmlmu/erased_from_maxwell_institute/,37,2022-09-12 20:04:19+00:00,thoughtfulsaint,"I am an avid reader and listener to whatever the Maxwell Institute puts out. I think they have high quality content that causes me to think deeper about our doctrine and scriptures. However, I have noticed a troubling trend. It appears that someone at BYU or at the Institute arbitrarily decides to silence certain scholars and erase them as if they had never been a part of the Institute.

&#x200B;

One public example of this was Benjamin Parks. At one point either last year or the year before anything he had contributed to MI was wiped from their site.  I assume this was due to his public criticisms of BYU and the Church in general. However, a less public example was Deidre Nicole Green. She was a fellow at the Maxwell Institute and wrote the Brief Theological Intro to Jacob as part of their series. However, when I went back later to listen to her interview on the book (the Maxwell institute podcast interviewed each author in the series), they had removed it from the site and from all podcast feeds. All the other author interviews were still available. They had also wiped any mention of her from their website. I was unable to ever find out the reason why. Can anyone share some insight into how this happens and why in particular Green was removed in this manner?",io77xbb,"I actually met Deidre and discussed this with her so I know what happened. I won’t go into personal details but the decision to remove all of her work from BYU was her decision, not BYU’s. I believe that was around September of last year, although I’m not sure how long after that until the Maxwell Institute had removed everything. So, in her case at least, it’s not BYU choosing to silence certain scholars, but rather those scholars choosing not to publish through BYU.",49.0,austinchan2,io8ylv3,"I don't know specifically about the people you're asking about, but when I worked for BYU Speeches we frequently had to take stuff down and people got mad at us for it. The reason was almost always coming from the speaker, not BYU. Often they would give us permission to publish their words for only a certain period of time, and then we were legally required to pull it. If an author, speaker, whatever no longer wants their work up on a BYU site, it's just taken down for them.

Occasionally there were other reasons, like if an older speech had some blatantly racist or homophobic remarks it would get pulled, and sometimes republished after changes had been approved by the speaker. Don't know if any of this info helps, but I figured I'd share before you accuse someone of intentionally removing things. There are often a lot of behind the scenes things that people are trying to take care of.",12.0,ekmckenzie,io65dm5,It may not be as sinister as you think. It looks like the website has had some sort of update as all the posts seem to indicate they were made today. I suspect that a lot of stuff is being transferred over from one server to another.  It may be that they finally adopted the same website content management system as the rest of BYU and so it's taking some time to transfer the old site content over to the new.  I could be wrong maybe the webpage is just wonky like that with posts but every news post saying it was posted today on there makes me thing this is the reasoning.,7.0,True-Grab8522

They are currently just normal bagels covered in shredded mozzarella cheese, topped with two to three pepperonis.  For those of you who don't know what the glorious pizza bagels used to be like, they used to be covered in sauce and loads of melted cheese.  They were amazing when served fresh and almost as good re-heated in the microwave.  Now they look like a three year old's attempt at making a pizza in an easy bake oven.  This is more outrageous than telling a transfer student their A- in Econ is what's holding them back from getting out of American Heritage.  I would rather do classes online for the rest of my degree than suffer through crummy pizza bagels.  We need somebody to do something about this.
