You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

I'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them. Remember, don't be downwind of John when you and your friends go to pee on him, and, most importantly, YUCK FALE!"

fgdxf3,Unsure of how to flex now that classes will be online? Read here.,321,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/fgdxf3/unsure_of_how_to_flex_now_that_classes_will_be/,14,2020-03-10 13:37:40+00:00,HarvardDating,"By now I'm sure you're all aware that classes after spring break will be held virtually. ""But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?"" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&adults=1&check_in=2020-04-22&check_out=2020-04-30&source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from. Make sure to wash your hands before you eat those McChickens, and only cough on the Yalies."

bxkn2t,Rising Senior: I got rejected from every internship I applied to.,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bxkn2t/rising_senior_i_got_rejected_from_every/,24,2019-06-06 19:09:21+00:00,thedietitian,"With the onslaught of celebratory grad school, commencement, and internship posts on Facebook, I thought I would throw a glitch in the matrix and share my story: I was rejected from every summer internship that I applied to. It's the (supposedly) all-important junior summer, and I have nothing to do. But to be honest, I'm kind of okay with it. 

I think rejection stories are extremely important to share. I don't think we hear about them at Harvard as much as we should, but there's beauty in vulnerability. I started applying to summer internships several months ago. I even made it to the third round of interviews at my dream internship, and the company didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I was rejected. I had to ask them. After the onslaught of rejection letters sent to my inbox, I even began applying to random, mostly unpaid internships I found on Indeed, and I didn't get those either. I even applied to sell books at Barnes & Noble and I didn't get that too! And that was supposed to be Plan C.

But I want people to know that it's okay to get rejected. It totally happens. Rejection is not a reflection of your qualifications and self-worth. I do believe there's beauty in doing nothing, and I'm going to spend the summer entertaining myself and achieving my personal goals. I have every intention of sitting on my behind and watching 19+ seasons of Million Dollar Listing. I also want to get in shape and finally read the books on my bucket list that I haven't been able to because of schoolwork. Every time you get rejected from something, you can focus on something that you chose to do and what's truly meaningful to you. I like to think of it this way: I don't have to slave over a task delegated to me by a superior. This summer, I'm charting my own path.

My family is pretty upset about all the nothing I'm doing, and I'm not really sure how to address that. They have high expectations. But I have to say, I'm semi-happy with how my summer is going. Sure, it's cool that my peers are doing internships at Facebook, Google, and L'Oréal. But I also think it's really important to cast rejection in a positive light. You own the time that you've been given. You're free to define the hours as you see fit. I hate waking up at the crack of dawn, and now I can spend my time sleeping until the early afternoon. I hate commuting, and I've gained back three hours of time I would've spent commuting roundtrip. 

I don't really know how to conclude this post, but I just wanted to share that rejection happens to Harvard students and it's totally okay: cast that rejection in a positive light."

ija9di,It's worth revisiting the Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017...,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/ija9di/its_worth_revisiting_the_harvard_meme_scandal_of/,24,2020-08-30 09:47:10+00:00,throwawayharvard2021,"Hello. Throwaway here.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I'm curious to hear what members of this community think."

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

If they're going to be checking IDs at 5PM, let's just do it all day, maybe?"

Whereas before the virus you might have had a weekly homework/problem set/ reading assignment, now 4 of my 5 classes assign work to be done throughout the week, it's not more difficult to do, but just more difficult to organize. 

For example, I'm taking one course right now that assigns weekly readings, normal right? Nope, with the pandemic, we're expected to make comments on reading by Saturday night, respond to our peers' comments by Sunday night and do like 3 separate video responses.

Some facts:

&#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

&#x200B;

The most important is #6 as that is an incorrect explanation seen around here a lot. If you have economics or statistics training, please see my detailed explanation in this comment: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/9nelz5/antiasian\_bias\_not\_affirmative\_action\_is\_on\_trial/e7qy2rn/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/9nelz5/antiasian_bias_not_affirmative_action_is_on_trial/e7qy2rn/?context=3)

hu0m2g,Did I make a mistake choosing Harvard?,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/hu0m2g/did_i_make_a_mistake_choosing_harvard/,30,2020-07-19 13:37:49+00:00,bigbluebottle123,"Two years ago. I applied early action, never expected to get in, but when I did, I then immediately accepted my offer - because it's Harvard. I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action. Maybe I'm desperate to not be completely miserable, but can someone give me a reason as to why Harvard is the right choice over these other schools? About what makes Harvard actually better despite the fact that my life here was so miserable?"

cmztpo,Looking to speed run the three traditions?,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/cmztpo/looking_to_speed_run_the_three_traditions/,4,2019-08-07 02:16:02+00:00,HarvardDating,"While students at other institutions may spend their time thinking about their grades, future careers, or their LinkedIn, Harvard students have a unique set of problems they face: **How to complete the three traditions as quickly as possible.**


No, going as a Yalie for your first Halloween in Cambridge isn't a tradition, but looking around you'll be led to believe it is. The three traditions I'm talking about, of course, are having sex in the stacks, peeing on John Harvard, and participating in the Primal Scream. While STEM concentrations may think they're too busy to do any of this, or that people couldn't *actually* be having sex in Widener, us social science concentrations are well aware of the social pressures put onto every student here to partake in these traditions prior to graduating.

If you're determined, any dedicated Harvard student can complete the trifecta of traditions in less than 10 minutes. Luckily, since typically [65% of the matriculating class are virgins,](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/harvards-class-2017-full-virgins-and-thats-okay/311342/) none of you should have any problem completing **step one: having sex in the stacks** in a matter of minutes. The hardest part of this is agreeing on which section to practice procreation in. While Greek Philosophy is a popular one, I typically choose the *Love Languages* section, just to set the mood a bit.

Once you've completed the first task and left Widener, you should have about 7 minutes left, which is more than enough time to get over to the John Harvard statue. This step is arguably the most important, as **step two: peeing on John Harvard** doesn't only serve to complete the tradition, but is an important measure to take in order to prevent UTIs. Depending on the equipment of your partner you may have to give them a lift, or help each other up, but synchronizing streams, while not necessary, is certainly preferred.

Conveniently, this act can be used to kill two birds with one stone, and **step three: the Primal Scream** is generally an involuntary reaction to the burning sensation you feel while peeing on John after having sex with a stranger in the stacks. Be sure to make it a good one, this is your moment. Everyone's eyes are on you, people are leaning out of Thayer to cheer you on, and they want to hear a walloping, unadulterated scream. Similar to step two, this is a good opportunity to team up with your partner and harmonize a bit. Give the Krokodiloes a run for their money.

After dismounting from the statue, you should have just under a minute left, which is just enough time for the two of you to decide which of you is running to the HEM, and which to Malkin, for you both to shower the shame off. Shake dry hands, congratulate each other, and begin sprinting your separate ways into the night."

I think there were times when I think the grass would be greener down the street, or that school on the other coast (and perhaps wished that I’d chosen differently), but I learned so much, and what I’ve taken away in terms of lessons are mostly not academic oriented but rather on dealing with life and relationships.

p4bzma,A summary of the discord drama and how it relates to the subreddit,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p4bzma/a_summary_of_the_discord_drama_and_how_it_relates/,19,2021-08-14 17:12:43+00:00,toadbro,"Recently, the discord that is associated with this subreddit has gone through some major changes. In short, the members of the discord have completely migrated over to a new discord with the previous mods as the owners.

Why did the members decide to change discords? As another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p3c2y9/wrong_discord_on_subreddit_sidebar/) mentions, this was due to issues with the ownership. The specific issues were summarized in that thread, but the thread was locked before other members could elaborate on the details. The owner was never present, took credit for the work the two main admins did, and refused to transfer ownership even after a vote among the moderators on discord. This server was massive, highly active, and a crucial social hub especially during the pandemic, but almost nobody knew who the owner was. In fact, the owner had as little as 13 messages in the server over several years. This all got intense over the last couple of months as the owner ghosted all of the members, including the admins.

Now, this all just seems like isolated discord drama. This directly relates to the subreddit as the owner and one other admin are the major moderators of this subreddit. Even though the new [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/harvard) is the only active one of the two, the owner of the other discord server changed the link on the subreddit to redirect to their server rather than the active one.

All of these problems are a result of the moderation teams on both the previous discord and the current subreddit. The top moderators are not Harvard affiliated anymore and have been the main power holders for an extended period of time. We would not be opposed to the idea of alumni as moderators, but these particular moderators have shown no interest in being a part of the communities they are moderating and should pass off their roles to active members of the communities.

Perhaps instead of locking threads with questions and ghosting us more, you can take some time and answer them directly. Also, there is still a link to the discord on the subreddit. You should probably remove that if you are totally trying to disconnect from the discords."

A doggy door gate is cheaper, makes the yard more accessible to dogs, and is just funny. 

For an added bonus we can tell tourist if their kid manages to crawls through the gate they get an increased chance of being admitted. 

There are basically zero downsides, pm me for my venmo and further funding details"

Are you considering emailing your professor/TF/CA/Course head and telling them that you can't find the link, but are well aware you just can't find the link because you're sleep deprived and too proud to admit when you're wrong? 

If you answered yes to any of the above try sending your emails with scheduled send!

In the parents class of 2020 page, there are lots of graduation things being posted lately. I saw a post of a HUGE banner that the parents hung over their garage with the picture of the graduate and their name and everything for the neighborhood to see.

I understand that maybe some of these parents don’t have another outlet to share the good news (especially due to COVID), but I find most of it to be very off putting. My mom mostly shares news with my grandparents or occasionally her friends, not other Harvard parents. Perhaps that is exactly the point of these Harvard parents groups and I am just not into that sort of stuff. I guess they are proud of their kids and want to share it with some like-minded parents? To each their own.

Just wondering how other people perceive this sort of stuff? Do you like it? Or not care at all? Just wondering."

I’ve frankly just gotten really frustrated with how the professors here have been grading us in my classes and maybe I just had it easier at my high school or something and I’m bitching for nothing?

But I just think it’s wrong when one of my classes has a policy that only a certain percentage of the class can get an A, so a 96 was the cutoff for an A (which I BARELY made). I just don’t understand how most of my professors proclaim that they’re not trying to pit us against each other and grades don’t matter and then implement systems like this? I went into my math final with a 100% and left with a B+ because I did average (as in I did 4 questions perfectly and the other 2 had some mistakes in it) on the final so that corresponded to a two letter grade drop..?

I’ve just become really jaded especially given that my math professor barely taught us this entire year and so as a result I was teaching myself basically everything. I’m just like maybe this is the reality of college? I hate how everyone talks about grade inflation at Harvard because I’ve had the exact opposite experience, I’ve only had my grades deflated despite putting in my absolute best. I’ve become frustrated because I can’t even enjoy learning anymore because I’m stressing out so much about my grade.

I keep telling myself to be thankful that I’m at Harvard and I absolutely am and don’t get me wrong, I’ve had an amazing academic and personal experience thusfar, I’ve just found that I feel like the way most classes are graded here actively pit students against each other. I mean hell, I went to an underfunded high school and now I’m competing with kids for grades who went to schools like Exeter, Trinity, etc… it just doesn’t feel right."

In truth, MAT 157 is the most difficult of such courses, delving into topics generally not covered by even the most experienced of Real Analysts. 

&#x200B;

In the first week, we cover Horseshoe Analysis, showing that even the most insane integrals can be shown to be true with a simple symbological statement. Horseshoe functions are integrable in real space. Currently, we are exploring applications of Horseshoe Induction in the Riemann Hypothesis over finite vector ring spaces. Our class, which began with 250 people, currently hosts 25 attendees, 10 of which who are currently viewing the material from the local psych ward. Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of proving the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) over finite fields in real space. The only prerequisite of this course is High School Calculus, with recommended courses in Latin and Greek Philosophy. All students are required to attend seminars ranging from 5 hours to 11 hours a day in which students discuss Richard and Mortimer and the metaphysical implications of the topics discussed.

pgozep,Viewed file and lowkey feeling imposter syndrome,52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/pgozep/viewed_file_and_lowkey_feeling_imposter_syndrome/,13,2021-09-02 19:33:44+00:00,shawtzb,"So, I was able to view my file today and I just thought it was really interesting.

I’m not officially supposed to record/mention any specific details or exact quotes so I’m not gonna do any of that but just give a general gist…

Basically both of my readers said that while I was a nice, caring, and empathetic person who had consistent school support I guess from my letter of recs and made note of my experience as a manager in a store along with my marching band experience, they basically said I had nothing distinguishing about myself and that they’re unsure about my strength with regards to the entire applicant pool which lowkey stung. They said that they wanted to see an interview report and compare me with the “full pool” to be I guess more sure of my file/using it as a guiding reference for as to whether I should get in or not. For further reference, I was deferred and then admitted.

My interview report was actually very kind and he ranked me really high (1- in personality, 2+ in academics) so ultimately I think that really helped my case? He wrote a lot of detailed notes about what we talked about and picked up on really small details that actually made me pretty happy that he remembered. 

I mean, I had a very mediocre high school experience and never really planned on applying to an Ivy League so it was as expected. But at the same time the “nothing distinguishing” comment and the fact that they ranked me a 3+ overall, which was also weird cause they ranked me 2 in academics, 2 in personality, 4 in athletics, and 2- in EC, makes me feel like I could’ve easily been rejected and just thrown to the side if just one small thing had changed .

I know that they obviously don’t make mistakes and in the end I’m very happy to be here, but idk some of their comments lowkey kinda hurt and also the fact that 3+ are admitted somewhere at 7-9% makes me feel like I just barely made it in :/ I’ll get over it but yeah bleh just needed to rant"
il11wo,"Change name from Harvard Extension School to Harvard School of Professional Studies, Harvard School of Liberal Arts or Harvard School of Continuing Education.",55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/il11wo/change_name_from_harvard_extension_school_to/,53,2020-09-02 05:37:11+00:00,SnooOranges423," 

It's the only Extension school that offers degrees. Extension school is misleading and for those of us who have degrees, people think we are in the same pool as those who have taken one online course some random time period ago.

Less than 1% of extension students even obtain a degree from HES. It devalues our diploma when the public thinks we took a few online courses.

Columbia changed theirs to Professional Studies and it worked out great for them. I understand that Harvard doesn't want to equate our degrees with other schools but we also deserve recognition for completing the degree given the difficulty in obtaining the degree and finishing an independent research thesis.

If you are a student or alumni reading this, please form a coalition or group. Reach out to professors for support. Email your Deans. I am simply too busy to continue this campaign but I hope this fight for the name change will continue."

I'm from Canada and the request I have is probably pretty odd. 

My mum lived out in Eastern Canada and back in the 70s and 80s visited areas like ME, NY, and MA. She had this Grey Harvard sweatshirt that just had the words ""Harvard"" in red across the front she picked up visiting the campus. I wore it a lot as a kid in the 90s and LOVED that thing, but it got lost long ago, how I'm not sure. My mum died in 2016 and over years since you know how one thinks of the past. Well I remembered the sweatshirt and how much I miss having it.

I don't believe the Harvard store ships to Canada and I'm out in western Canada (Alberta) so taking a trip even without covid wouldn't be exactly a day drive. Do any of you guys know where I might be able to order an official sweatshirt? 

It looks like the following without the ""University EST. 1636"" on it, just the the word ""Harvard"" but that colour way.

Sorry if this breaks any rules just trying to get my hands on a piece of the past ya know.

Edit: hey guys just woke up and wanted to thank you so much for all the info! I really appreciate it. Also to the kind redditor who will apparently be up in my city next week thank you so much for your offer!"
