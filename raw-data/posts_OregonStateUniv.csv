Much love to Coach Smith for bringing relevance back to OSU football and lots of hate for ESPN, USC, UCLA, Ed Ray, and George Kliavkoff. 

Gonna be really rough financially and culturally for OSU and Corvallis going forward."

1gqr86x,Information for Undergrads During TA Strike,292,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonStateUniv/comments/1gqr86x/information_for_undergrads_during_ta_strike/,69,2024-11-13 23:46:16+00:00,jle3456,"Graduate student here. Just wanted to share some stuff here for undergrads who may feel confused, anxious, and upset at everything going on with your TAs and instructors.

Most importantly, **do not let OSU lie to you.** Ed Feser had a field day with different percentages and stats in his all-student email, but if you look at the actual dollar signs (which he conveniently excluded) you'll see the facts. Our current minimum salary is **$1,762** ***before taxes***. For comparison, the minimum wage in Corvallis equates to $2,272/month, and the Corvallis livable wage for a single adult with no dependents is $3,519.20/month (per [MIT](https://livingwage.mit.edu/metros/18700)). OSU's proposed 10% increase to this minimum, in this context, means NOTHING. I've heard many people taken aback by the fact that we are asking for a 45% raise to the minimum salary. This would make the minimum salary around $2550/month. **A 45% increase is still significantly below a livable wage.**

OSU is also trying to remove our contract's 2-year reopener. Two-year reopeners not only allow us to re-negotiate in times of unprecedented change (as we did during the pandemic) but allows us to teach new union members how to bargain properly. **Removing the contract reopener is an attempt to restrict the union's bargaining knowledge** by only allowing us to bargain every 4 years. This is longer than the length of time that a typical master's student will even be at OSU and only allows PhD students to bargain their contract *once* in their entire duration here. In doing this, our new/incoming union members will be inexperienced when it comes to bargaining, as they will have never *seen* a bargaining session before- OSU will take advantage of this, and use our inexperience with bargaining to pass whatever contracts they want.

These are just two things we are fighting for. For deeper insight I encourage you to check out the union's [website ](https://www.cge6069.org/)and follow the union on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cge6069/). **OSU has made it clear that their goal is to spread misinformation, fear-monger, and weaponize undergraduates against us with misleading data and blatant lies.** Because of this, I personally recommend receiving all strike-related updates directly from the graduate union at the mentioned links.

Additionally, **you are NOT required to use the Canvas form to report your TAs for striking.** This is OSU's way of using YOU to do THEIR job. It's their job to determine who is striking, NOT YOURS. Using the Canvas form is considered actively crossing our picket line, as is covering our shifts/classes as an undergraduate employee. **Any time you help OSU, you are actively hurting us.**

**If you are interested in supporting your TAs during strike, here is a list of some things you can do:**

**-** Sign the [Undergraduate Support Letter](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/letter-of-support-for-coalition-of-graduate-employee-strike?source=direct_link&)

\- Refuse to report absent TAs via the Canvas link

\- Refrain from purchasing food, drinks, and other goods from OSU dining halls and cafes (if you have the means to do so)

\- Refuse to take on the responsibilities of striking grad students (primarily for undergraduate employees)- reminder that **covering for a striking TA is actively crossing the picket line**

\- Spread the word! Send your friends the Support Letter, share the Instagram page, make your voices heard!

\- **Join us on the picket line during your free time!** We meet at 10am daily and picket at the MU until 4pm.

\- There is also a [Faculty Support Letter](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/an-open-letter-from-the-faculty-at-oregon-state-university?source=direct_link&) if you know of faculty who want to pledge support to striking grad workers.

\- Share the [Strike Fund](https://account.venmo.com/u/CGE-OSU?catchAll=u&catchAll=CGE-OSU) and donate if you have the means to do so! Striking grads are not getting paid during this time; many of us need to afford rent, bills, groceries, child care, etc. Any donation is MUCH appreciated!

**TL,DR: OSU is actively spreading misinformation and trying to get YOU to do THEIR work. Their contract proposal will lock graduate workers into a lengthy and unfair contract that forces us into poverty and submission. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THAT and YOU shouldn't either! Spread the word, stay informed, and stand in SOLIDARITY with your TAs!**

So here it goes.

I sincerely apologize for how disorganized this subreddit has become. To put it bluntly, I have no clue who all is moderating this subreddit other than myself currently. I thought there were others, but the two mods I knew both left their mod positions and told me to figure out what to do. I‚Äôm really sorry about the state of some things on this subreddit recently. I have been doing my best to respond to any mod queue items I see, both to ensure rules are being followed but also to try to make sure that the subreddit is not banned for being unmoderated. However, I‚Äôm becoming overwhelmed with it. Additionally, I currently live and work on the other side of the planet and don‚Äôt think it makes any sense for me to be a mod here any longer. I am going to try to find out who else is a mod currently, as I don‚Äôt think everyone who is assigned as a mod actually manages this subreddit currently. 

Over the next couple weeks I will look into that, then sometime during winter break I will make a post about how to apply to be a mod. So I just ask for your patience until then.

As for the graduate student strike, I can assure that posts regarding the strike are not being removed by myself unless there are good reasons for it (i.e. if they break a subreddit rule). In fact, I am a previous PhD candidate at OSU and would have been joining in the strike as well if I were still a student there. However, based on the mod reports, it appears the Automod has been running rampant lately and removing posts, so I apologize for that. I will do my best to catch those in the meantime now that I know it is happening. 

And finally, thanks for being such a wonderful community (well, most of you are at least)! For the grad students out there, I wish you all the bust of luck on the strike and for all the students I hope your finals go well!"

(Edit: if this reaches like 10-15 upvotes I'll start the Club)  
(Edit 2:The application has been submitted, wish me luck on seeing if it's accepted)  
(edit 3: There's now a discord server that has been made for the cheese club you can find it easily by sorting comments to newest, , we still need 2 officers as well, so once at least 20 people join it we will do a voting process to decide the officers of the club.)

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/oregon-state) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking. Also, since some courses depend on the professor, you can filter the reviews by professors and it will show you the average ratings for each professor.
Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.  (to leave a review, just search your course and you can submit a review at the bottom of the page)


Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

Enjoy!!"

I got hired in under the guise of receiving training and a permanent position, but that was farther than the truth. What they really wanted is someone who would be their pack mule that they can offload any and all menial tasks they didn‚Äôt want to do.
They terminated my employment without warning or coaching, and left me without any time to find a new job. On top of that, they fired the Maintenance lead several days prior, so if y‚Äôall wandering why they are horrible at maintenance requests, it‚Äôs probably due to high turn over rate! 
If anyone was wandering, they‚Äôre as corporate and scummy when dealing with their employees as they are when they do external business with their tenants and future prospects. Anymore reason not to deal with them."

Especially don't leave a bag visible, even if it just has some notebooks or gym clothes in it. In that case, the backpack that gets stolen will cost less than replacing your smashed window! 

Every time you leave your car, think ‚Äî if everything in here was stolen right now, how would I feel? You should be comfortable leaving your car unlocked. Don't do that though, I've seen people cruise around pulling on car doors to see if they can steal a stereo...but that's the mindset you should have about valuables in your car.

He saw me on my bike talking to the cops when he got arrested. Today I find my bike completely vandalized. The cable lock for my wheels was cut and the wheels were stolen. seat slashed. cables cut. phone mount smashed. paint gouged. The other bikes on the rack were fine, it was targeted. I made a report. Even though It was outside a major residence hall there were no cameras.  It's insane how brazen the tweakers are here, I've had them smash into my friend's car just a block off campus during a game. I'm tired of seeing vagrants scouting the bike racks on campus and seeing mountains of bikes next to trash nests down by the dog park, both of which tell me that the issue is not being addressed and I am far from alone. I am sympathetic to the struggles of homelessness and addiction to what most people would consider a radical degree but I am not sympathetic to people who prey on people. I've had people in my life deal with homelessness and addiction and by their account they hated dealing with the tweakers more than I do.

I know the real fix is a societal solution at a larger scale but at the least, I'd love some added security; a bike room or a locker would be great but that's not available in my hall or most halls.

I just published a [Chrome Web Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osu-rate-my-professor-ext/hgfogfefocfabnfjmjijfcjogeghmocn) that aims to ease your class browsing experience by directly displaying Rate My Professors reviews on OSU's class registration page. If you already use the Rate My Professors website when registering for classes, this extension will save you a lot of time.

It's simple to use! Here is a demonstration:

[Demo](https://reddit.com/link/15ihg3c/video/ivauljaes6gb1/player)

I am actively updating this extension, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know in the reply section! If you find this helpful, please consider supporting me by leaving a review.

Also, here is a link to the [source code](https://github.com/sebat2004/osu-rmp-extension) for anyone interested.

Edit: Rate My Professor reviews aren't always accurate, so take them with a grain of salt. I've found that positive reviews are often the most reliable. If you see a professor with good reviews, they're likely a good or excellent professor. The reliability falls off the lower the review because sometimes students let the grade they got in a class influence their opinion of a prof."

The GD program only allows 40 people in per cohort which makes it competitive. Despite how difficult it may be to get in, the program is extremely understaffed and the professors that do teach are heavily under qualified. Most have little to no professional graphic design experience in the field (1 professor only having an Etsy page for therapy based graphics as their only experience). 

Along with that you will also have a single academic advisor who will actively register you into the wrong classes and will provide you with little to no help on your route to graduate. I have gone to student advocacy multiple times to report this academic advisor but to no help as he has quite a veteran status within OSU. He also initially lied to me about the program promising future animation classes later in the junior-senior year of program, which was not true (I was transferring with an associates in animation, at the time) and pushed the major onto me, for what I assume is my out-of-state tuition. 

So why am I writing this? Mostly, I‚Äôm upset that I spent the last 4 years paying to learn and walking out learning nothing. It‚Äôs also worth to note that your credits for Graphic Design will not transfer to any school outside of OSU as it is a cohort, linear 4 year program. So once you‚Äôre in, there‚Äôs no going out unless you wish to fully restart at another university. This stopped me from moving back home (all of the GD classes must be attended in person) and prevented me from transferring universities.

I‚Äôve always been frustrated with OSU and with the graphic design program. But now that I‚Äôm out and have started my first job in the field I‚Äôm truly starting to realize how little this university and program taught me. I hope no one gets caught in this same trap."

Several of my colleagues and I have written an open letter, which we intend to send to Oregon's congressional delegation. If you want to sign it, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/jeiLHcGVQD4brsPY8).

([Link to letter in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dc_LmI_VneR4g-vTE5HOGrNRcBdV1RjGg5bipU-S0Yk/edit))

&#x200B;

*To: Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley; Representatives Suzanne Bonamici, Cliff Bentz, Earl Blumenauer, Peter DeFazio, and Kurt Schrader.*

*Dear Members of Oregon's Congressional Delegation:*

*Please ask your colleagues in Congress to stop introducing and voting for bills that:*

1. *Will increase computer and internet-based surveillance in the United States.*
2. *Undermine encryption, the bedrock of privacy and autonomy in our era.*

*The most recent example of such a bill is the EARN IT Act, which is currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee and other committees in the House. We urge you to vigorously stand against this bill.*

*It is our view that bills which enlarge the surveillance state of America's digital landscape or strip individuals of the tools to protect themselves in this landscape are ill conceived. EARN IT is one such bill. Among other concerns, these types of bills:*

* *Are impossible to implement or enforce, from a technical perspective.*
* *Criminalize ordinary and law abiding behavior, or sets the groundwork to do so.*
* *Violate the spirit motivating, and letter of, various Constitutional tenets that safeguard cherished and inviolable civil liberties.*

*We, the undersigned, are computer scientists. We can attest to the laborious and ultimately futile effort of curtailing encryption. Regardless of the merits (or lack thereof) of the public policy rationale for undermining encryption, the one charged with carrying out any mandate to enact anti-encryption legislation is charged with the job of Sisyphus on a digital hill. The task of implementing law or software to circumvent encryption will always end in vain in the long run, but the damage that will be done with every failed attempt to succeed will be very real.*

*Surveillance and anti-encryption pushes are often proposed under the auspices of real or imagined threat. In the particular case of EARN IT, the articulated threat comes from perpetrators of online child pornography. An enacted EARN IT Act, if not de-facto banning encryption, will create a chilling effect on the use of encryption. The ironic result will be a decrease of children‚Äôs online safety by making it more difficult to safeguard their data, along with everyone else's data, from unwanted attackers and snoopers. Anti-encryption laws serve only to make vulnerable the law abiding and embolden the predatory.*

*We affirm that technology which protects or empowers the many must never be stripped away from a free people because of the abusive actions of a few, no matter how abhorrent or heinous the abuse of that technology may be. Civil liberties of the digital world may not yet be enumerated in our nation's highest laws in plain text, nor fully vitalized by the nation's courts from the penumbras of well established offline legal doctrine. Yet these rights and liberties of the digital world are very much extant and inalienable, regardless of their recognition by the congress, the executive, the judiciary, or the tech titans of the day. Mass surveillance and anti-encryption movements desecrate these liberties.*

*We, the undersigned, are digital natives. We have lived with technology, developed it, and have an intimate understanding of its uses; we have seen technology bring out the best of humanity, and the worst. The world that will result from the enactment of bills like EARN IT is not the world we wish to live in, now nor ever. We believe that passing this bill, and others like it, will not only undermine individual freedom, but will also have disastrous collective consequences. Attacks on encryption, and an expansion of mass surveillance, are moves one would expect to find in an outpost of tyranny, not in a mature democratic republic, and certainly not in the United States of America.*

*We thank you for your longstanding interest in these issues. Please, stop this bill and others like it at all costs.*

*Sincerely,*

*\[Long list of signatures, including 40+ faculty and graduate students in computer science at nine of Oregon's universities.\]*

180chzt,Game Experience (Recap from Neutral Fan),76,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonStateUniv/comments/180chzt/game_experience_recap_from_neutral_fan/,11,2023-11-21 08:40:00+00:00,Gators5220,"Apologies if creating a new post instead of adding to [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonStateUniv/comments/17uvrza/visiting_for_washington_game_neutral_fan_am_i/) from a few days ago is frowned upon, but I wanted to express my gratitude for all the tips in that thread and for the great hospitality I received on my trip. Here's an extremely long recap of my experience:

1. I attended the Colorado-Wazzu game Friday night, then drove back to Spokane right after the game. I had an early flight with a stopover in Seattle that was supposed to get me to Portland at 9am, so I was hoping to be in Corvallis by 11-11:30am after picking up the rental car and driving down from PDX. I had it all mapped out: I'd grab an early lunch at Local Boyz, grab a drink or four at Bombs Away, and then walk over to a tailgate that /u/Big_Box_O_Shine had invited me to attend. The Beavs would win, then I'd celebrate at Clod's, Peacock, or wherever else the night took me. But then...

2. My flight to Seattle took off on time and arrived as schedule. However, as we landed through fairly heavy fog, I actually thought to myself, ""Hmm, I wonder how they decide *how much* fog is too much to land through."" As it turns out, the answer was the thickness of the fog about 2 minutes after we landed. The Seattle airport apparently issued a ground stop due to the fog, so no flights were taking off or landing and I was stranded until the fog cleared. Once it did finally clear a couple of hours later, we had to wait for the actual aircraft to arrive from Portland so that we could take it right back to PDX. By the time all that occurred, my flight took off from Seattle over 4 hours after its scheduled departure time.

3. I finally landed in Portland around 1:30pm and was able to quickly get my rental car and make it to Corvallis around 3:30pm. I parked and headed immediately to the previously mentioned tailgate, where /u/Big_Box_O_Shine and his crew were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and fun. In order to make up for lost time, we (I, mostly) took shots -- oh, so many shots -- and crammed about 3-4 hours worth of drinking into 30 minutes while getting acquainted, talking football travels, and discussing the upcoming game. Spirits were high.

4. We walked over to the stadium and made it in time for kickoff, but I obviously missed all the pregame band festivities outside the stadium and only caught the tail end of the pregame on-field performance, which was a bummer.

5. Despite the cold and the rain, the atmosphere in the stadium was pretty damn electric IMO. Third downs were loud -- not just the chainsaw sound being piped in, but the crowd obviously disrupting Penix and the Washington offense at times. The student section was active all night, with their hard hats continuously bobbing up and down. I mean, the atmosphere was strong enough that it made a Southern boy forget that he was freezing cold and soaking wet, and instead focus on the fun of a Top-10 Pac-12 After Dark matchup in a great environment. That's a pretty high bar to clear. I also moved around a fair amount to experience the stadium from different spots, and every Beaver fan I met was friendly and enthusiastic. Fantastic fan base.

6. As for the stadium itself, obviously I have no previous experience to go on. I don't know if I would've preferred the nostalgia of its previous form by comparison, but seeing it for the first time as-is, I found it largely well-designed, attractive, and modern. Having walked around the entirety of the stadium (inside and out), I imagine recruits would find it impressive, as well. The size seemed perfectly suited for Corvallis and OSU -- large enough to create a fun, loud environment that exuded a big-time college football vibe, but not overbuilt for the size of the school and town.

7. The only area where I think the stadium comes up a bit short is bathroom availability. Considering the width of the concourses and placement of the stairwell/escalators, it seems like they probably could've budgeted a bit more space for restrooms, but I'm not an architect, so what do I know? Either way, it was still a relatively minor inconvenience in a stadium I still thought was fantastic.

8. As an unabashed lover of stadium singalongs and silly CFB things in general, I loved when ""Party in the USA"" was played over the PA. It was a random bit of fun in an otherwise intense game, with even the Husky fans around me getting into it. Then as soon as it was over, it was back to yelling and screaming when the Huskies had the ball. Loved it.

9. I really thought the Beavs had it. That last drive was going perfectly. Slowly matriculating the ball down the field, burning off clock with each first down. I had this vision in my head of 3 more first downs and a walk-off FG to win it. But then that 2nd & 12 throw down the sideline baffled me. At a point when OSU was moving the ball in small chunks pretty consistently, there was plenty of time left, and all 4 downs were gonna be used no matter what, I didn't understand the reasoning behind taking a low-percentage shot downfield. It basically took an extra down away and put all the pressure on getting 6+ each of the next two downs. It also made me sick to my stomach to look back and realize that a safety on an airmailed punt snap in a downpour was the difference in a game where Oregon State largely outplayed Washington. Tough loss.

10. After the game, I headed back to the same tailgate and commiserated over beers. I can't say enough about those fine folks. Not only were they extraordinarily welcoming and incredibly fun to hang out with, but their passion for the sport and for the Beavs was readily apparent. They are so passionate about their alma mater and have celebrated that passion for so long that it's impossible not to want to root alongside them.

11. When we got to talking about what's next due to conference realignment and all the issues it presents, it made my heart sink for both Oregon State and Wazzu. I changed plans and made this trip because I wanted to see both schools in person before the Pac-12 crumbles. Having now done so, it seems even more unfair and stupid and rage-inducing than it did from afar. Look, I've been to games between teams from the Sun Belt, MAC, AAC, etc. While I have a deep respect for those schools, appreciate the role they play in CFB, and love spending my fall weeknights watching their games on TV, it's just a different tier of football. I've also visited the vast majority of the Power 5 schools, so I have a massive baseline for comparison. There's no doubt -- **ZERO, ABSOLUTELY NONE** -- that Oregon State and Washington State belong in the upper tier. It sucks that schools like UCLA that already have the location, resources, historic stadiums, etc. and still can't cultivate a passionate fanbase get an express pass to the mega-money while y'all get screwed. There's no other way to say it; it just sucks.

12. After helping pack up the tailgate, I headed back to my car around 10pm. Once I got there, I realized my key fob had disappeared and spent the next 20 minutes in panic mode. I hustled back to the tailgate spot and fortunately the key was right at the edge of the parking spot where the equipment truck had been. It must have fallen out of my jacket pocket while loading stuff up. Disaster averted.

13. However, due to that delay, it was closer to 11pm by the time I got back to my car. I was cold and soaking wet, and due to the late planning of this trip, I couldn't find a place to stay in Corvallis and had to book in Salem instead. I still drove by the Peacock and Clod's to try to talk myself into powering through it, but the lines in front of each were horrendously long at that point, so I settled for a heated car and a stop at Riva's for a late-night bite before heading to the hotel. It was immaculate after a long day, and I can only imagine how much better it would've been if I were considerably drunker. So big thanks to those who commented on the previous post for pointing me in that direction.

14. On Sunday, I slept in a bit, took my time getting ready, and then headed back to Corvallis, arriving a little before noon. Extremely bummed that I missed my chance at Local Boyz because it's closed on Sundays, I grabbed lunch at a nearly empty Bombs Away. I then headed downtown and spent my afternoon slowly sipping beers at Sky High, Treebeerds, and Block 15. Continuing the theme, I again met great folks at each of those places and felt incredibly welcome in Corvallis.

15. After cutting myself off, walking around downtown & along the river, and grabbing some coffee (a rarity for me), I drove back to Portland for my evening flight. Since I had a redeye with a stopover in Salt Lake City, I decided I should probably go ahead and grab supper in Portland before flying out. I stopped by Botto's BBQ, which was recommended by the folks at Texas Monthly, and it did not disappoint. The brisket wasn't quite to the level of Matt's in Portland or some of the top places in Central Texas, but the ribs were spectacular and the two sides I had -- Hatch chili mac & cheese and Brunswick stew -- were also fantastic.

Overall, I had a fantastic time in Corvallis. It was unfortunate that a delayed flight and a slippery key fob limited my ability to maximize my time in town, but between my ill-fated trip for the Montana State game and the game experience of this one, it's almost like I've taken two half-trips that equal a whole. With that said, I think Corvallis is a great college town, so I would still like to come back at some point for a full weekend trip -- get in by lunchtime on Friday, have plenty of time to explore, take in the the Friday nightlife, tailgate all day, see some of the pregame festivities I missed, and eat my way around town (I can't believe I'm 0-2 on Local Boyz) before heading home. Meeting incredible folks like /u/Big_Box_O_Shine only solidified that desire, so huge thanks to him and his crew for being such great hosts.

Anyway, sorry for the obnoxiously long post. Again, my sincere thanks to all of y'all for the tips and the hospitality I was shown.

One last thing: I've been traveling all around the country for games since 2018, but this season I finally caved to my friends' encouragement and have begun sharing some of my travels publicly. So if you'd like to see pics, videos, etc., I've posted a long ""story highlight"" to my Instagram page (@cfbtravelguy), plus will be posting several Reels from the game when I've got some time to do some editing. I also post some videos on TikTok (@cfb.travel.guy) and plan to put together lengthier trip reviews -- basically this post, but in video form with some additional commentary and clips from my trip -- on YouTube (@cfbtravelguy) after the season when I've got some spare time. 

Feel free to check that stuff out, and if you have questions about other places I've been, don't hesitate to ask.

Thanks again!"

The mismanagement of C parking is getting atrocious. I'm sure if you're in reser driving around for your 8-11 am classes you'll see everyone driving in circles and following people to there cars. This is not fair, and has resulted in people being late for classes or giving up and not attending (including myself)

Reser/ C parking is being oversold on top of giving spots to visitors for events and construction workers. We paid $100+ for our passes to not even be able to get a spot sometimes. I'm sure we signed something when we bought the pass of ""you aren't guaranteed a spot,"" but this shouldn't be a near everyday occurance. When plane tickets are oversold, alternatives are offered. We aren't even told when spots are roped off and are unavailable until we show up.

From 11/1-11/10 the back row of the side of reser along western and 26th is roped off. This is about 20 spots, not including the numerous spots in the line connecting the two lots that are blocked off due to poor pavement. 

This is just getting quite frustrating. As a student who has already paid tens of thousands of dollars to OSU on top of the parking pass, I feel it is ridiculous that I can't even attend classes sometimes because there isn't enough available parking due to construction that I at least know I didn't consent to. Our tuition is being used to build reser, which I didn't agree to, especially knowing I wouldn't be able to park easily most days. 

I think we should be informed on at least a weekly basis through email the status of parking ability based on events or temporary roping off of spots. I feel we should be allowed to park in other lots on some days.

I would love to hear what you all think. This feels classist to treat the cheapest parking pass so poorly. I can't afford to spend more than $200 on parking with the high cost of tuition."

Wade in from a shallow area for 5 minutes. This gives your body time to adjust and minimizes the risk of the initial shock response, which is the most dangerous part.

[A study on the physiology of cold water immersion (cold = 50-60 F)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730683/)

>The lungs contract in the first few seconds followed by uncontrollable hyperventilating and loss of breathing control [79]. The heart rate, and blood pressure and cardiac output increase with simultaneous peripheral vasoconstriction [4,80]. The dynamic response is initiated by peripheral cold receptors, peaking approximately 30 seconds after exposure and adapting over about two minutes [81]. The initial shock and loss of breathing control is where the swimmer is at greatest risk of drowning and death is it requires very little aspirated water to initiate the drowning process [82]. Experienced winter swimmers become more resistant to the cold shock reaction through conditioning and progressive adaptation of the body to the cold regularly and with increasing frequency and gradual lowering of temperatures [83]. It is crucial to adapt and acclimatize to the initial shock response as it is particularly hazardous, accounting for the majority of cold water immersion deaths [75]."
