Everyone knows BYU housing has problems, but it‚Äôs time we have a real discussion about the root causes.

Here are a few excerpts from ‚ÄúThe Provo Housing Racket‚Äù that summarize our findings pretty succinctly:

‚Äî

Too often, BYU students are over-charged, abused, and taken advantage of by their landlords. And, despite good intentions, BYU is one of the greatest culprits behind Provo‚Äôs broken student housing market.

BYU places significant hurdles in the way of would-be landlords, limiting the supply of available housing and costing students more. First, BYU contracted apartments are required to physically segregate male and female designated units. Since most apartments in the U.S. are gender-neutral by default, a large chunk of housing is written-off on that basis alone. Second, BYU contracted apartments must be located within a certain distance of campus, limiting the geography for BYU housing to a mere 2.7 square miles. That area includes established businesses and married housing, as well as streets and greenspace.

As a result, many BYU apartments are thirty, forty, even fifty years old. Building new is expensive, and the pool of non-BYU contracted housing within the zone is limited. Most newer developments are on the premium side of the market (The Village, College Place, etc.). If students had a wider range of affordable options to choose from, rent would fall and quality would rise.

It‚Äôs bad enough that BYU has built a system primed for exploitation‚Äîa system where the rules of supply and demand no longer apply, and landlords can count on a captive audience of vulnerable renters. What‚Äôs worse is the way that BYU has abandoned its responsibility to protect students. Last winter, BYU moved classes online and told students to go home. Students on-campus were released from their contracts in the dorms without penalties. Students off-campus, however, were left to fend for themselves. BYU did little to pressure complexes to release students from contracts, even though the university could have threatened to rescind BYU approval for non-compliant housing. 

If BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing with all of the drawbacks that entails‚Äîspecial rules, higher rents, lower quality‚ÄîBYU needs to do more to protect students. This means:

No more 12-month contracts: require complexes to offer fall/winter contracts since most students leave Provo in April. 

No more monopolies: limit the reach of companies like Redstone Residential that exercise unfair control over the housing market.

Finally, pick sides: when crises like COVID-19 break out, BYU needs to side with students. The university has played neutral for far too long.

Or better yet, BYU should let students live where they want and let the problems work themselves out."

First of all I've done this previously now and if you are like most rookies you will NOT make the money they tell you, you will make. Remember these guys are salesman and will really persuade you to give it a try and not listen to others who are viewing as a negative experience.




The way it works is you sell pest control contracts d2d (door to door) they are usually for 1-year and will average a contract value of for example $520. You as a salesman will get a % and usually they start rookies out at 25% (which is terrible by the way) so that's $130 in commissions per sale you will make. The recruiter will sell you this idea you can make $20,000, $40,000, $100,000 in one summer. **Reality is 99% will NOT.** It's a very hard industry you are knocking door to door 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.



Now that I get out of the way how it works, Let me show you the realty of it and not only MY experience but experience with other friends and coworkers and how we all get screwed and YOU will too.



So they will most likely give you a % of 25%, 30% or maybe even a little higher. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't sell and service over 100 accounts or sometimes even 150 accounts you will get a low flat percentage of 18%. This will cost you thousands of dollars. For example if you go out and work your butt off and you finish the summer with 95 accounts serviced. ($520x95accounts = $49,400(18%) you are only making $8,892 this is not including rent, groceries, gas, entertainment, etc. so you will make a LOT less than you would staying home with your parents working for $8-$15/hour. Since they prey on college students or returned missionaries from the LDS church.That is ONLY ONE WAY they will try and screw you over.



Another way is if you do happen to go against their favor and you do service over 100 or 150 accounts I've had friends I worked with who didn't even get their commission checks. So the way it works is during the summer you will get only $50 upfront for each serviced accounts and the rest of the commission you will get in the ""backend"" (rest of commission checks later in the year, 2 of them) which usually payout a few months later in November, and January. I've had friends who are out there busting all hot summer for 3-4 months to end up not getting anything. There recruiter will lie and say some of there accounts canceled and it fell below the 150 or 100 accounts serviced. To put in perspective let's say you sold and serviced 150 accounts and you get your $50 for each one ($50x150= $7,500 during the summer) with expectations you are going to get a $15,900 after the summer only to come to find out your recruiter kept all your money then will lie to you that some of your accounts weren't legit or they canceled. Keeping $15,900 of your earned money.

**I had a friend who sold and serviced 198 accounts..** and signed a 35% commission plan, which would of been like $36,000+ he would made (since I don't remember his average contract value) **he ended making only $9,900** ($50 upfront per sale x 198accounts = $9,900) and his recruiter would end up keeping $41,100+ (I figured this since if he only got paid it $9,900 that would be only 10% since he didn't get his backend checks. Since the recruiter can recruit someone and give them a commission deal the recruiter will make the difference of 50%, for example 50%-10%(whatever number they sign a recruit at) = 40% recruiter keeps) we will say he averaged a contract value of $520 x 198accounts = $102,960 revenue (40% recruiter keeps if they screw you over) Recruiter keeps $41,000 and this is how they make their money my screwing over multiple recruits and obviously wanting a couple of them to succeed because they will make override commissions of that recruit but also any recruits they bring on to the team the following summers, almost like a pyramid.


**DON'T sell door-to-door pest control**, 99% of the time they will screw you over. They are not in the industry to make it into a career, they are in it to recruit and have unexperienced and uneducated first year reps make their money year after year. Please spread the word and share this post with people who are thinking about doing it. This is how your recruiter is able to afford all the stuff they are showing off to you. (cars, trucks, clothes, gadgets, toys, lifestyle, travelling, etc.) You will be working 12 hour days, 6 days a week to make money for their pockets and since you're a 1099 ""employee"" that signed some pathetic agreement they can get away with this. You should really avoid any sales recruiter If you have any questions comment below or message me. I got screenshots of my previous agreement commission plan and screenshots how I got screwed over and I sold over the 150 amount.  


If you have any experiences similar or know of anyone who this happened to post below. Let's make it aware for others before going out and wasting their summer since some of us have tuition bills to pay, families to support, etc.

**To add:** Aptive and it‚Äôs recruiters/team leaders really do be trying to set you up for failure or set the odds against you however you want to look at it. Because they have control on what they put down on the agreement you sign for example.

- 18% if you don‚Äôt service over 150 accounts
- 18% if you switch to a technician (but in reality you won‚Äôt get any of it)
- they keep ALL your money if you leave home early (over 60% of reps do)
- if you don‚Äôt service a minimum of 6 accounts/week you will get written up then fired if it happens again, resulting in your recruiter keeping ALL your money (recruiters will say this is in both our best interest because we don‚Äôt want you to be out here if you‚Äôre not selling, but just imagine if you have to take a few days off for a wedding or you get sick.. lol)
- if you go home even a day early from the dates you told them on paper, written you are voiding your contract and they can keep all your money. Even if they say ‚Äútalk to us and we‚Äôre understanding‚Äù don‚Äôt believe it, only what‚Äôs in writing actually is true. Had it happen to a buddy who went home only 2 days early from his end date and kept ALL his money..


Still think I‚Äôm only talking about my experience and a personal few other people I know, or maybe that I‚Äôm not a good sales rep? Lol If you got time read this:

Since transferring isn't really an option for me, I plan on being more open with my gender identity at BYU, and I've already came out to my bishop and a number of professors. Everyone has been pretty supportive so far, which I was not expecting.

Anyway, I wanted to get my ID card updated to reflect my new name and gender presentation. I was a bit hesitant, since I've heard quite a few cautionary tales of LGBT students and the Honor Code Office. I ended up emailing the ID center to verify that what I was doing was kosher.

It turns out that the ID center was totally cool with putting my preferred name on my card and dressing in feminine clothing for my picture. The person I emailed even asked what pronouns I wanted used for me so that when I went in I wouldn't get misgendered. So that turned out really well. Getting the ID card updated was pretty easy too, I simply walked in, took the picture, got my card, and left no questions asked.

In summary, while BYU can still be a tricky place for LGBT students to navigate, things are getting much better for us on campus. If you're a transgender student on campus, you should definitely still weigh the pros and cons of coming out of the closet. I just want y'all to know that (in my experience) the ID center is pretty trans friendly."
em3vln,My experience meeting with an Associate Dean of Students about the beard policy,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/em3vln/my_experience_meeting_with_an_associate_dean_of/,19,2020-01-09 03:26:15+00:00,None,"Hey everyone, I'm a sophomore at BYU who thinks he looks way better with a beard, and my wife and friends agree. So I let my facial hair grow and shave before tests. I hate doing this, because I want to let my beard grow out, so a couple weeks ago I met with the Associate Dean of Students Nathan Ward to discuss the issue of beards.

A quick summary of our meeting: that sucks, there's nothing I or you can do, have an ice cream on us.

In all honesty, my meeting with Dean Ward was very cordial and respectful. I went in knowing that people would have spoken with him before and intended on getting some ideas on official ways I can go about appealing it to people in power. And that's where I hit a brick wall. While I got the feeling throughout the meeting that Dean Ward was on my side and in total agreement, he explained to me in no uncertain terms that there's no way for me to directly contact those in charge of the Dress and Grooming Standards.

He also explained to me who's in charge of them: the First Presidency, Twelve, and a handful of other commissioners who meet to talk about the entire CES once a month. He told me that they were aware of the issues and that they were aware that student sentiment had changed. I asked if he could bring it up, he said that while they do talk about student sentiment about many rules that not even President Worthen can make recommendations on changes to the Honor Code: only the board can ask for recommendations. ie the prophet, his counselors, and 3 or 4 other people. The last time they asked for recommendations? 1991.

I asked him if he could see the policy changing while I'm at BYU (two-ish more years), he said he wouldn't be surprised, but that I shouldn't hold my breath.

After 45 minutes of discussion, I said ""it appears we've hit a brick wall."" Dean Ward chuckled sympathetically, and as a well-intentioned final act of placation, gave me two coupons for free ice cream from Cougar Eats, which I enjoyed with my wife.

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah, we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County, particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We‚Äôre concerned not only for your well-being, but also for those in the local community who are affected by the trends we‚Äôve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes, work, church, and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren‚Äôt wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you‚Äôre feeling sick, stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus, may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result, follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks, more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine, closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely,

Kevin J Worthen, BYU President
Astrid S. Tuminez, UVU President"

View Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jw291e/the_problems_with_byu_contracted_housing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

In Part 1, we concluded that one of the biggest drivers behind BYU's broken student housing market is BYU itself. In Part 2, we will examine Redstone Residential and MHE Real Estate as a case study on the greater Provo student housing market. 

\_\_\_

Most students have no idea who their actual landlord is, and unmasking owners can be a lot like taking apart a Russian Nesting Doll‚Äîone shell company after another. Consider the Liberty franchise. According to Utah business records, the Liberty on Freedom complex is owned by Liberty on Freedom (LLC). In turn, Liberty on Freedom (LLC) is owned by Liberty Square West Investors (LLC) and Liberty Square West (LLC). Finally, Liberty Square West (LLC) is managed by **(name redacted to avoid doxxing)**, CEO of MHE Real Estate. A quick look through the MHE Real Estate [website](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/) reveals that MHE is a major player in the Provo housing market, despite the fact that the average renter has never even heard of them.

MHE at least partially owns: Campus Provo, Liberty Square, Liberty on Eighth, and Liberty on Freedom. These are among the largest BYU complexes by bed count. Liberty Square is actually the single largest BYU complex by bed count. 

While MHE owns the apartments, Redstone Residential (a real estate operating company) manages everything from leasing to maintenance and rent collections. In other words: Redstone is essentially a middleman between landlords and renters. Most operating companies take a percentage of revenues, driving up rent and disincentivizing any expensive maintenance or improvements. 

Residents we spoke to at Liberty on Freedom noted aged buildings, shared bedrooms, cramped kitchens, and a single shared bathroom. With utilities, rent comes out to about $400/month.

Before MHE and Redstone, Liberty Square had a vacancy rate of [30-40%](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/liberty-square/) during the summer months due to the nature of fall/winter and spring/summer length contracts. Now, Redstone-managed properties almost exclusively offer 12-month contracts, and vacancy has fallen to nearly zero. The burden has shifted from landlords to renters, and students are left scrambling to find replacement tenants for the summer months even though most BYU students leave Provo in April.

Redstone manages about half of all beds at the large BYU complexes and an even greater share of the overall market. Because BYU has kept the barrier to entry for new landlords so high, many students are forced to choose between one Redstone-managed property or another. And if it's not Redstone, it's likely Aspen Ridge. Small landlords are struggling to compete or even get BYU approval.

When COVID hit, the MHE-owned and Redstone-operated Liberty franchise was generally uncooperative with students trying to be released from their contracts or get rent reductions. Meanwhile, Redstone Residential received [between $2-5m](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/redstone-residential-inc-3cfaf714208b0bbd8de93d67b90a1a92) in forgivable PPP loans. 

When a few large firms monopolize a market, competition falls and consumers are made worse-off. Granting students access to the open market is the best way to promote competition and loosen the hold of companies like Redstone and MHE.

It's time for BYU to step-up and fix the broken housing market they helped create."

fe1v43,I‚Äôm fully aware that this will be an unpopular opinion,93,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/fe1v43/im_fully_aware_that_this_will_be_an_unpopular/,66,2020-03-05 20:51:44+00:00,shadetreepolymath,"There has been a lot of talk about how the BYU community should interact with the LGBTQ community.  Pro-tip: This is not the first time groups of people with different standards have had conflict.  So what‚Äôs the best way to deal with conflict?  Generally, when there is deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement, it‚Äôs helpful to agree to disagree.  

By the way, ‚Äúdeep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement‚Äù is exactly what this is.  This isn‚Äôt Handmaid‚Äôs-Tale-style patriarchy trying to oppress you, and it‚Äôs not a progressive conspiracy to make you gay.  It‚Äôs decent people who genuinely hold one set of values disagreeing with decent people who hold a different set of values.  For the most part.

I have many friends and acquaintances from across the political and social spectrum, and we agree to disagree a lot.  I don‚Äôt love the fact that abortions occur, but I have good friends who are one-issue pro-choice voters.  I don‚Äôt think Islam is the devil‚Äôs scourge, but I go to family reunions with plenty of people who do think that, and I love them dearly.  I think socialism is an atrocious idea, but I haven‚Äôt blocked any of my Bernie-loving friends on social media.  Why?  Because we agree to disagree.  We share our opinions, we exchange ideas, and when the day is over, we shake hands and go back to our corners.

By the way, letting the other side ‚Äúgo back to their corner‚Äù is an essential part of agreeing to disagree.  Even though I‚Äôm pro-life, I‚Äôve never chased an abortion doctor back to his house and picketed his front door.  Because that‚Äôs his house.  Even though I‚Äôm anti-anti-Islam, I‚Äôve never gone inside my cousin‚Äôs rural Baptist church and shouted that everyone needs to stop sending money to Israel and be more open-minded about Islam.  Because that‚Äôs their church.  Even though I‚Äôm pro-gun, I‚Äôve never gone to a meeting of Moms Demand Action with a firearm slung on my shoulder.  Because that‚Äôs their meeting.  Agreeing to disagree means you listen quietly, you state your case, and then you respect the other side‚Äôs autonomy.

In summary --  Even if you think homosexuality is a bad idea, don‚Äôt go to a gay bar and preach at people.  Nobody forced you to go to the gay bar, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave the people in the gar bar alone.  The gar bar doesn‚Äôt exist for you.  And even if you think homosexuality is just fine, don‚Äôt go to BYU and protest.  Nobody forced you to go to BYU, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave BYU alone.  There are plenty of universities that don‚Äôt think there is anything at all wrong with homosexuality.  Like, ALL OF THEM except BYU.  

I‚Äôm NOT saying, ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like BYU's standards, go somewhere else.‚Äù  I‚Äôm saying, if you don‚Äôt like BYU‚Äôs stance on homosexuality, that‚Äôs fine!  Stay if you want to.  It‚Äôs fine that there are communities that you don‚Äôt like.  There are communities that I don‚Äôt like.  We don‚Äôt have to change everybody we disagree with.  Let BYU‚Äôs standards be BYU‚Äôs standards.

Respect the fact that different communities see things differently, and leave them alone to do things differently."
f4g1yn,If you were rejected from BYU today...,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/f4g1yn/if_you_were_rejected_from_byu_today/,14,2020-02-15 21:28:34+00:00,nikond750,"I was rejected from BYU just about two years ago. I was a convert with a 36 and a 4.0 and I was left feeling shocked and very hurt. I attended another university for a semester, reapplied with the exact same application, and was ultimately accepted for Winter 2019. 

College admissions is a really fickle process. I don't know why you were denied (and if my experience holds, you will never receive a reason...) but I do have a firm belief‚Äîbolstered in large part by my rejection experience‚Äîthat God will aid us in making the best of these twists and bumps in our life plans. I'm sure I could be in a fantastic place in my life right now had I been accepted the first time, but I also know that my life would be drastically different without the attributes I refined as I weathered this ""trial,"" the amazing friends and faculty with whom I connected at my other university, and the people I met here at BYU only because I arrived when and how I did.

Unfollow BYU on Instagram for a few months if you have to, but keep doing all of the wonderful things you did in preparation to gain admittance and striving to be the best person you can be. Whether you wind up here in Provo next year or head elsewhere for higher education, I promise you're going to be okay. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to. :)"

Despite following all of BYU's mask and social distancing standards both on- and off-campus, I developed some COVID-like symptoms over the weekend. Per the instructions at [health.byu.edu](https://health.byu.edu) and on the Health Together app, I started self-isolating right away and I called the BYU COVID-19 hotline (801-310-0438). Since it was the weekend, they weren't open, so I left a message and received a call back first thing this morning.

You have to have an appointment to be tested at BYU. When they called me, they gave me several timeframe options during the day. You can either walk up or drive through. Masks are required. I walked since I don't have a car. When I was there this morning, it already seemed pretty busy with a few other people who walked up and 10-15 cars in line waiting to be tested. The whole process took me 5-10 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I left.

There is a tent at the front of the Student Health Center where you give them your name to check in. They took my temperature, and after waiting for a few minutes, one of the doctors administered the test. Yes, it involves sticking a q-tip type thing far up your nose, but at least for me, it wasn't painful and just tickled. They told me I should expect to get a phone call with the test results on Wednesday.

I'd imagine things will only get busier as the semester continues, so it's probably best to be proactive about getting tested even if you start experiencing even the slightest symptoms. I hope everybody stays safe!"

I've been at BYU for the past 6 years earning my BS and MS. I was supposed to continue on and do a PhD, but instead I'm leaving academia to work full-time. Why? Because I lost my faith.

I won't go into details about why I'm leaving the church, but let me assure you it was a painful journey and one that I did not choose. I learned some things that fundamentally changed my understanding of the church, and after a year of praying and studying and hoping I realized I could never go back to feeling the way I once did about Joseph Smith or the current church leadership. I have no hard feelings towards the members I've known and loved throughout my life, but Mormonism just isn't for me anymore.

The hardest part of leaving the church has been deciding to leave BYU, as that has permanantly changed my career trajectory. I would absolutely stay here if I felt like I could. I'd be happy to quietly resign from the church and continue living the honor code, but as per the university's Student Standing Policy ([https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy)) that would disqualify me from an ecclesiastical endorsement. I could fake being active to keep my ecclesiastical endorsement, but I'm not willing to submit myself to that bishop's roulette game any longer than I already have. I feel like I've been forced out of my community because of something outside of my control.

In the past few years I have contributed a lot to this university. I've helped hundreds of students as a TA. I've led research projects that have brought recognition and funding to my department. I've mentored almost every new research assistant that has entered my advisor's lab. I've taught classes and presented published research at conferences. And I would have continued to do the same things for the next three+ years if BYU let me. I believe this school would have been better off with me than without me.

I'm not particularly angry about the situation. I'm going to a great job, and now that I've made my decision I'm excited for the change. But I really feel that by forcing people like me out - people who unwillingly lose their faith - BYU is shooting itself in the foot. Sure, there is a risk that former members might actively detract from the spiritual beliefs of their classmates, but BYU already has other policies in place to prevent that. I hope they reconsider their policy and start treating former church members the same as other non-members.¬†

The stated goal of the Honor Code is to encourage campus community members to ""conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and...to maintain the highest standards in their personal conduct regarding honor, integrity, morality, and consideration of others"". I believe I can do that outside of the church just as easily as I did it in the church. In fact, it is my honor and integrity that demands I leave the church, and it's my consideration to others that demands I not work to actively lead others out of it.

I'll miss being part of this community, and I think that this community will miss me."

The presenters said that the honor code first began as a grassroots effort, initiated by the student body, to promote a higher moral standard of conduct amongst the students living on campus. However, as I have progressed through my time at BYU, I am not sure if I have ever encountered any student who particularly likes the honor code. At least every student I've met seems to think that some aspects of the honor code need to be altered if not discarded altogether. 

While the honor code may have represented a grassroots student movement from the class of 1948 (when the honor code was endorsed), it no longer seems to represent the values or opinions of the student body. For that reason, it seems somewhat facetious to pitch the honor code to new students as a body of stipulations that is presently accepted by the student body.

I am curious to hear other opinions though. What are your thoughts on the honor code? Do you perceive that the majority of students like it or dislike it? Do you feel like it is time to implement any changes? If so, of what sort?"

Theory: BYU told the professors to give everyone more hw under COVID precautions.

My guesses why: 

A) To make us feel like we are still getting our money's worth in spite of less in-person interaction.

B) To keep us stationary. If you are busy doing hw all the time, you'd think people would be less likely to move places, go on dates, hang out with friends, etc. Could this be a bit of...um...encouragement (cough* manipulation*) to comply with COVID precautions?"

Additionally, instead of 30 people pulling books off the shelves at once, there‚Äôs about 8. This increases the amount of time people spend in the bookstore; an enclosed, indoor area; increasing exposure risk.

It‚Äôs a great institution and I feel privileged to be here.

My main concern is that I virtually have no desire to attend church anymore. Ever since my mission my testimony has steadily declined and now I‚Äôm not sure I really believe anymore. When I attend church services I feel empty and disingenuous. I don‚Äôt want to transfer schools because I worked so hard to get here and I love it here. But I‚Äôm worried about the honor code since I don‚Äôt attend down here. My family lives an hour away so I enjoy spending weekends with them when I can. I occasionally attend church with them. 

I really want to be a good person and serve others. I want to minister to others and help bring about Zion. I figure the church is a great way to do that, but each time I attend I leave feeling sadder and more discouraged.

I still pay my tithing diligently so I‚Äôm not free-loading (as much) on my subsidized tuition. Does anyone have any advice or insight?

EDIT: just to clarify, I am living every other aspect of the honor code. I feel sad and discouraged because my participation in the church for the most part has been to placate my parents (they have sacrificed a lot for me and my inactivity would make them feel like they have failed or that I am rebelling against them). This brings me sadness at church because I feel that on some level I‚Äôll probably never have that child-like faith again and that now I‚Äôm attending for the wrong reasons."
