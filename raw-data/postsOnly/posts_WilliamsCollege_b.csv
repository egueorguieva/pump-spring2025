However, I'm concerned that the CS program simply lacks the depth and rigor that someone with a definite sense that CS is what they want to study would look for—I worry I'd run out of courses in areas of CS that interested me pretty quickly or they wouldn't be available and I'd be forced to turn to research/independent study or take less interesting math/CS courses.

Some other unis have limits of twice or thrice that standard, so I'm thinking to what extent I have to limit myself (I have about 1,000 words now) for the AOs to read it whole and be positively impacted, not annoyed.

p90047,ED Dilemma: Williams College vs. Dartmouth College,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/p90047/ed_dilemma_williams_college_vs_dartmouth_college/,2,2021-08-21 21:47:28+00:00,LethalVenom1,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I'm a rising high school senior that is applying to colleges this fall. I've narrowed down my ED schools to Williams and Dartmouth and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding between the two schools. I would appreciate any insight that students had that would help me decide. For reference, I will most likely want to study Economics and do something with math, whether that be either doing a double major or getting a minor in math. I will also be cross-posting this to both r/WilliamsCollege and r/dartmouth to get as much input as possible from current students or alumni.

&#x200B;

In terms of the quality of education, I have heard good things about both schools, especially in regards to their econ departments as they are very popular at both colleges. I think the math department at Williams is quite a bit stronger than Dartmouth's, though. Moreover, both schools say they're ""undergraduate-focused"" but I think this is more true of Williams where classes are smaller than Dartmouth and fewer students are competing for research positions and stuff like that especially in a major as popular as econ. Some Wiliams students I have talked to said they even chose Williams over HYPSM because of this and said that Williams has the best quality of education in the world. Does Dartmouth compare? Also, Williams has the Oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.

&#x200B;

The Alumni network also matters to me a lot since I am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. I've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. However, Dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from Dartmouth than Williams. While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in. I don't really know which is better, but I would say maybe Dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but I would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each school.

&#x200B;

This is kinda unique to Dartmouth but I don't know whether the D-Plan is on net good or bad. I've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. Sophomore summer and ""Camp Dartmouth"" sound cool too. I've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. I've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.

&#x200B;

In terms of the campuses, I, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either Williams or Dartmouth. Architecture and the ""look"" of a school matter to me a lot though. I really like the rural vibes of both the schools. If anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.

&#x200B;

In terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. However, the people at Williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at Dartmouth, which I've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what I've picked up from the vlogs I've watched and things I've heard. Williams concerns me a bit because I have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. However, Dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.

&#x200B;

That brings me to greek life. From what I have heard, Dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. I have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. I don't really think I would enjoy frats and I'm even more concerned since if admitted I will be on lots of financial aid so I don't know if I'll be able to afford to join one if I wanted to down the road. I have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. I'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I know this is really stupid, but the ivy league pReStIGe is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about Williams but most people know about Dartmouth. I am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but I was wondering if the Ivy League branding that comes with Dartmouth really matters in the future?

I would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between Williams and Dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school. Thank you in advance to all who reply!"

When does the application portal for the Summer Science Program typically open? How was your experience with it? 

Thanks guys! Can’t wait to be on campus next fall."

I've been told that it's possible to work as a research assistant in a lab even in my first year, and I can indicate my interest by emailing professors. I've already looked over all the biology professors and their research on the Williams website, but I'm wondering -- which ones will be most likely to take on freshmen? I have research experience from high school: I've worked with with fruit flies, CRISPR, genetics, Western blots, DNA gel electrophoresis, etc. It would be really  helpful if someone could point me in the right direction as to which professors to email about research, or whether or not I should do it at all.

That being said, I am an introvert that likes to talk to people 1on1. In HS, I had my group of OG friends that I had lunch with every day etc., but I didn't feel the need to hang out with them all the time. In fact, I actually liked being able to choose my own clubs and having a bit of independence/privacy.

I realized it's going to be harder to essentially ""disappear into the background"" at Williams. I know this question might come across as naive but if people see me walking to class/having lunch alone, will I be labeled a weirdo?

>Williams College is also unbelievably cliquish. Because the campus is small and geographically isolated you will soon find that living there means that you are quickly identified, sorted out, accepted or isolated, and conveniently locked into place. For those who settle in the area, the rule of thumb is that you are not accepted by the locals until you are a third generation inhabitant.  
>  
>The social pressures for ideological conformity are immense and enforced on the campus by the faculty, administration and your fellow students.For example, in 2017, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) named Williams College as one of the top ten worst schools for free speech.

And from a Williams alumni...

>Unfortunately, I have found this to be absolutely true. As a current student, I don't want to give away too many identifying details… but just Google “Williams College Council"" and see what comes up. Absolute inanity, combined with a perilous lack of common sense. I'm not Christian, nor am I really a conservative, but I saw very clearly just how hurtfully my Christian friends were ostracized even if they weren't conservative, and vice versa. Not to mention that I've become a bit of a pariah myself for speaking my mind… that is to say, arguing radical leftist policies that literally encouraged ethnic cleansing and were often wrapped up in a heavy dose of bigotry, even if the students and faculty involved refused to acknowledge the obvious....  
>  
>But it's also desperately isolating in a way that goes well beyond “rural area.” There is a clear social and political narrative and if you disagree with a single plank, you are quite genuinely ostracized. I know because it happened to me. I disagreed with one single idea out of pure moral practicality, and I was unceremoniously kicked from group chats, shadow-banned from most clubs, and made to lose quite a number of personal friends. This was not an uneducated opinion, either -- I made the statement that I did on a subject that personally affects my family and myself, in which I have an (admittedly young) lifetime of experience, and in which I also happen to be focusing *both* of my academic majors. It is too bad that the Twitter-esque mentality of echo chambers and dogpiling overwhelmed reasoned discussion, to the point where I am now happily enjoying my year abroad on a different continent. Who knew that the Middle East - missiles and all - could be a more sane and reasoned environment than an elite American liberal arts college?

I'm a conservative Christian but I would never attack or belittle someone for their beliefs and know when it is best to keep my mouth shut. I know that everyone has a different experience on campus but really, how often do incidents like this happen nowadays?

\[Edit: When it comes to controversial issues, I am open to discussion as long as long as people are being respectful. I just don't want people shoving down their beliefs down my throat, as I wouldn't do the same to them.\]"

Looking at the post history, it seems like I'm just one of many who have/will be stopping by to spread my own and indulge in your enthusiasm about the school. If anyone is willing to field questions/let me DM them, please let me know.

I've been burying my nose in the course catalog, crawling through the deep depths of the [Williams.edu](https://Williams.edu) website, and scrolling (as it continues to be updates) through Willipedia ever since I first visited in March. But I'd still love and feel I need a more up-to-date, personal student perspective — one that isn't coming from admissions, either.

\- Mainly, for anyone, I'm wondering what your experiences are with trans students on campus — how many there are, how well they are accepted, how supporting the general environment (in academics, athletics, extracurriculars, dorm life) is. If you're trans yourself or have a close friend whose experience you feel might be relevant, please share.

\- I'm also wondering about how to fit my interests into the (32!) classes I could take at Williams. I'm looking at majoring in some combination of English (with some creative writing)/CompLit (Track 2) and Political Science/Political Economy. While that on its own might not be too difficult, I also want to take full advantage of tutorials — would it be too much to try and take one a semester? I'm also interested in WEPO — how would this shift my major/courseload plans? And, a question more generally about majors — how should I balance major/elective coursework? Is it better to load up on major-relevant courses or to let a few slip by in favor of a passing interest in Sociology, per se?

Please comment any info you think might help me work out these questions.

Thank You,

A (Hopeful) Future Eph"

When I took practice tests, my scores weren't very high to submit to the school (definitely not in the 25th percentile) and was delighted to hear that Williams went Test Optional for a few more years. 

But since it's not test blind, test scores are going to be considered for ones who put it in, and I'm torn between trying to prepare for the SAT while doing IB (which is already rigorous) or just taking my chances and focusing on my GPA. I did read somewhere that students who submit their scores had almost double the chance of getting in compared to those who don't have scores... which makes me a little nervous.

My husband and I were drawn to Williamstown because of the geographical location and a host of other opportunities for our family. We’re interested in moving to the location regardless of whether I would ever be able to attend this school or not.

With our son going into school of his own, I’m about to have an opportunity to invest in education myself. For the past several years, I’ve wanted to earn a degree. As a teenager I was accepted to art college which I did attend briefly, but I ended up leaving due to inner city violence. Add in family drama and I ended up moving out of state and not going back. I got married, had our son, and have been working for the past 7 years.

The truth is, a decade ago, I was an average student. I put my energy less into academics and all into developing my art and college portfolio. I never took the SAT because the art path didn’t need it. Now I’m afraid that because I didn’t fully apply myself academically 10 years ago, I may have harmed my chances of going to school now. 

Despite average transcripts, I have some extracurricular achievement. I am an accomplished writer. I finished Nanowrimo twice, writing 50,000 words in a month both times (1,667 words a day.) My art was published when I was 16, and I won multiple art-related awards. I also suffered a debilitating nerve disorder, completely relearned to walk again, and graduated from physical therapy after 8 intensive months. My experience as a mother has taught me the importance of discipline, responsibility, and efficiency that I took for granted a decade ago.

My concerns are, do any of these things matter in my chances of being accepted to Williams? The major I want, Japanese, is uncommon and I can’t find it as an online degree. I have been to Japan and I’m certain this is what I want. I’m willing to work my rear off to cram and take the SAT now. I’m aware of the residency requirement, and it seems Williams does grant exceptions for students that are married/have children.

Does anyone know of non-traditional students attending Williams at all? Was anyone accepted with less-than-exceptional academic record? How about SAT score?

My husband got his associate degree from Penn State University while our son was newborn, so I know we can work together to make this happen. He’s completely on board with this.

I applied to Williams last year under RD and got rejected which was pretty fair to me but this year I have decided to bring some changes to my application. I understand that every application procedure is different and one cannot pin down what will get me in however it will be really helpful to me if I can get some feedback. So here are the changes I will bring:

1. will submit my SAT score
2. will submit my mid-year report
3. have done considerably more MUNs than last year
4. will submit a dance supplementary video
5. have been teaching this kid English for the past 3 weeks (intend to teach till Nov)
6. part of literature club and editorial club (have done some minor things but still pretty close to me)
7. working on a website
8. working on a research paper
9. (common app) Essay: I will bring some slight changes to the essay that I submitted last year
10. will be a certified yoga teacher so I guess that will come into play

&#x200B;

So far these are the changes that I will bring to my application. Will be a real help to me if you could provide your feedback on it.

P.S. I am an international student and my EFC will remain the same as last year which is around$5k and will apply under ED1 for this fall."

Williams bills itself as a ""need blind"" school like many other highly selective US colleges. However, I heard from students at Columbia and Penn (other need blind selective colleges) that they and a lot of their classmates were advised to apply for aid **after** they received their acceptance letter. They claimed that these colleges were, in fact, not need blind in practice. A student who got in Penn ED waited until May to apply for financial aid, and a student at Columbia I know said that a lot of their class applied after their acceptance. All students mentioned were domestic, and I am a domestic applicant.

In fact, Ivy Coach wrote a [blog post about it](https://www.ivycoach.com/the-ivy-coach-blog/college-admissions/2-reasons-need-blind-admissions-farce/) where they called need blind admissions a ""farce,"" claiming that ""colleges are not need blind as they may suggest so freely to applicants and their parents. Now there are a couple schools that are straightforward — they’re open and honest about being need aware. But all of those colleges that claim to be need blind, they too are need aware. They’re just not as honest about it."" as well as ""If a college actually did this, that college would not be able to sustain itself. It would have to dip into its endowment. Tuition is vital to highly selective colleges. It’s why tuition fees are so high. Schools would never make this error. They take need into consideration, even though they say just the opposite.""

Williams students who receive aid, is there really a disadvantage to applying for aid with your application? If so, can a student who gets in Early Decision apply for aid after acceptance? Will this impact the award in every way? 

Stay safe, y'all."

The reason I am asking is because Williams doesn’t have an international relations/global affairs major. However, in every other way besides major offerings, Williams is my dream school (I hope that makes sense). I was thinking the best supplement for international relations is a major in economics and a concentration in global studies.

Most of our communications are grading and sometimes emails. I have two teachers online that I think would be willing to write a letter. One of them really does seem to like me and the other is nice but I’m definitely not sure if she’d consider me one of her favorite students... not one of her least favorites either! She likes me but we don’t talk enough. Williams only allows three teacher reccomenders. Should I choose two old ones that really love me and one more recent teacher that likes me?

Some articles I read indicated it's not a useless major (and that some significant tech companies even go out of their way to hire philosophy majors to work on machine learning, the comp sci subfield I'm most interested in), but I'm not sure it adds much value, employment-wise, beyond the comp sci major.  It would still be fun though.  I've also considered a second major in mathematics.  If choosing is too hard though, is it unusual and/or super difficult for people to triple major at Williams?

My theories:

\- Maybe the essay prompts harder this year (? IDK if they're different but maybe students got started on the ""storytime"" one and then read that storytime has been canceled, something like that)

\- Maybe Zach Wood's book caused negative impressions of the school?

\- Students tend not to apply ED when they're concerned about not getting a decent finaid package. Is there a reason more students would have to worry about that this year? Alternatively, perhaps Williams/the new pres is promoting the school more heavily in these demographics now, with a correlating reduction in promoting Williams among likely-to-apply-ED demographics?"

I am so attracted to specific programs( WEPO, tutorials, etc.) that I am even considering applying ED.

I am, however, a bit worried by the stereotype of Williams students as smart but unambitious athletes who study/drink/party and aim for jobs on wall street. Someone on CollegeConfidential stated that he felt socially isolated at Williams as someone who enjoyed discussing literature in his free time.

Obviously, I'm confident that the above stereotype doesn't apply to most Ephs  and it does seem that most students are really intelligent and driven. However, I am curious if Williams does have a dominate alcohol/athletics/wall street focused culture or if one can find a thriving ""intellectual"" scene?

TL;DR: Could I fit in at Williams as a non-white person who enjoys having intellectual/literary conversations outside of the classroom, doesn't drink, and is idealistic about ""changing the world""(not pre-professional)?

&#x200B;

I was admitted to Williams earlier today and am excited to potentially attend, but I have a few academic concerns.

&#x200B;

I was browsing through ratemyprofessor's website in order to see how well or poorly the professors in STEM fields were regarded. I mainly stumbled upon extremely old ratings of professors that do not teach here anymore. I do plan on doing pre-med and major in Chemistry, so I was wondering what everyone's perceptions on this department (or STEM in general is)?

  
A few more questions:

1. How large are intro science classes? Such as Physics, Bio, Gen Chem, etc.
2. Are STEM majors a minority at Williams?
3. Is there flexibility in choosing professors? The course catalog shows only one person teaching Intro Chem/Bio classes, so I am worried about the class-sizes for intro courses and the inability to switch professors if one happens to be bad or highly irrational.  


Thanks everyone. I will also be visiting Williams for Preview Day (if anyone (STEM major or not) would be willing to talk to me one-on-one - I'd greatly appreciate that)"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything that I've researched about the college is great, I just have a few hang ups:

I'm really interested in the sciences, specifically cs, bioinformatics, bioengineering, etc; Does Williams a big science/pre-eng scene or is  it small?

I'm pretty sure Williams doesn't offer a B.E-- does it offer a B.S or BAS? 

How is the placement for engineering grad school at Williams?

In general, how do you feel about the Williams' small size?

Thanks for your help; I'll be coming for previews, so advice on who to talk with on campus would be great too!

I've seen on this thread that parties are mostly in the dorms - how do you think this compares to other colleges' parties? Are people able to handle the heavy school work and also have a fun college partying experience?

I know several people who are considering transferring because of how toxic the work culture here is and how damaging it is to the mental wellbeing of the students. Somehow this school costs over 70k a year yet the counseling center and office of accessibility are understaffed.

Additionally, the administration has treats us like actual children. Yes, it is great that with COVID they ensured we did not have an outbreak. However, they put unnecessary measures in place that literally no one supports. For example, there was rumors that someone got roofied a few weeks ago and the school decided that we could only swipe in to our own dorms. And this was at all times. Just a major inconvenience that did 0 to help the situation. And now campus security is shutting down parties in dorms when they never did before, killing the already non existent nightlife here.

And this is not even to consider the additional stress if you are not rich, white, cis, and able bodied.

There have also been 3 suicides in the class of 2024 so far and all the college did was send out the same generic emails with absolutely no changes despite this trend."
