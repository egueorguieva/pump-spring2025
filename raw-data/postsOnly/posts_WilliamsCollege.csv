1c0wiln,UT Austin vs Willams College,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/1c0wiln/ut_austin_vs_willams_college/,78,2024-04-10 21:03:04+00:00,Regular-Salt9623,"Hello everyone, I’ve been admitted some colleges, but I’ve narrowed down my choices to UT Austin and Williams. I’m very lucky, but I’m having a hard time choosing where I should go. First I heavily value diversity. I live in a predominantly white area within Texas, and I myself am black. I’ve struggled with racism within school all of my life, and I cannot tolerate this any further, especially in college. Austin is more diverse than my town, but I don’t know much about Williamstown. I also place heavy emphasis on job placement opportunities and pre-professional development. I’ve been admitted to McCombs at UT, and at Williams, I plan on majoring in Political Economy. Williams as a whole is great from what I’ve read online and in the forums, but when I tell people that I’ve been admitted to Williams, i receive blank faces. I have aspirations to attain a  JD-MBA at an T14 after undergraduate school, and I know Williams is excellent for that, but I don’t know much about UT’s placement into top law schools. I know UT isn’t flexible at all in terms of majors, and that is something I heavily dislike. I would also like any current students or alums input on whether or not the academic culture is cutthroat or collaborative. Please talk about other factors that you feel would be appropriate for my decision making, any and all input is very much appreciated.

Edit: Why is this getting so many downvotes, it’s a genuine question? Was there something I said that is inappropriate?

Thank you so much for everyones advice and input on my last post. I was just admitted to UChicago and wanted to know what your thoughts on Williams were in comparison. Things like class difficulty, pre-law opportunities, intellectual engagement, student culture and body etc. From what I can tell differences in prestige are minimal at best so really just trying to get to know the schools writ large. Thank you all so much and I look forward to potentially committing!"

I was recently admitted to Williams class of '28 as an international student. I didn't apply for any financial aid, and my middle-class parents—they have an annual income of around $60,000, but savings in the hundred thousands and family property inherited somewhere in the future—are concerned that the investment of $350,000 is not worth because its unlikely for me to get a well-paying job after Williams as a non-US citizen. I'll have to do a masters, which, if its in law or an MBA, will likely cost $200,000 more.

They're also concerned that its a massive blunder for me to cloister myself in rural Massachusetts, among American elites, when the global centre of power is shifting rapidly from West to East.

Williams does not have global brand, so its unlikely for me to come back to my home country in Asia and get a good job solely based on William's prestige.

My other options are UCL ($188,000), UCSD ($300,000), and Ashoka University ($60,000).

Obviously, if money wasn't an object, I would run to Williams; it's the best fit for a person like me and I see my thriving intellectually and socially over there. However, that's not the only, or even the most important factor for me right now. What do you guys think?"

I know their transfer rate is very competitive but on the off-chance I happen to get in... how is the community? I'm not introverted but I'm extremely awkward and somewhat shy when it comes to approaching people in a social setting.

  
For example, at my current community college, majority of the students are welcoming and easy to befriend, they even approach you first a lot of the times or they're easy to approach. 

So, coming in as a transfer student where it's already going to be a bit harder to befriend people, would you say students at Williams College are open to befriending new people even if they have their groups?

  
Also, how are students and staff when it comes to an LGBTQ+ student? I'm transgender and although I don't make it my personality, I just want to comfortably present myself and be referred to as the gender I identify as (male). Would there be any problems?

I've really liked Williams since the very beginning (one of my very top choices for a variety of reasons, and also my parents love Williams). I want to fully do my research though before I commit anywhere, so I'd appreciate if people here could answer some of my questions! Thanks so much, I'm so so happy 😊

1. What's the 'tutorial based' academics like? What does this mean exactly? How has your experience been with this teaching style? 

2. What's the friendship scene like? Stratified groups? Everyone socializes with each other, and a few really close friends? Parties? (I'm not a big party person but like to try things out and meet people and have fun) Also- I really don't plan on joining a frat/sorority in college. 

I'm pretty extroverted, but mostly in the sense that I like to spend quality time with my friends or really get to know people. 

I'm not a super outdoorsy person either, which does kind of worry me for my fit to Williams. I like walks and stuff but hiking consistently would be too much for me. 

3. Are you liking the social life at Williams? I heard Williamstown is a hit or miss with people. I talked to a girl from UMich who hated Williams's campus/town and loved UMich's campus/city lol. I'm leaning towards liking a small school more, but I'm not completely sure that I want to be super far away from a city. I like going to cafes and restaurants and museums and stuff. 

4. I'm really confused as to whether I want to pursue medicine (psychiatry) or law. Is Williams a good place to explore both and decide on one path in people's personal experiences? And then how are people doing with law/medicine internships, law/med school admissions, research, etc.? 

5. Does Williams have grade inflation or deflation? 

Lastly for now 6. What's the mental health of the student body like? 
I'm currently a dual enrolled high school senior at a local university with a ~60% acceptance rate. Freshmen here have disappointedly told me that this uni was their 'safety school,' even if I didn't ask at all and the uni is very good! (like... okay I don't know why I had to know that or what I can say😭). Anyways, the overall mental health/student satisfaction here is pretty bad (5+ suicides this year of underclassmen) and the school spirit is medium-low I think. I don't think I could deal with this kind of environment somewhere else for 4 years. How does this environment compare with Williams's?"

pros: 

- Lower total COA, also is giving me more $$; **COA: 60k**

- nice weather

- prestigious on west coast

- in a big city, more opportunities (LA)

- maybe not as well known on east coast (nyc, chicago) for banking

cons:

- farther from me (i'm in midwest)

- high COL in LA ...?

williams:

pros:

- i enjoy colder weather more

- slightly higher ranking, basically no difference 

- i like all the programs there such as study abroad at oxford

cons:

- middle of nowhere

- more $$, **total COA is 66k**

p90047,ED Dilemma: Williams College vs. Dartmouth College,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/p90047/ed_dilemma_williams_college_vs_dartmouth_college/,2,2021-08-21 21:47:28+00:00,LethalVenom1,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I'm a rising high school senior that is applying to colleges this fall. I've narrowed down my ED schools to Williams and Dartmouth and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding between the two schools. I would appreciate any insight that students had that would help me decide. For reference, I will most likely want to study Economics and do something with math, whether that be either doing a double major or getting a minor in math. I will also be cross-posting this to both r/WilliamsCollege and r/dartmouth to get as much input as possible from current students or alumni.

&#x200B;

In terms of the quality of education, I have heard good things about both schools, especially in regards to their econ departments as they are very popular at both colleges. I think the math department at Williams is quite a bit stronger than Dartmouth's, though. Moreover, both schools say they're ""undergraduate-focused"" but I think this is more true of Williams where classes are smaller than Dartmouth and fewer students are competing for research positions and stuff like that especially in a major as popular as econ. Some Wiliams students I have talked to said they even chose Williams over HYPSM because of this and said that Williams has the best quality of education in the world. Does Dartmouth compare? Also, Williams has the Oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.

&#x200B;

The Alumni network also matters to me a lot since I am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. I've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. However, Dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from Dartmouth than Williams. While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in. I don't really know which is better, but I would say maybe Dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but I would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each school.

&#x200B;

This is kinda unique to Dartmouth but I don't know whether the D-Plan is on net good or bad. I've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. Sophomore summer and ""Camp Dartmouth"" sound cool too. I've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. I've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.

&#x200B;

In terms of the campuses, I, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either Williams or Dartmouth. Architecture and the ""look"" of a school matter to me a lot though. I really like the rural vibes of both the schools. If anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.

&#x200B;

In terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. However, the people at Williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at Dartmouth, which I've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what I've picked up from the vlogs I've watched and things I've heard. Williams concerns me a bit because I have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. However, Dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.

&#x200B;

That brings me to greek life. From what I have heard, Dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. I have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. I don't really think I would enjoy frats and I'm even more concerned since if admitted I will be on lots of financial aid so I don't know if I'll be able to afford to join one if I wanted to down the road. I have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. I'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I know this is really stupid, but the ivy league pReStIGe is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about Williams but most people know about Dartmouth. I am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but I was wondering if the Ivy League branding that comes with Dartmouth really matters in the future?

I would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between Williams and Dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school. Thank you in advance to all who reply!"

I was down in Austin doing a freelance photography gig for SXSW and I started talking to a guy in the the audience before the show began. Somehow we got to talking about college, and as one does, I asked him where he went to school. Of course, he mentioned that he'd gone to Williams. ""That's my son's dream school!"" I said, thinking nervously about my son's chances of admission. The guy seemed a little surprised that a stranger in Texas would know where Williams is, no less what kind of curriculum it has. We talked for a bit about that, talked about how it's often mistaken for William and Mary, and then the show began. I never got that guy's name.

At the time, this was mid-March, before college decisions had come out. Fast forward two weeks, and lo, my son got in! He'll be attending in the fall.

My mind keeps tracking back to that conversation, not because I particularly want to strike up a long correspondence, but because it seems like an apt coda. I just want that guy to know: it worked out! My son is over the moon, and so are we."

1. do you think the career center is extremely effective at helping students prepare for interviews, write their medical school applications, etc.? like i've heard a lot about the support they give you but is it actually genuinely groundbreaking and extremely helpful?
2. in your opinion, do you think williams grade inflates, deflates, or neither? what are some common classes that are generally seen as ridiculously wayy too difficult? essentially, i kind of want to know how difficult it is to maintain straight As and A+s -- like what is the time commitment, basically? how many hours do you generally spend on homework? obviously this differs across major, level of class selection, and classes themselves (so would also be awesome if you could specify these in your answer!)
3. what does the social scene look like? how often do people party, are these parties enjoyable, etc. is it easy to make friends and are people generally down to like go out or like study sesh together etc.? what do people usually do for fun?
4. i've heard that williams' culture can be overly like white and preppy -- do you think this is true?
5. how competitive is the premed culture? do you think premed stuff gets at all cutthroat?
6. overall, why do you think premeds drop out? how many generally do? do more people drop out because they realize premed is too much work and it's not worth it, or because they realize they want to do something else, or because of really difficult classes or discouragement, or because they failed a premed requirement that they're not good at (like physics or smth)?
7. i've heard it's insanely easy to get research at williams -- very much as simple as talking to a prof after class -- but is there also good support for undergraduate students who want to conduct more high level research on their own with the help of a professor? like have students written their own papers and done their own research, the kind that gets published and wins awards yada yada
8. how well do people do with medical school applications? like how many people per year generally get into super top tier medical programs? do you know anyone who applied to and succeeded with applications to md-phd programs? (the dream fr)
9. how easy has it been for you to form meaningful relationships with professors and like actually talk to them one-on-one about academics, random stuff that doesn't really pertain to class, personal stuff, etc.?
10. are there competitive club applications?
11. random and maybe not so random cons of williams in your opinion? like what tiny things irk you? what big things irk you? especially what is the biggest annoyance of living in the middle of nowhere LOLL
12. pros of williams that you didn't realize would be amazing until you attended?

I know that just because of how small the school is there will definitely be limited options, but I was hoping there would be at least somewhat of a pool (even if it's shallow.) Also, I was curious given the athletic culture how the queer community is generally treated (I come from a sports-focused all boys school so I am used to some mild toxicity.)

1) Is there a decent sized population of mlm and other queer guys?

2) general treatment of gay men specifically?

I'm a high school senior from NY planning on applying ED to either Williams or Swarthmore. Looking to major in history and pursue a PhD and/or JD in the future, but I'm flexible (of course haha).

Was hoping people could shed some light on the differences between the two that I *can't* find on the website. I know all about Swat's honors program and Williams's tutorial program--love both! I like the Williams campus and school spirit more than Swat's, but I feel a more politically left and grad school prep vibe at Swat.

Differences in diversity? Does Williams have a preppy jock vibe? Which is best for someone ambitious but also politically conscious (I am a well-researched and published Marxist). Thanks guys <3"

I applied ED to Williams and I'm super excited that I got in. When I received my financial aid letter, it was higher than both my mom and I expected but we were reassured by others that it could definitely be lowered, so I enrolled. However, we found out that the external scholarship that I have can't be applied at Williams for cost of attendance (big F) and that the financial aid office could do nothing to lower the expected parent contribution. This isn't great. My mom will not pay my tuition (i knew of this) so this means that the cost falls entirely on me. The price will almost double in my 3rd and 4th years because my sister will graduate college. The price is more than double what net price calculators say and I have no savings for college. What should I do in this situation? The current plan is for me to get a job over the summer (not a bad idea) and also do work study throughout the year (not a good idea) to cover the price. I'm honestly freaking out because this sounds like I'm going to have a pretty stressful freshman and that's not what I imagined at all :("

1. As a school as small as Williams, is it even available? If it is, how costly is it? I know that it says health *insurance* is covered under my scholarship, but I'm not sure how extensive that would actually be.
2. I also read on the website somewhere that the student care centre (or whatever it's called idk) is closed during the summer. I would assume that this means that care is both on campus and that it is not available during the summer, so would that effectively mean that care is not provided during the summer or that it is simply used for outside services instead of simply the on-site location.

I’m currently a high school senior and plan to major in pure math with the goal of eventually pursuing a PhD. Since I’ve maxed out my high school math courses, I’m currently taking linear algebra and abstract algebra at a nearby university.

I’m mainly focusing on applying to R1 universities (for Fall 2025) that offer opportunities to take graduate-level courses and explore various advanced math topics.

I’ve heard great things about studying math at Williams College, but I still have a few unresolved questions. If you are (or were) a pure math major at Williams, I’d really appreciate your insights.

Here are a few things I’ve learned from reaching out to faculty (in plain text), but I’d love to hear your experiences (my questions are in bold text):

1. Williams offers 400-level (also known as senior seminar) courses that are similar to graduate classes. These courses change every semester, ensuring that students always have access to upper-level classes. **What was your experience taking 400-level courses as an undergraduate? Were you able to explore different areas of math? Were there enough class offerings?**
2. Williams provides opportunities to conduct original research with faculty, which can lead to publications. **Have you written any papers that were published with a reputable organization (as an undergraduate)?**
3. Research opportunities and thesis work are primarily available through Williams’ summer program (SMALL). **I understand that students from other colleges also participate in SMALL. Does Williams reserve a certain number of spots for its own students? What was your experience with the SMALL program?**

I also would like to mention that I prefer attending classes with other students so that we can exchange ideas. For now, I’m not particularly interested in pursuing independent study to self-learn a math topic.

Lastly, when I toured Williams in February 2024, we passed through a building where math classes were being held (I can’t remember the name). What struck me as odd was that most of the classrooms were empty, and the two classes that were in session had only about six students each. Is this typical?"

1255x78,Questions from an Uninformed West-Coast RD Admit,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/1255x78/questions_from_an_uninformed_westcoast_rd_admit/,18,2023-03-28 23:18:22+00:00,None,"Hi there! I was accepted to Williams College in the RD round 2 weeks ago. I haven't committed yet, as I still have a couple of questions that I was hoping I could get answered. To preface, I'm a political science (and possibly economics double major) major interested in the law and or consulting.

Thank you for all of your help!

&#x200B;

1. Is it true that there's grade deflation at Williams? Even with local or east coast graduate schools or employers knowing that grade deflation is common, would it negatively affect my placement at jobs or schools in other regions (such as the west coast, etc)? Are Williams' opportunities limited to the Boston/ Northeast area?
2. Are there student gyms available to work out? I could find a few student organizations that allow you to borrow equipment, but are there any local or college gyms that I could go to regularly?
3. What are the chances of receiving a single room vs a double, given that I select my preference as ""single"" on the housing form? I've seen a couple of posts about selecting Mission vs. Frosh Quad. Is there one that's better than the other, or one that you would personally recommend (for making friends, etc)?
4. How easy is it to double major OR change majors? I read that 40% of all undergraduate students double major at Williams, but how much flexibility do students *really* have? I got accepted for Political Science but I'm considering adding Economics and pursuing consulting after college.
5. One of the biggest drawbacks for me is that Williams doesn't accept any AP scores or College Credits. I've taken (and will be taking) a total of \~15 AP tests with passing scores, and also another 10 college classes that would satisfy 75% of community college requirements in California. I could skip 1 to 1.5 years of CC requirements, but weighing that against a 4-year Williams education is rough... Has anyone else been in a similar situation before?
6. The feeling and sense of a community are super important to me. How active are the Debating Team or the South Asian Students' Association? I come from an Asian-dominated county, city, and school. I'm open to all demographics and realize that Williams contains an entirely different cultural dynamic. How active are associations like SASA, and how big does their membership tend to be? Are they smaller close-knit groups, or are they wider groups with their own friend groups and cliques?
7. One of the biggest pros about Williams is its huge alumni network and successes in job/ graduate school placements. Can anyone describe their experiences with the '68 Center for Career Exploration? What does the process look like? Does it involve emailing former students at Williams? Is this the same as the EphLink mentoring website? Also, since a large percentage of Williams alumni take jobs in Boston, are there alumni that help connect you with opportunities in the west coast or southeastern United States? (similar to #1)"

I'm applying for the class of 2026. Williams is one of my top schools and I'm eager to go given the opportunity. I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me their opinion on my chances of being accepted?

I go to a really competitive school in NJ. I have about a \~95 GPA and I got 1530 on my SAT.

I also believe that I have pretty good ECs. I am in NHS and have the Seal of Biliteracy for Spanish. I am the founder of a charitable club and I also have over 100 hours of service. I'm also involved in certain other EC's and am the head editor of my school's digital publication.

Williams College has become my dream school over the past few months and I was thinking of applying with ED. 

I'm an international IB student who didn't think of preparing for an American Uni until now, which means that I haven't thought of preparing for the SAT until now (I'm in Grade 11). When I took practice tests, my scores weren't very high to submit to the school (definitely not in the 25th percentile) and was delighted to hear that Williams went Test Optional for a few more years. 

But since it's not test blind, test scores are going to be considered for ones who put it in, and I'm torn between trying to prepare for the SAT while doing IB (which is already rigorous) or just taking my chances and focusing on my GPA. I did read somewhere that students who submit their scores had almost double the chance of getting in compared to those who don't have scores... which makes me a little nervous.

3. have done considerably more MUNs than last year
4. will submit a dance supplementary video
5. have been teaching this kid English for the past 3 weeks (intend to teach till Nov)

7. working on a website
8. working on a research paper
9. (common app) Essay: I will bring some slight changes to the essay that I submitted last year
10. will be a certified yoga teacher so I guess that will come into play

I was admitted into Williams for the upcoming fall semester and now that I'm actively considering it (and leaning towards attending), I'm kind of stressing myself out over a slip in grades I had last semester. To cut to the chase, I went from straight As every other semester of school to this last year with 3 As, 3 Bs, and 1 C; my final GPA for that semester was a 4.3. My schedule was as tough as I could get it and I struggled a bit with that; my As were in AP Psych + Calc BC and dual enrollment civics, my Bs in AP Macro/Micro/Bio, and my C in AP Phys C E&M. I don't think those are unreasonably bad grades for those classes and especially given my circumstances (I do these classes virtually through my school because we don't offer them in person) but I am worried about the possibility of my acceptance being revoked because of the grade slip. I know it wasn't that big of a drop---from everything I've read, it sounds like I'll be alright because it wasn't in the grand scheme of things *that* drastic, but I'm still concerned. I never got a mid-year grades report submitted so that wasn't considered when I was admitted (my counselor sent them that today through Common App, and I've emailed admissions regarding the situation, still waiting to hear back from them on that). This semester's grades will be better, likely straight A's with maybe a B/C in physics.

Should I be worried? We're planning on visiting Williams this weekend and I don't want to make the 10 hour drive there only for it not to be an option. I know nobody here can likely answer this concretely but any perspectives on it would be nice while I wait for my answer to come in the email.

And, does anyone have any recommendations for things to do/see on campus or in Williamstown during a visit? :) Not entirely sure what else I can do other than walk the campus and try to get a feel for it all. Like I said, I live 10 hours away from Williams (in West Virginia) and so I want to make my trip count, both so as to have made it worthwhile and to soothe my anxiety about attending school somewhere so far from home.

Any advice would be appreciated greatly, sorry for the wall of text lol"

(TL;DR: Edexcel student here, have always been above average as a student and got all 9s in IGCSEs, but flunked my AS-level exams and ended up getting BCC, although, I believe that my true strengths bloom freely with my ECAs. Should I apply ED to Williams, my dream college, or just go for a safer option?)

I am from a LDC in South Asia, and I have received an Edexcel education ever since middle school. All throughout high school, I have been a decent student, ranking in the top single-digit percentage always. The hard work paid off as I got all 9s on my IGCSEs (otherwise, I got a 4.0 GPA in all of my courses for my sophomore year). However, owing to following an improper mode of hybrid education towards to end of 2021 and the first quarter of this year, my AS-level education was severely hit and I ended up getting BCC on my 3 subjects. In retrospect, it isn't the end of the world, as I am retaking a few papers and hoping to bounce back, but the sadness (and I only say this because I haven't been mentally evaluated to be clinically depressed) I suffered through this year has harshly impacted by mental health and wellbeing - which in turn affected my SAT score too.

I retook the SAT on Oct 1, and am expecting a 1450+ hopefully. However, my strengths get fully expressed through my ECAs. I am a Duke of Edinburgh Alum, having completed all the journeys and having received all three certifications. I was also in charge of handling the marketing for 2 F&B giants in my country, and during my tenure, we reached 10s of millions of people across the internet. Being an adept growth hacker, I co-founded (and am serving as the chief editor) a news platform which quickly became the biggest bite-sized media agency in my country, and which reached people in the metric of 100s of millions across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn. The success of our bite-sized media agency saw one of our competitors partnering up with us to come under an umbrella company - one that I am a majority stakeholder of, and that has recently been valued at $1.0 million in our seed round (however, we are aiming for a $1.5 million valuation currently). Besides, I have been part of my school's football club and MUN club since middle school, having won trophies and medals for my football team, and serving as the director general at my school's MUN conference. Moreover, I have also appeared on a soap opera on our national TV network, and have acted in multiple OVCs, apart from voicing several commercials and characters over the year. I have also served as an English tutor to a few juniors, over the years.

Williams College has almost been like an exotic dream for me ever since I was in the 8th grade, and learned that my cousins graduated from Bates, Wellesley, and Pomona, while one was soon going to start at W&L. I want to study Economics and Williams have always seemed to match all of my needs and wants from the institution I want as my alma mater. However, my current academic year has seriously strained me mentally and demotivated me drastically. Should I still apply for Early Decision to Williams, or is it too ambitious? Should I instead go for a safer school?"

I was put on the transfer waitlist back in April. According to the email they sent out, they'll be revisiting the waitlist as of today. Does anyone who got off the transfer waitlist mind sharing when they heard back? Just trying to get an idea of how long it might take to hear back.

I've done mock trial in high school and would love to continue doing similar club activities if I can... but it seems the only thing mock trial-ish at williams stopped functioning in 2019 or so. Or at least that's what I got from searching the internet. Any current students who know of it please let me know 😔"
mi3re5,Going into foreign policy after Williams?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/mi3re5/going_into_foreign_policy_after_williams/,8,2021-04-01 20:05:16+00:00,vaeporwave,"Hello,

I was wondering if it is easy for Williams undergrads to go into foreign policy (e.g. working in global affairs for the Government, working at a Think Tank, etc.) after they graduate. Are there students at Williams who have these aspirations, and how successful are they with their goals?

The reason I am asking is because Williams doesn’t have an international relations/global affairs major. However, in every other way besides major offerings, Williams is my dream school (I hope that makes sense). I was thinking the best supplement for international relations is a major in economics and a concentration in global studies. However, I want to know if I would have a solid shot at going into the foreign policy world with a degree from Williams or should I look elsewhere?

Thank you so much for your help."

I am a HS senior applying to Williams this year. I am wondering how many of you submitted your academic paper instead of the Williams' supplement essays. (or if you have any friends who did it!) All the college essay blogs say it's just a bad idea to submit the academic paper, but I am not sure. 

The Williams admission website says it's ""entirely"" optional to turn in the supplemental essays, but I actually doubt that. But, unlike Amherst, Williams lacks explanations for option 4, which is submitting an academic paper...? Also. ""in the last year"" means within the past 12 months, right? 

I got a good grade from that essay and my teacher wrote down really good comments as well... so I am not sure if this choice is really against my chance!

Thank you!!!"

1) I'm worried about the small size of the school - I attend a high school (<100 per grade), and feel incredibly stifled by the size. I understand that, obviously 100 -> 500 is a big jump, so it totally may not apply, but if anyone who is a current student can speak to that please let me know! Especially given the rural location

2) I'm lowkey worried that everyone is so locked in to studying that the social scene is not very good - I'm not a big partier, but also would like to have some fun/not spend my weekends studying the whole time - do I need to worry about this?

3) From what I've read, the perception of Williams is kind of a jock-y culture. While I'm not very into sports, I am fairly outdoorsy - I guess I'm just wondering if not being into sports would be a detriment to my experience?

4) As someone who is fairly awkward, is it difficult to make friends at Williams? Obviously it'll depend from individual to individual, but is there a lot of cliqueyness or weirdness?

  
Thanks so much :)"

2. Are there tech based career fairs? 

3. What tech/latinx clubs are there?

4. Are there any Latinx in CS at Williams College? 

5. What are some things I should do in preparation when majoring in CS at Williams? 

6. Is there a platform that students at Williams college use to view rankings of current professors based on what previous students thought about their teaching? (Similar to rate my professor)

7. Do the CS students at Williams college help each other or purposely give each other bad advice to be at a more competitive edge? 

8. Do William’s College CS Alumni actually help current students in terms of referrals, internships, full-time jobs, and connections? (I have seen and heard that many students and alumni are consistently being hired from big tech firms. Although, I personally might not work at a big tech firm it does give me some reassurance)
