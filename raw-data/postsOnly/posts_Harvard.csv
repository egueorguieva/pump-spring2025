Furthermore, I do not trust that my brother will be responsible once he is allowed to practice. He’s used to be—no, he IS a conman! And I can handle a conman, but him with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun! I decided to make him aware of these opinions on Thursday, at our family Thanksgiving dinner. He then started to scream at me like a child, saying that I “never cared about him!” I spoke a few hurtful words in retaliation. I’m not wrong though, I could never make a mistake like this! He’s getting his degree from Cornell for Christ’s sake, what a joke! He defecated through a sunroof when he was an undergraduate and I saved him! I shouldn’t have. I helped him get a job in the mailroom at my own firm! What was I thinking? He’s turned our entire family against me, convincing them that I’m too prideful! He’s been stealing money off our parents since he was nine, convincing them that he’s just their precious little boy! And he’s going to become a lawyer? What a sick joke! I need advice on how to stop him from getting his degree. I should’ve done it a long time ago, but I didn’t, and you have to help me do it now!"

1erlwhh,NOTE to Incoming Freshman: DON'T study Computer Science,579,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1erlwhh/note_to_incoming_freshman_dont_study_computer/,177,2024-08-13 23:09:54+00:00,Grand_bc_8985,"I'm a rising senior studying CS and Statistics, and I, to a degree, regret studying computer science. Now, contrary to the title of this post, I am not saying that no one should study computer science. Rather, the title is hyperbolizing but emphasizing the fact that you should approach the prospect of studying computer science with some hesitation, especially at Harvard. Studying computer science is not that much of a straightforward choice anymore. However, despite the exaggerated title, I honestly suggest that no one studies *only* computer science, without pairing it with a joint or double concentration in an adjacent field (e.g statistics, mathematics, physics and applied math). This is simply my opinion, which I think is an unpopular one, but I am just giving my perspective.

Reasons for not studying computer science:

1. *Oversaturated Job Market*: The job market is oversaturated, as there have been an influx of computer science degrees over recent years. It used to be that studying computer science at many universities would guarantee a solid job and studying computer science at Harvard would almost guarantee some kind of well-paying, entry-level big tech job. This is not the case anymore, just getting a computer science degree at Harvard isn't enough anymore. On top of taking and studying CS classes, companies are expected students to do personal projects/research or past internships, regardless of what school you go to, for internships and entry-level positions. In addition to that, passing interviews requires a rigorous study and practice of Leetcode-type problems.

The point is that studying computer science is losing relevance in terms of getting a tech job because employers are recognizing more the fact that computer science is not the same as software engineering. In my opinion, employers aren't necessarily prioritizing computer science students that much anymore for SWE/tech jobs over other STEM students (math, physics, and engineering) students. What you learn in most of your CS courses, which tend to be more theoretical, don't matter that much for doing the job. You literally need a basic understanding of coding (i.e. syntax, loops, functions, conditionals) and then some foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms (which you can get from leetcode). Leetcode-style problems aren't even typically relevant when you get to the job, but having a notion of efficiency is important. Even algorithms classes like CS120 and CS124 don't help immensely with leetcode. CS124 can help make **starting** leetcode easier, but you won't be able to solve leetcode problems well just after taking that class. You still need to practice.

Even if computer science classes like CS124 were tremendously helpful, the point is that many students take these kinds of classes, not just computer science students. CS124 is a very popular course among math, physics, and applied majors as well. In fact, the students who usually perform the best in these classes are people with more mature mathematical backgrounds. Employers don't really care if you've taken a breath of computer science courses; they're just looking for basic competencies in programming and interview material. A math major who's has a background in algorithms is essentially equivalent to a CS major who's taken an algo course + a bunch of other CS courses when it comes to competing for tech jobs, especially if both have the adequate amount of outside-the-classroom experiences. Heck, sometimes studying STEM doesn't even matter. There's a decent number of humanities concentrators who end up working as software engineers after graduation.

2. *Intellectual Return and Pedagogy.* I would argue that studying computer science over other STEM fields doesn't provide much of an intellectual and even knowledge benefit. As I mentioned, a lot of the concepts you learn in computer science courses aren't directly relevant to jobs in the industry. The fact is, you are probably going to forget most of the stuff you learned in your computer science classes a few months after you graduate. Heck, it's likely you can barely remember material from courses a month after the semester ends. The most important concepts you learn from college is how to *problem-solve* and how to *learn*.

While I would say that studying computer science does improve problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning skills, other STEM fields seem to be more effective at doing this for pedagogical and natural reasons. Specifically at Harvard, and also at other universities, computer science courses are generally not as well taught as other types of STEM classes. This pedagogical gap happens because material tends to be glossed over in computer science classes, while math and statistics classes focus more on subtleties and foundational concepts. This also seems to be because the computer science department is very research-oriented while other departments, especially statistics, tend to focus more on teaching. Most computer science professors treat teaching as presenting basic concepts needed to understand their research while other professors pay more careful attention to how they introduce a concept to their students.

An important idea is that computer science is literally a **branch of mathematics.** Therefore, many computer science concepts rely on using math skills. If you have a solid math background, which you can develop by studying subjects like math, physics, and engineering, transitioning to computer science is not really that difficult. Someone who studied computer science for years may start out with more knowledge than you, but they might not necessarily be better at solving computer science problems. Domain-specific knowledge isn't critical for solving many problems in computer science, because the knowledge can be picked up relatively quickly if you're comfortable with mathematics. This does not mean that people who study computer science don't also have the skills to comfortably transition to math and engineering, but it is easier to go from math/engineering/physics to computer science than vice versa. Even if you're interested in going into academia for CS, I don't think you get that much advantage from studying it over students studying adjacent-fields.

TLDR: Don't only study computer science. At the minimum, pair it with something else. Opinions are my own, and you're happy to disagree."

1g0gvaa,Has the Harvard Crimson ever retracted/apologized for supporting the Khmer Rouge ,302,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1g0gvaa/has_the_harvard_crimson_ever_retractedapologized/,67,2024-10-10 11:45:02+00:00,Ouroboros963,"This is a very specific question, and it obviously happened a long time ago, so I don't know if anybody will have an answer for me. 

I have been reading the Harvard Crimsons old coverage of Cambodia, where the crimson openly supports the Khmer Rouge. Now prior to the fall of Nol's Military dictatorship and Americas bombing campaign, supporting the Khmer Rouge is understandable. However, after the Khmer Rouge takes power and begins Yero Zero in 75, the Crimson while still supporting them out a kind of ""socialist solidarity "", the news of atrocities begins to cause some trepidation. (Cambodia and Crimson Politics - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/9/1/cambodia-and-crimson-politics-pbobne-day/) 

However by 76, as what is probably the worst genocide since the Holocaust is in full swing, the crimson has not only continued its support for the Khmer Rouge but has moved to open genocide denial. (Red Scare Over Cambodia - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/2/28/red-scare-over-cambodia-pbpbress-poison/). 

Thus my question is, has the Crimson ever retracted/apologized for their support for a regime that it is not hyperbolic to say is comparable to Nazis in their crimes against humanity, and is there anywhere I can read it. "

They have perfect grades (some in pretty hard concentations), have ethereal extracurricular contributions while also having a great social life. Looking at Rhodes and Marshall scholars, for example, really makes me wonder how some people manage to accomplish so many things.

For me, personally, I think I've always worked hard throughout college, so I don't really regret anything in terms of my work ethic. I study a challenging concentration (e.g a combo CS, Math, Stat, Physics), have a solid GPA, and landed a solid internship this summer. I do realize there are times when I could have done things more optimally and taken advantage of more opportunities, but some people really make me wonder if there is so much more I can do.

There are some students here, particularly the people who win prestigious fellowships and awards (Hoops, Summa, Phi Beta Kappa, etc.) who really make doing college look ridiculously easy. Like, I seriously wonder if these people are ever challenged at all during their college life.

My question is how do these people achieve these things? I know they work hard and have excellent time-management skills, but it can't just be as simple as that. I'm trying to see what they do to see how I can improve, though I guess there's not much I can do in college since I'm going into my senior year. Though, these tips would be helpful to anyone in any facet of life. How are some people so ""cracked""?"

I'm a first year PhD and I've been really sad lately at how little there is to get involved in as a graduate student. Most of the resources and opportunities that make Harvard a special place are reserved for undergraduates.

Most of the best clubs and orgs are only for undergraduates. Crimson, the entirety of theatre, lampoon, etc..

The amazing residential life system is only for undergrads. The parties in finals clubs are only for undergrads. What are grad students even supposed to do outside of research? Join the badminton club?? 

In my undergrad I did a lot of writing and theatre as an outlet and now I'm basically banned from doing either in any of the most active organizations.

Going to a bar and drinking with friends is sooo boring.. I wanna actually do shit. The mountaineering club has been really nice and let me join. Idk it's just hard to make friends outside your lab group and no one really cares. There are no school wide events for graduate students. No culture of going to the Harvard-Yale game. 

Some people tell me that this is what graduate school is like everywhere. That most of the institutions are primarily focused on making the undergraduate life as best as it can be. Graduate school is like a job they say, you're supposed to just sit around in lab all day. I didn't know this.. I thought I go to a research institution. To a school where they'd care about making sure we had lives outside of research and had outlets to keep our mental health straight.

Honestly I'm really disillusioned by Harvard and I'm close to dropping out. I'm in CS and turned down a job that pays six figures to join Harvard. I feel horrible. If anyone could tell me I'm wrong and help me find ways to pursue my passions (theatre, writing, lampoon, crimson, etc.) or find opportunities for things outside of lab that would be amazing.

I guess my advice to incoming freshman: Get involved with research as soon as you get to campus, especially if you have any thought of going to grad school in the future. Research is also a way to show initiative and independence to employers. 

Now, since I’ve messed up and only have one year, I’m trying to make the best out of my current situation. I’m writing a thesis and am truly trying to do my best on that. What else do you suggest I do during my senior year to build some undergrad research profile before I graduate?"

""Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

Over the last 12 days, the encampment in Harvard Yard has disrupted our educational activities and operations. The right to free speech, including protest and dissent, is vital to the work of the research university. But it is not unlimited. It must be exercised in a time, place, and manner that respects the right of our community members to do their work, pursue their education, and enjoy the opportunities that a residential campus has to offer. The encampment favors the voices of a few over the rights of many who have experienced disruption in how they learn and work at a critical time of the semester. I call on those participating in the encampment to end the occupation of Harvard Yard.

The disruptions from this encampment at the heart of the University have been numerous. Harvard College exams and other important activities and events have had to move elsewhere. Safety concerns over the past two weeks, including those raised as a result of students sleeping outdoors overnight, have required us to sharply limit access to Harvard Yard. Although some community members have said they are undisturbed by these conditions, we continue to hear reports of students whose ability to sleep, study, and move freely about the campus has been disrupted by the actions of the protesters. We are especially troubled by increasing reports that some within, and some supporting, the encampment have intimidated and harassed other members of our community. When Harvard staff have requested to see IDs in order to enforce our policies, supporters of the encampment have at times yelled at them, tried to encircle them, and otherwise interfered with their work. We have also received reports that passers-by have been confronted, surveilled, and followed. Such actions are indefensible and unacceptable.

As first-year students move out and as we begin our extensive preparations for Commencement, this ongoing violation of our policies becomes more consequential. Thousands of family members, friends, and loved ones will soon join us to celebrate the achievements of graduate and undergraduate students who have earned the right to walk in Commencement. This celebration is the culmination of years of hard work and accomplishment. The members of the Class of 2024 deserve to enjoy this milestone uninterrupted and unimpeded. It would be especially painful if students who graduated from high school or college during the pandemic were denied a full graduation ceremony for a second time.

The individuals participating in the activities of the encampment have been informed repeatedly that violations of University and School policies will be subject to disciplinary consequences and that further violations and continued escalation will result in increasingly severe sanctions. Last week, faculties across the University began delivering disciplinary notices to students who continued to participate in unauthorized, disruptive activity in the Yard despite these notices.

I write today with this simple message: The continuation of the encampment presents a significant risk to the educational environment of the University. Those who participate in or perpetuate its continuation will be referred for involuntary leave from their Schools. Among other implications, students placed on involuntary leave may not be able to sit for exams, may not continue to reside in Harvard housing, and must cease to be present on campus until reinstated.

Enforcement of these policies, which are essential to our educational mission, is an obligation we owe to our students and the Harvard community more broadly. It is not, as some have suggested, a rejection of discussion and debate about the urgent issues that concern the University, the nation, and the world. As an academic institution, we do not shy away from hard and important questions. There are many ways for our community to engage constructively in reasoned discussion of complex issues, but initiating these difficult and crucial conversations does not require, or justify, interfering with the educational environment and Harvard’s academic mission. Our disagreements are most effectively addressed through candid, constructive dialogue, building not on disruption, but on facts and reason.

Sincerely,
Alan M. Garber """

t7pf9d,Wondering what I did wrong and why no one wants to be my friend.,100,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/t7pf9d/wondering_what_i_did_wrong_and_why_no_one_wants/,15,2022-03-06 02:57:09+00:00,euroinle,"I’m a pretty social, outgoing person. I get along easily with people and I really wanted to have a large group of friends who I can just socialize with and hang out with. I did recruitment for several RSOs, and I was so excited thinking now I could have a bunch of people to spend time with, go out with, be friends with.

I was so happy thinking about having a “family” on campus. I have plenty of friends at Harvard, but I really wanted a solid friend group who I could hang out with all the time, go out to eat with, and get super close to. Not just sporadically see or study with.

I got rejected from every single RSO I did recruitment for. I don’t know why. I thought we had great conversations, I thought I vibed with the people. I thought I was going to have friends. This hurts so much worse because it’s not a rejection based on academics or skills. The criteria for joining an RSO is that you’re the type of person they want to be friends with.
It’s a rejection of me as a person. The members for multiple organizations each got together, multiple times, and sat down and agreed I’m not someone they’d ever want to spend time with or be around. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me that none of them at all would have me as a friend. Wondering what I did wrong. Was I not fun enough, not social enough, not friendly enough? I thought our conversations were great. 

I feel like now I’ve missed my chance. I’ll never have a “family” like that now. I could try again next year. But I won’t be a first-year anymore, and why would people who don’t like me now like me then. I don’t know what I should’ve done differently.

I’m so sad.

Edit: I’m reading the nice comments. Thanks, you guys. It’s helping me feel better."

(I am Joe Blitzstein, a professor in the Statistics Department. I teach Stat 110 and co-direct the Stat concentration.) Of course I'm the most knowledgeable about Stat courses but I also have many years of experience with academic advising more generally, as well as many years of hearing students tell me about their experiences in various math, applied math, CS, and other courses. 

I'm announcing this session only on Reddit. It will be next Tuesday 8/16 on Zoom (not on Reddit), starting at 8 pm ET, and running at least until 9 pm (maybe later depending on how many people show up). I haven't tried this before, and may end up alone in a Zoom room, but I get the sense that there are many questions from students, especially with the sad demise of shopping period. 

If you're a Harvard College student, I would love to see you there! I don't want to post the Zoom link publicly, so email me at [blitz@g.harvard.edu](mailto:blitz@g.harvard.edu) at least an hour in advance and I'll send you the link. If you're a Harvard grad student, feel free to email me also and we can figure out if it makes sense for you to attend this session or (if there is enough demand) one for grad students. 

Feel free also to drop by to say hi even if you don't have specific questions at the moment!"

I think that I tried my best during the semester, and then failed the finals, came back home to reflect, and ultimately realized I didn't do enough. It was my fault for not putting in more work, attending more office hours, consistently reading through lecture notes, asking more questions, etc. I just don't know what to do anymore at this institution.

More context: Of course, the consensus of rational Mexicans is that these words are absolute nonsense, however, in this period, unfortunately, many irrational people are sharing this kind of speech by the president.

These speeches are a way of indoctrinating the exaltation of patriotism/nationalism, where the rhetoric is that foreigners are ""evil by nature"" and thay ""they prevent us from developing because they only want to take advantage of us"", in addition to demeaning the education, in a country like Mexico where half of its population only completes the first half of secondary education, this kind of speech in general mobilizes the masses who are looking for an imaginary enemy, generates feelings on ignorant people and unfortunately increases the popularity of the president. 

As a Mexican, I would like to hear your comments, this video has been around for a long time, it was on the news in our country and yet I never heard an official response from Harvard or its community, I would really like to see what you think without holding back. Thank you."

They've been invreasing tuition during the pandemic even though the classes were remote, and now they're increasing them again? Why?

Edit 2: I have been asked what specific tuition increase I'm referring to, here it is. In May 2021 I paid $1880 for a 4 credit HSS class. This year, that same class costs $3,500 ($2,120 if you are accepted into an ALB program). This means, The HSS tuition has increased 86% for non-enrolled students and 12% for enrolled students. A CNBC [study](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/college-tuition-is-now-rising-at-a-rate-lower-than-inflation.html) from October 2021 notes on average tuition and fees in US universities increased by 1.3%, making the Harvard increase excessive. Another [note](https://finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation/) from [Finaid.org](https://Finaid.org) shows that tuition rates generally increase about 8% a year, which again makes the HSS increase excessive.

Edit: I have no idea why every single one of my responses are being downvoted. Listen, at HES, we're not the kids of hedge-fund managers, and some of us want to get a degree. But increasing tuition by 75% means we have to start over at another institution because it is no longer affordable. If you are of a socio-economic status that allows you to absorb that massive increase in cost, good for you. But don't try to silence poor or minority students who can't."

I really did think I gave lpsa my all. I tried the best I could and if I continue doing at a similar level, my premed gpa likely will stay this way and if not lower. For me, it’s fine, but what realistically should I be aiming for as a premed? My friends at state schools are getting perfect gpa, but their classes sound so much easier and they keep saying they barely do any work.

The author, who was a writer for the Crimson, maturely entitled their piece: ""From a Suspended Senior: With a Raised Middle Finger and Love in My Heart"" claimed the following:

>I grew up trans in rural Maine, **working in kitchens and painting houses**. I’ve come face to face with the law, **moved away from home** at 16. Where I’m from, going to college is not a given and leaving the state is uncommon.

>But in the spring of 2020, **living out of a garage loft without running water**, I became one of the first openly trans valedictorians in the country and the first person from my high school to get into Harvard.

What they left out is the widespread news coverage that appears to make clear that this is a warped version of the truth.  For example:

[https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian](https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian)

>The very first decision he made was to move out of his family’s house **and into their garage**, where he could live more independently. Since then, he has worked a number of minimum-wage jobs to support himself, buying his own food, clothes and other necessities. **His parents didn’t ask him to move out** **or pay his own way**, but it was something that the teen needed to do for himself.  
. . . 

>The teen’s fierce independence is part of his personality, according to his dad, **Belfast Mayor** Eric Sanders.

Having this context helps the Crimson's readers (and reddit users) obtain a greater understanding of the mentality and veracity of the suspended students that are claiming that they are victims of ""Harvard's injustice""."

I was in the Science Center on Wednesday, and I was having a pretty difficult day dealing with an upsetting situation. I was crying, a lot, sitting on one of the chairs/benches in the Science Center near the side exit toward the Kennedy School. I was on the phone with a friend, venting, and still crying. It was pretty clear that I was very upset and going through something difficult. 

Someone - a young guy who I assume was an undergrad - was walking by, saw me crying, came up to me and gave me a kind look trying to show empathy. He might have been wearing something blue, though it's hard to remember now. He might have mouthed something to try to console me without interfering with my call, or briefly asked me if I was OK. Then he stretched out his hand to me so that I could put my hand in his. I did. After that, I might have said to him that I'm OK, and maybe (hopefully) said thanks. 

To that guy: thank you for showing me compassion and empathy. Thank you for caring. Thank you for offering your hand to me. Your intuition was correct - I really needed human contact and support in that moment. I needed someone's hand. You were right to approach me and try to make sure that I was OK. What you did for me was not a small thing. It mattered a lot.

The distressing situation that had made me so upset will be resolved. I'll be fine. But thank you for helping me in that moment. More people at Harvard should be like you - but you more than make up for the ones who aren't.

I'm a current sophomore here and to sum everything up, I am absolutely miserable at this school. When I first got into Harvard, I was so blinded by prestige that I just committed on a whim despite being fortunate enough to have many other good options to choose from. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day.

I'm not doing great academically; I came in pre-law but that has changed several times and I don't even know what I want to do anymore. I have other issues, but the worst part of it all is that I have literally no friends and feel like I don't belong anywhere here. Believe me, I have tried SO hard; up until this point, I would spend so many hours every week finding people to get meals with, joining tons of clubs, doing IM sports, quite literally everything people suggest doing to meet new people. But I never end up with any lasting friends no matter how hard I try to keep in touch, and many people have simply just flaked on me or abandoned me when we actually do make plans. I had really hoped it would get better sophomore year, but so far it's only been getting worse. I have nobody to talk to, nobody to hang out with, and every single day feels like the same thing on loop. Every night I just sit alone in my dorm either crying or feeling numb. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past, but with things being so bad this year especially, it's worse than ever and I frequently find myself seriously thinking about ending things because what difference would it even make?

I have had great friends in high school and other places; it just feels like Harvard is the one place I don't click with anyone no matter how much I put myself out there, and the overall fake and toxic culture here doesn't help. I came to college hoping and even expecting that I would make at least a few great friends and have a fun college experience, but it's only making me so, so depressed and alone. I just want to be able to go out with friends once in a while, have someone to eat meals in the dining hall with. Is that really too much to ask?

I'm really on the fence about just sticking it out for 2 more years or seriously considering transferring somewhere else. I feel like the logical decision from a career/future perspective would be to just stick it out because firstly, I don't think it will look great on my resume/job applications, especially transferring from a school as renowned as Harvard. Also, if I transfer as a junior, I anticipate that it will be very difficult to integrate with the new school and make friends at this point. I'm so miserable at Harvard, but I'm worried to let go in case my efforts to transfer won't end up being worth it.

Could I please get some advice? I'm so desperate and sad and I really need some honest thoughts from people. Thanks."

p4bzma,A summary of the discord drama and how it relates to the subreddit,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p4bzma/a_summary_of_the_discord_drama_and_how_it_relates/,19,2021-08-14 17:12:43+00:00,toadbro,"Recently, the discord that is associated with this subreddit has gone through some major changes. In short, the members of the discord have completely migrated over to a new discord with the previous mods as the owners.

Why did the members decide to change discords? As another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p3c2y9/wrong_discord_on_subreddit_sidebar/) mentions, this was due to issues with the ownership. The specific issues were summarized in that thread, but the thread was locked before other members could elaborate on the details. The owner was never present, took credit for the work the two main admins did, and refused to transfer ownership even after a vote among the moderators on discord. This server was massive, highly active, and a crucial social hub especially during the pandemic, but almost nobody knew who the owner was. In fact, the owner had as little as 13 messages in the server over several years. This all got intense over the last couple of months as the owner ghosted all of the members, including the admins.

Now, this all just seems like isolated discord drama. This directly relates to the subreddit as the owner and one other admin are the major moderators of this subreddit. Even though the new [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/harvard) is the only active one of the two, the owner of the other discord server changed the link on the subreddit to redirect to their server rather than the active one.

All of these problems are a result of the moderation teams on both the previous discord and the current subreddit. The top moderators are not Harvard affiliated anymore and have been the main power holders for an extended period of time. We would not be opposed to the idea of alumni as moderators, but these particular moderators have shown no interest in being a part of the communities they are moderating and should pass off their roles to active members of the communities.

Perhaps instead of locking threads with questions and ghosting us more, you can take some time and answer them directly. Also, there is still a link to the discord on the subreddit. You should probably remove that if you are totally trying to disconnect from the discords."

From the very start, I recall feeling unmotivated and struggling with even the easy stuff. I tried constantly, but never succeeded, in figuring out what is going on mental health wise. I really tried.

Without getting too specific, I regret how I spent my time at Harvard. I got into a particular club and thought it was a golden ticket to a particular path. It was a very Quixote-like because it was…not what I expected, and actually so, so much worse. It chewed me up and spit me out. I kept spending my time there thinking things would get better, but it was sunk cost fallacy thinking. I wish every day I put time into other activities.

I am consumed by regret and self-blame. I wake up in a panic over it. When I think of the “good times,” or the covid era when things were relatively calm and easy, before I joined the club, I feel legitimate fear. Does anyone have fear around nostalgia? I’ll remember something somewhat pleasant and feel absolute dread.  Like, why couldn’t I lock in at that moment? Why didn’t I do differently? Why didn’t I keep talking to that person I used to talk to? The gist of the thoughts is generally, “I was so safe then.” Maybe it’s because the rut I’m in has been causing some serious tension at home. It feels really scary.

Are there any alumni hanging around here who had a rough time at Harvard, and even the first few years out of school, but got back on their feet? I could really use some hope right now. My thoughts have been getting pretty dark."

My biggest remaining question mark, though, are the people. What are people actually… like? I’ve run into two competing explanations and I don’t think either is fully or always true: everyone is either an obsessive networker or it’s just full of amazing magical super smart people.

I got great grades and a high SAT and had good ECs that I would say are typical of a t20 student but doesn’t necessarily scream “HARVARD”, but still, I wasn’t an absolute sweat in high school like some of you folks, and when I hear these stories about how these 1600 SAT 4.0 GPA kids who did research at MIT in the 9th grade got rejected, I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault somehow? I also feel as if they believe it’s my fault as well, that they hold some grudge against me.

This isn’t me trying to garner sympathy, truly, but this has been killing my mood recently. Anybody else feel this way?"

1eifoa2,Garber to serve as president until new search '26-'27.,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1eifoa2/garber_to_serve_as_president_until_new_search_2627/,23,2024-08-02 17:16:49+00:00,Inside128,"""Following a meeting of the governing boards earlier today, my colleagues and I are very pleased to let you know that Alan Garber, our interim president since January, will serve as president of the University through the end of the 2026-27 academic year. We plan to launch a full-scale search for his eventual successor in the late spring or summer of 2026.

After serving with distinction as Harvard’s provost for more than twelve years, Alan has done an outstanding job leading Harvard through extraordinary challenges since taking on his interim presidential duties seven months ago. We have asked him to hold the title of president, not just interim president, both to recognize his distinguished service to the University and to underscore our belief that this is a time not merely for steady stewardship but for active, engaged leadership.

Over the last seven months, and for years before that, Alan has led with a deep concern for all members of the Harvard community, a strong devotion to enduring university ideals, and a paramount commitment to academic excellence. At an especially demanding moment for higher education, Harvard is very fortunate to benefit from his intellectual acumen and breadth of interests, his integrity and fair-mindedness, his equanimity and empathy, his decades-long devotion to the University, his extensive knowledge of its people and parts, and his ardent belief in the power of higher education and research—and their potential to improve the lives of people and communities near and far. His time in Mass Hall has demonstrated his clear-eyed determination both to help the University chart a course through troubled waters and to affirm the primacy of the teaching, learning, and research at Harvard’s heart.

In conversations with many people across our community and beyond during the past weeks and months—including especially helpful recent consultations with each of the deans as well as an array of faculty and alumni leaders from the various schools—we have consistently heard praise for Alan’s qualities and how his leadership meets the current moment. People have highlighted his thoughtful and balanced judgment, his openness to different points of view, his even temperament in turbulent times, his concern for student well-being, his commitment to academic freedom and constructive dialogue, his recognition of diversity and inclusion as integral elements of academic excellence, his appetite for innovation, and his constant focus on the best interests of Harvard as a whole. Our recent consultations have strongly underscored the high regard in which Alan is held by a broad range of people who have watched him work and come to appreciate his strengths.

Alan is not only an admired academic leader but also a scholar and educator of exceptional reach. After graduating from Harvard College *summa cum laude,* he earned a PhD in Economics from Harvard and an MD with research honors from Stanford University. A member of the Stanford faculty for 25 years, he became a professor of medicine, economics, and health policy, and was founding director of Stanford’s Center for Health Policy and its Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, while also practicing as a physician in Palo Alto. Since returning to Harvard in 2011 to serve as provost, he has held faculty appointments in Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and the Economics Department in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As the longest-serving provost in Harvard’s history, responsible for overseeing academic activities throughout the institution and working to foster new connections across the schools, he gained singular insight into the full span of opportunities and challenges facing the University.

As noted, Alan will carry forward as president through the 2026-27 academic year and we will launch a full and wide-ranging search for his successor in the late spring or summer of 2026. We believe this plan will give Alan and his leadership team the opportunity to sustain and build momentum on a range of priorities and initiatives. It will also provide an ample interval for those of us on the Corporation to reflect, in consultation with others, on how best to approach the future presidential search, including how to ensure robust input from across Harvard and beyond.

As we all know, these remain challenging times. We have experienced significant divisions and pointed questions. We have hard work still ahead to reaffirm our core academic values and our collective focus on learning and scholarship. We must continue working to restore bonds of trust, to bridge divides, to combat forms of invidious hate and bias, and to foster a secure campus climate conducive to dialogue across differences. No less, we have more work ahead to amplify higher education’s contributions to the wider world and to shine light on why they matter.

Alan’s talents and experience position him well to guide us in this vital work. Along with my colleagues on the governing boards, I hope you will offer him your concerted support, and I thank all of you—faculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends—for all you do for Harvard.

Sincerely,  
Penny Pritzker

Honestly, I feel like Harvard should have followed what other universities are doing and start the semester with a week or two online. I know that sucks and is an unpopular opinion, but if Omicron is spreading fast and a good portion of students are going to test positive in the first few weeks, going online might make things easier for students and professors alike.

I’ve frankly just gotten really frustrated with how the professors here have been grading us in my classes and maybe I just had it easier at my high school or something and I’m bitching for nothing?

But I just think it’s wrong when one of my classes has a policy that only a certain percentage of the class can get an A, so a 96 was the cutoff for an A (which I BARELY made). I just don’t understand how most of my professors proclaim that they’re not trying to pit us against each other and grades don’t matter and then implement systems like this? I went into my math final with a 100% and left with a B+ because I did average (as in I did 4 questions perfectly and the other 2 had some mistakes in it) on the final so that corresponded to a two letter grade drop..?

I’ve just become really jaded especially given that my math professor barely taught us this entire year and so as a result I was teaching myself basically everything. I’m just like maybe this is the reality of college? I hate how everyone talks about grade inflation at Harvard because I’ve had the exact opposite experience, I’ve only had my grades deflated despite putting in my absolute best. I’ve become frustrated because I can’t even enjoy learning anymore because I’m stressing out so much about my grade.

I keep telling myself to be thankful that I’m at Harvard and I absolutely am and don’t get me wrong, I’ve had an amazing academic and personal experience thusfar, I’ve just found that I feel like the way most classes are graded here actively pit students against each other. I mean hell, I went to an underfunded high school and now I’m competing with kids for grades who went to schools like Exeter, Trinity, etc… it just doesn’t feel right."

I had my first research experience last semester and flopped on my research project. I basically got no work done and embarrassed myself in front of the professor that was advising me. This happened for two reasons: (1) I didn't manage time to work on the project properly and procrastinated on it, and (2) I wasn't that interested in the project to begin with. While I fully accept the responsibility for this failure and understand how I wasted the professor's time, I am a bit traumatized by this experience. The professor essentially told me and treated me like I was dumb and seemed apathetic from the start of the project when I asked for resources and feedback (it wasn't the professor's fault at all, but I'm saying what happened). I guess I'm a bit ashamed, as I left a bad impression on the professor, and I'm walking around a department where a professor thinks I'm incompetent and unintelligent.

I'm a good student and have excellent time management skills, in terms of managing heavy course loads at the very least. I also recognize that I failed because I was unaccustomed with the open-ended nature of research, and my lack of interest didn't help with that. I only did the research because I was looking for something to put on my resume rather than choosing something I genuinely wanted to explore and learn more about.

I think it is actually a good thing that this amounted to failure. First, I know that I need to be more organized next time to adequately allocate time to a long research project, and I know what things I can do to be make sure I'm spending the appropriate time and putting adequate effort. When I have to do my thesis, I now know that I can't procrastinate, and I need to properly structure my schedule to work on the project, so I can achieve the better results possible. Second, I now understand that it's important to choose research that you're interested in, so you're actually motivated to work on a project (this essentially applies to any work that I do) and don't just do things to put on your resume.

I know how to logically recover from this experience, but how do I mentally recover? I feel really embarrassed..."

I totally understand clubs having application processes so that they can ensure that they have members that are committed, but why do they have to be so damn selective?

Like, I can understand the selectivity for pre-professional organizations like CBE and HCCG, but for clubs like Harvard T4SG (Tech Social Good), which yes is still pre-professional but has a purpose of social impact, they are literally taking like 10% of their applicants?! Like, why? It's literally a club for social good and one of the most useful clubs to get real software engineering experience, but they reject tons of applicants. Who said performing social good should be so exclusive? Again, even in clubs like the aforementioned, I'm not saying to accept everyone, but does it really make sense to basically make the application process just another round of college admissions, especially if you're a club that promotes itself as doing something that is ""good""?

Wouldn't it make more sense to have more of a completion-based comp, that's meant to be challenging to complete to successfully filter out inadequate prospective members?"

I don't have any illusions of being a top student at Harvard. I view myself as being generally competent, well-rounded, and quicker in some subjects than others--and I'll work hard while I'm here--but I'm certainly no genius or creative savant. For those of you who were/are undergrad at Harvard, how did you navigate becoming an average student after being top of your class in high school? How did you overcome your impostor syndrome/jealousy to reap the intellectual and social benefits of being surrounded by so many unique and qualified people? Any general advice?

I feel like I should use a throwaway for this (I'm pretty identifiable) but that's okay. 

I'm a first year student (college). I'm also international and have a disability - I'm blind - which doesn't help with all of this. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't find my place here. Last semester I joined some extracurricular activities, The Crimson and a Model UN  type org (although it's not Model UN), but other than adding something to my resume, I don't feel like I have any real friends from them . . I've tried talking to random people at Annenberg and I actually have people I could call my friends, but more than friends they are just people I hang out with and that's it. I feel like the relationships don't go any further. 

I also feel like I'm not taking advantage of everything Harvard has to offer- my flights were canceled so I got here late and when I did I caught Covid two days later, so I haven't been able to get involved in my extracurriculars this semester by attending meetings and such, and I feel like everyone else is doing so much more than me, or that I'm missing out on participating in clubs where I could actually meet nice, down-to-earth people (I'm not saying the ones I'm in the people aren't nice, but I feel like everything is so superficial and competitive...). 

I don't even know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe advice or just knowing that I'm not the only one this is happening to, but it's all pretty overwhelming and I can't help but wonder if I really did the right thing by coming here. Back home I have real friends and family who miss me a lot, and here I have... well, Harvard, opportunities and so on, but I'm not as happy as I'd like to be and I really feel like I should do something to change that. I'd really appreciate any advice or comments or.... literally anything. Sorry for the long post and possible bad formatting, and if you read this far, thank you so, so much."

However, I’m wondering about other expenses I should expect to cover (such as pocket money, books, and transportation). Since I’m an international student, I’m not familiar with the costs in Boston. Any insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thank you!

————-

I’m new to Harvard

Hello! 

I’m taking the plunge and have accepted admittance to grad school this fall. Besides all the worry of financial stuff, I’m pretty excited for this awesome opportunity! 

Questions:
1. I’m from the southwest with mild winters, how are winters in MA? 

Well, my area in the southwest received a lot more snow than Cambridge! Haha I was actually excited to experience a huge snowfall out here but nothing! I went home for most of December and January so I’m not sure if I missed the coldest days, but I managed. Bought a thick jacket, gloves and headwear so the cold was manageable. I did, however, feel like I was getting more and more weary of the cold, wet, windy, and cloudy days as winter wore on. I think I may have gotten a little depressed, because at times I didn’t want to do anything other than stay at my apartment and sleep. Missed the sun and dry air! 

2. I’m thinking of driving, epic road trip! I want to have a car there so I can explore New England. Pros/cons? Like will I need to register with MA? 

So, I didn’t bring my car in July, but I did drive back in January! So, it was ok to not have a car, I got a term Charlie pass and they helped a lot going around mostly between Harvard and MIT. If I wanted to go further, like Walmart (can’t help it) I used the zip cars located outside my building or nearby. 

After a while, I felt very constricted to where I wanted to go — first by how long it took to get to places using the public transportation, secondly by how zip cars were not always available and it was getting expensive (and time restrictions on the cars). 

Bringing my car helped me feel like I had the freedom to go places. Parking — my building has a garage — so my car was nearby in a protected space (from weather too) but it was 2k for the semester. I got towed twice in Cambridge and got like 2 tickets. I got an ez-pass for tolls. I didn’t have to get MA plates either. 

Freedom! I went to New Hampshire (scary), providence, and lots of other places. I generally love to drive… back home we drive a lot. But winter months it’s pretty bleak around here haha

Traffic— first month was intimidating but after that, just being a courteous and respectful driver helps. Traffic isn’t all that bad, I’ve driven in LA, Japan and been in crazy traffic in Delhi!

3. School culture - what can I expect? I’m really laid back, and love to meet people— are people friendly? 

Best part of my school was my classmates and my professors. Everyone was so welcoming and supportive. So this ended being an awesome place for me. 

4. On campus or off campus housing? Was looking at the HU site for apartments, they are expensive. I also don’t want roommates or to stay in a dorm - I’m an older student who has had my share of that! 

I did not have a place to stay literally until about two weeks before I came out here. My window for the HUH lottery was the end of May and so nothing was available! There was an early window open in April, but I believe you had to sign a lease that started almost immediately and pay upfront. 

I’m lucky in certain ways, not the hitting the lotto lucky but luck with conditions— about two weeks before coming out, I checked the HUH website and there were two units available. One quickly disappeared and so I just selected the one that was left. 

It was a furnished studio and I’m so happy that it worked out for me. It’s quiet and next to the river. 

5. Elitism — how will I fit in as a middle/low income teacher? Are there Walmarts around? Lol

This was barely noticeable. My cohort were down to earth but some came from wealth. Didn’t matter at all. And I found my people at Walmart haha.

6. Best places to visit around Boston or to eat. My fam will probably come at some point would like to recommendations to get true east coast experience. 

Best experiences were the feast days at north end. Lots of places to eat around here as well. My family didn’t come out however. Haven’t had lobster roll yet :( or seafood for that matter. 

7. Down time— how much down time should I expect as a grad student? 

For my program August term was jam packed, but manageable. Fall term I took 19 credit hours. It was also manageable for me (it’s dependent on the courses you take) - had classes m-th so weekend was time to relax. 

Spring term I took just 12. And only had classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Lots of downtime! Again course dependent- I had a lot of projects I was working on though. 

8. Any other tips or advice! Thanks!

One thing weird is I got a grad meal plan thinking I would be able to use it starting August term— but it didn’t start till September. I had some food insecurity the first weeks of August. The receptions and such helped. My school finally is starting a food pantry for students - and I donated food because I went through that experience. 

I think my advice to my past self would be to not worry so much about fitting in, enjoy the short time at Harvard, make good connections and be yourself! "

>the perception that a namesake’s actions or beliefs were ‘abhorrent’ in the context of current values

What I think we are going to find is that virtually all White men of WASP heritage, for whom I'd assume most buildings at Harvard are named, were one or more of the following: racist, misogynist, anti-semitic, homophobic, ableist, classist, and anti-atheist. I seem to doubt that the views of, say Henry Dunster (President of Harvard from 1640-1654) would be tolerable in the areas of racial justice or women's rights.

I feel like this is going to turn into a circus. And nobody at Harvard actually believes that the ideals of Increase Mather are inculcated at Mather Steins. "

Recently there was a drugging incident at our university that inspired a huge campus protest that attracted local news. Students have been trying to force the Hopkins administration to implement a university-wide program that will prevent sexual violence at primarily Greek-held events— perhaps by having sober monitors drug test drinks on students’ behalf, or by having drinks distributed by a third party. But we aren't certain on any details yet, so we're open to ideas.

There’s been quite a bit of pushback from the university and so I’m really interested in connecting with your university’s sexual violence prevention club/team, as well as determining what y’all do to monitor or prevent druggings and alcohol-adjacent sexual violence. Like, do y’all offer free drink tests or toxicology screenings? What kind of accountability structures are in place to prevent sexual violence happening at large parties?

Please feel free to DM me. I’d love to work with you and prevent sexual violence at Hopkins. Thanks."
