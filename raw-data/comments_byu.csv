ptxa1h,hdz6ra0,"Interesting. I see a couple other noteworthy changes in here not being mentioned:

1. Institute no longer qualifies one to live in BYU housing. This means that neither UVU students nor recent graduates are allowed to live in BYU contracted off-campus housing.
2. BYU students with more than two semesters still *can* live in contracted off-campus housing, but the implication of ""limited space"" is that contractors are required to give preference to newer students.

I strongly suspect this will not affect rent prices as much as people here think it will. Yes, you now have more options, but Redstone, Aspen Ridge, Continental, and all the other property management companies still own most of the properties in the area. True, they won't have a captive market in the sense that students have to live in approved housing, but they also no longer have to follow off-campus housing regulations. Here are some things I would expect to see from the scummier management companies:

1. Expect to see rent stay about the same but with the addition of a monthly fee for apartment furnishings.
2. Crappy properties near the university (especially south of campus) that have previously been forced to provide some basic maintenance in order to keep their contracted housing status will probably get crappier.

Some other consequences I would expect to see in the immediate future:

1. Parking will become even more competitive. With more students choosing to live in Orem, Springville, and other parts of Provo to get cheaper rent, more students will have to commute to school. I'd find some carpool buddies or take advantage of the fact that your student ID doubles as a bus pass.
2. There will be a significant reshuffling of YSA stake and ward boundaries. With less contracted housing necessary, apartments will begin retooling themselves to offer spots to families, older single adults, and non-members. YSA wards near the university will stay much the same, but those a little further out will become somewhat more spread out (now it'll be a city block instead of a single apartment complex). Much further from the university, YSA wards will become more compact as students begin renting homes or apartments previously occupied by families and older adults.
3. There will be a very strong change in the culture for YSA wards. Contracted housing will comprise mostly of younger students, and off-campus, non-contracted housing will be mostly older students.",76,geekusprimus,3
193ouev,kharjwi,"Hi, BYU professor here who feels for you. This is a tough situation. My first bit of advice would be to be honest with yourself. If you are miserable and do not want to continue to follow the honor code, then it would probably be better to transfer. I don't know the specifics of your credit situation, but I know several students who have transferred and things have worked out great for them.   


Second, I also have had close relationships with several students who were not members of the church, but who had great experiences here. While theirs was a different situation, I think it speaks to the fact that if you feel you can continue to abide by the rules of the university, even though you don't believe as you once did, you can certainly still have a good experience here. We would love to still have you with us.   


Finally, on the subject of feeling lonely and like you don't have someone to talk to: I would definitely recommend talking to a counselor/therapist. This is a difficult period in life. You are certainly experiencing many stressors. I have personally found that counseling has helped me very much. You might also consider talking to your bishop. I have worked with many bishops and they are almost universally kind and generous people who often understand much better than you might think. I don't say this out of an attempt to persuade you to change your opinion of the church. I do so simply to note that there is a person who cares about you that you can talk to.",123,New-Slide9507,1
193ouev,khbkiqe,"I'm a former BYU professor who is also a former member of the Church (had a faith crisis/transition after I left BYU for unrelated reasons). I'm part of the Free BYU group (which tries to improve the systems which make things so precarious for students who have a faith crisis/transition while at BYU). I also co-founded an interfaith dialogue group with the BYU religious dept where we dialogued with BYU religion professors, BYU faculty (like counselors), and BYU administration for many years on faith crisis and member/former member relationships, especially as it relates to BYU students. [If anyone cares to vet any of this information I'm happy to provide references or links which should make it easy.]

Lots of great advice here already from everyone about pros and cons of leaving vs. staying. That's a very tough decision. I've heard stories about people who are really glad that they left. I've also heard of people who have had reasonably good experiences staying and making the best of it. I'm confident you'll make the right decision for you.

If you were to stay (again, not recommending one course of action over the other), here are some things that can help:

1. *Check out the [BYU Survival Guide](https://byusurvivalguide.com/)* - lots of great info in here.
2. *Consider connecting with the underground BYU group of non-believing students.* I discuss the group a bit more and how you can get in contact with the group in [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/18obqhn/byu_is_killing_me/kei3qdf/).
3. *Definitely talk with a BYU Counselor.* BYU Counseling has confirmed to us that counselors are bound by client confidentiality (i.e., it cannot influence your ecclesiastical endorsement in any way). One of my good friends was a BYU Counselor/Professor. He estimates that 1/3 of the students he was counseling were dealing with faith crisis issues on some level. So, this is both safe and recommended! If you stay, you should definitely do this! Our dialogue group talked with all the counselors in a panel discussion and I got the sense that they are very committed to helping and supporting students who may have gone through a faith transition.
4. *Talking with your Bishop about a faith transition is risky.* I love /u/New-Slide9507's and /u/Admirable-Stand9964's advice generally. I agree that most Bishops are incredibly kind hearted and only want the best for their students. However, **if you speak with a Bishop about a faith transition at BYU you run a real risk of not getting an ecclesiastical endorsement and/or expulsion** (worst case, without a transcript) because there are _some_ Bishops who are more hard-line. You can go talk to the Free BYU facebook group if you want to hear more of these kinds of stories. [/u/New-Slide9507 and /u/Admirable-Stand9964, I would encourage you to formally or informally petition BYU to make it _structurally more safe_ for students to confide in their Bishop so that you can _responsibly_ recommend this course of action to students who have gone through a faith transition. You cannot guarantee that a student's Bishop will not withhold an endorsement if a student confides to losing belief, and there are plenty of examples of students who have lost endorsements for this, so even though it's not likely, it's still a real risk.]

s8p27w,hthldi8,"“The U.S. Department of Education has launched an investigation into Brigham Young University and how it disciplines its LGBTQ students to determine whether the private religious school is violating their civil rights.

This type of federal scrutiny is surprising and rare, especially with church-owned schools like BYU — it typically happens only in places where there are believed to be potential systemic or serious issues.

“It’s really significant that investigators are stepping in now,” said Michael Austin, a BYU alumnus and vice president at the University of Evansville, a private Methodist school in Indiana. “It means there’s some reason to think the university has gone beyond the religious exemptions it has and is discriminating even beyond those.”

The investigation of BYU officially started late last year and it concerns Title IX, the federal law that protects against discrimination on the basis of sex in schools.

Federal investigators were first alerted to a possible issue at BYU, which is operated by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, after a complaint was filed in response to changes made to the school’s strict Honor Code in spring 2020.

At the time, the university had removed a controversial section from the rules that banned “homosexual behavior.” Some students celebrated, openly coming out as queer after, they said, school officials told them it was OK. But a few weeks later, the school clarified that same-sex partnerships would still be prohibited, even if the ban was no longer expressly written.

Those who act against that instruction by holding hands or kissing, according to administrators, could continue to face discipline. LGBTQ students protested, saying they felt gaslit and tricked into coming out.

The investigation, headed by the Office of Civil Rights within the Department of Education, will examine whether such actions by BYU are allowable because it is a private school or if they violate LGBTQ students’ rights, by disciplining them more harshly than heterosexual peers who don’t face the same consequences for similar romantic behaviors.

A spokesperson for the Department of Education did not return a request for comment on the investigation. The Salt Lake Tribune has submitted a public records request for a copy of the original complaint.

University spokesperson Carri Jenkins said in a statement that she believes the federal office will find BYU is properly exempt and within its rights to enforce the church’s policies against same-sex relationships.

“BYU is exempt from application of Title IX rules that conflict with the religious tenets of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,” Jenkins said. “BYU does not anticipate any further action by OCR on this complaint.”

But the investigation comes after the school has repeatedly been in the national spotlight in the past two years for how it treats LGBTQ students and as many have been pushing for change.

Last year, several students signed onto a lawsuit, alleging discrimination there because of their identifies. One is a recent graduate who is lesbian and said she lost her job at the school because she didn’t look “feminine enough” to her boss. And a group of students spoke out against the school’s policies by lighting the iconic “Y” on the mountain above BYU in rainbow colors.

In response, the university has now banned protests on that property. It also refused take any public action after a professor called a gay student a term associated with an anti-Christ.

And, last fall, a top-ranking apostle of the LDS Church came to campus and criticized faculty members and students who challenge the faith’s teachings on same-sex marriage. He said they should instead take up their intellectual “muskets” to defend “the doctrine of the family and ... marriage as the union of a man and a woman” — even if that costs the school some “professional associations and certifications.” The school’s accreditation has an upcoming review in April.

Some hope the federal investigation might finally end the crossfire.

Religious exemptions

BYU began receiving religious exemptions from Title IX in 1976, becoming the first school to ever do so and leading the charge for private universities across the country to follow.

In a strongly worded letter to the Department of Education at the time, then-BYU President Dallin Oaks bristled at the federal government having any power to control or limit BYU, according to an article about Title IX in higher education from the Kansas Law Review.

The president maintained that as a private religious school, BYU had the right to ask employees and prospective students about their marital status, if they had children out of wedlock (with the faith standing strongly against premarital sex) or if they had previously had an abortion, “because [BYU] condemns promiscuity,” according to Oak’s letter. It also stated it could enforce a dress code, with different requirements for men and women.

Oaks wasn’t asking for permission, but rather notifying the department, which acknowledged the letter by giving out formal exemptions.

Those exemptions continue to apply to BYU today, among 15 total exemptions that the school now has related to sexuality and gender expression.

Its protected actions include the ability to enforce its own preferences while recruiting and admitting students and giving out financial aid. For instance, if a student is openly gay, BYU is permitted under the law to deny him a scholarship. The school can also limit the use of bathrooms based on sex assigned at birth.

“Technically, BYU is allowed to discriminate in those areas,” Austin said.

What’s at question with the new investigation, Austin believes, is whether those exemptions allow BYU to discipline LGBTQ students beyond that, based on the faith’s teachings.

For example, he asks: Can the school punish a gay student for holding hands, when that’s not directly related to education? Is it OK for the university to expel a transgender student for doing something that would not get a heterosexual student into trouble?

Students must agree to uphold the Honor Code when they come into BYU, Austin notes, signing a document vowing to do so. But if the ban on “homosexual behavior” isn’t written in that any more, can students still be held to that?

Current university President Kevin Worthen wrote a letter to the Department of Education last November, shortly after receiving notice of the investigation, saying it still applies.

“All BYU students, faculty, administrators, and staff,” he wrote, “agree to the Church Educational System Honor Code and thereby ‘voluntarily commit to conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ.’”

But Austin wonders if removing that section in February 2020 changed the way the Department of Education views the school’s rules.

How students feel

Carolyn Gasset is the president of the unofficial club of LGBTQ students at BYU known as USGA (Understanding Sexuality, Gender and Allyship).

Currently, its members are not allowed to meet on campus. That is allowed under the exemptions BYU has to Title IX because the school has express permission to ban associations from its private property.

But Gassert believes the school disciplining students differently based on who they are attracted to does not similarly qualify. That is especially the case, she says, now that it’s not in the Honor Code.

“If you gave someone a contract and then introduce a clause and then didn’t have them re-sign it, that would be illegal,” she said.

Madi Hawes, a BYU sophomore who is bisexual and uses she/they pronouns, said the investigation reminds her of when the LDS Church was being criticized for not allowing Black men to hold the priesthood. That was changed with a revelation by leaders of the faith in 1978 after immense public pressure.

As a student of color, Hawes hopes the new investigation could lead to change at BYU for the LGBTQ community, another marginalized group.

Hawes also questions BYU’s strict policy against LGBTQ students expressing any romantic feelings physically, when the church’s manual on same-sex attraction doesn’t seem to require the same.

Instead, the faith’s instructions focus on “sexual purity” for everyone, those who are heterosexual or LGBTQ. Its guidance says: “Sexual relations between a man and woman who are not married, or between people of the same sex, violate one of our Father in Heaven’s most important laws and get in the way of our eternal progress.”

That accords with the law of chastity of the faith, which Hawes believes is reasonable to ask students at BYU to follow. But the guidelines don’t mention anything about LGBTQ people not kissing or holding hands. She believes the school, in disciplining LGBTQ students for those actions, is not acting in accordance with the faith and the faith’s religious exemptions for education shouldn’t then apply.

Cal Burke, a recent BYU student who is gay, added that he’s disappointed the school is framing its stance as one of religious freedom. He sees it as clear discrimination.

“Even if queer students believe the gospel and keep the rules, BYU will not protect them,” he said. “I am a believer, and I did everything right, and BYU still abandoned me when push came to shove.”

Last year, a professor publicly called Burke a Book of Mormon term associated with an anti-Christ. The school declined to say whether it would take action against the professor. Burke believes that goes against the school’s own policy, with the Honor Code requiring that faculty and students “respect others, including the avoidance of profane and vulgar language.”

He feels BYU picks and chooses what it wants to enforce, creating an environment that’s particularly difficult for LGBTQ students who don’t know if they’ll be turned in for something minor.”",103,-lonely_rose-,1
s8p27w,hti2rej,"When I got let go because I was honest with my bishop about my sexual activity and thus out of college I went into the military to make things work financially. Well the military has a different set of social skills than most LDS homes raise you to understand. So it was challenging and I was the perfect prey.  I wish I could have just stayed in environments I understood socially but the HCO is the HCO and I did agree…

Just last year when a BYU law student decided to have premarital sex with me (and also be the likely source of an STD I then got) I said he should be tested in addition to knocking it off with the social media virtue signaling. He blocked me but being Lds…we have mutual friends from across the LDS community. I can see anything he posts from mutual friends who know what a hypocrit he is. No I don’t like being a nark. But why is it ok for him to lie to his bishop and the HCO and get rewarded by staying… whereas I was honest and got punished? Rewarded for lying? That’s the new HCO way. 🤷‍♀️ Well he really loved telling everyone else to step it up spiritually and was being mean frankly. So I did nark on him to the  HCO. If that’s his standard he could have it. I just want to know why he is still there not missing a beat while it seems other students got the boot because their partner was the same gender. I wonder if the investigating team knows that happened? Why do some students get one punishment and then others get a free pass? Maybe it’s time they make the honor code about personal honor and not systematic discipline. 

I should have never been kicked out of BYU for being honest. If someone is found committing their own “sin” they should get the same understanding and forgiveness that wealthy law student is getting. There is a lot of room for improvement at BYU. BYU deserves some constructive criticism. It’s sad they need to get it from the fed vs. being the example for the nation but that’s one example of why this is happening.",36,FreeTapir,2

ly2nly,gpqqat3,"A girl in my math class (who has the integrity to live by her agreement to abide by the honor code, as far as I'm aware) came out as bisexual to all of us in a post about Rainbow Day, informing us about the opportunity to support the LGBTQ+ community by wearing rainbow today, and how it would make her feel loved. Not owning rainbow attire, I responded with a rainbow emoji to show her, personally, as an individual who has an actual human relationship with her, that she is loved. That's my way of showing ""support."" But I do not feel comfortable parading around campus with rainbow in support of the larger LGBTQ+ community. (Primarily because I don't like the multitudinous interpretations the rainbow banner embodies. It's too loud of a symbol for me to carefully and meaningful communicate my intended message with it in public. I'd rather just decide for myself how to show people love, in ways that make sense to me.)

I'm glad that this day successfully showed some people that they are loved. Truly. However, I can't help but think that those who are concerned for the sake of their fellow man about the loosening of moral standards of society struggle to speak, in fear of receiving hate.

I saw a post on Instagram saying repeatedly that ""support is support"", basically implying that if you're not comfortable waving a rainbow banner around, marching in lockstep with everything that is mainstream, it's because you're not keeping your covenants to love others. (i.e. you are a hateful or ignorant person) The false dichotomy frustrates me deeply.

I guess it just feels unfair that people aren't even willing to have a conversation about how ""support"" can be legitimately defined in this context. Or the fact that two moderately ""loving"" people can respectfully disagree about what it means to ""support"" the LGBTQ+ community. Did the prophet Noah show ""support"" to the people of his day when he preached repentance and warned of the flood? Isn't that the greatest expression of God's love?? Jesus atoned for our sins so that we could repent and be \*\*clean\*\* AND so that he could succor us in our weakness. It's great that he knows how hard life is for LGBTQ+ people, but the fact is life is hard for everyone, and the need to repent isn't magically waived just because ""it hurts"". Every stinkin' last one of us needs to repent and align ourselves with God's will. It breaks my heart that people leave Jesus and the church and turn into straight up atheists because of the culture (that is thankfully being challenged by things like Rainbow Day) that they aren't welcome because they're gay. (Or for any other reason.)

On the other hand, the stupid flyers that showed rainbow raindrops being deflected by an umbrella ""in defense of the Family Proclamation"" is anything but loving and inclusive of people who are struggling to feel God's love and the love of others. Maybe the people who made those flyers genuinely (erroneously) thought that Rainbow Day was an affront on God's revealed order of marriage between man and woman. But to those with half a brain, Rainbow Day is about showing LGBTQ+ people that society doesn't hate them, especially within the Church. Do the people at Deznat really think that telling ""apostates"" to ""go to hell"" will be taken as an invitation to ""come unto Christ""?

I definitely think the Family Proclamation needs to be defended, but I also think it's possible to do so without trampling on the broken hearts of our LGBTQ+ brothers and sisters. Some of you might think I'm ""missing the point"" by even bringing up the fact that, yes, the Family Proclamation needs to be defended, but frankly no one can tell me what ""the point is"" when I live in this world, too, and things affect me personally. I'll decide for myself what ""the point is"", thank you very much.

All of this said, in my heart of hearts, I genuinely hope God would be anything but supportive of me if I chose to ignore his commandments. I strive to be supportive of people (LGBTQ+ and otherwise) in their efforts to improve upon their mortal probation and come unto Christ, because in my mind, there is no better way to support a fellow child of God, for that is how I truly see others.

lyl3il,gptcjik,"As a side thought: I honestly think the beard rule might be done away with this year. Hear me out:

The committee on race made, along with their other recommendations, a recommendation to review campus policies which may disproportionately affect people of different races. This plays into removing the beard rule for two reasons: 

1) pseudofolliculitis, the primary reason you can qualify for a beard card, primarily affects black people (upwards of 60% of black men according to a brief internet search), meaning they have to go through the painful process of getting a beard card at much higher rates (and they have to pay for it).

2) some races have thicker facial hair than others. I'm of Irish/English descent, and when I shave it takes around two days for my 5 o'clock shadow to really become noticeable due to my light hair color. On the other hand, I have friends of Italian/Middle Eastern descent who have super thick, coarse, dark facial hair. They would look like they haven't shaved for 3 days if they waxed their face. That means that they will get turned away from the Testing Center even if they shaved in the Testing Center bathroom. Disparate impact.",35,None,1

The only way to opt out is to physically go IN PERSON and request a cancellation of charge, and it has to be done before the add/drop deadline or else you’re screwed. 

If you’re studying away from campus, there’s no way to escape this. 

Additionally, according to the [faq](https://www.byustore.com/student-first), this will continue every year starting with the freshman class so that by 2023 every BYU student will be forced into this program. 

I’m going to be contacting the bookstore and STRONGLY ask them to discontinue this. I plead with everyone who sees this to do the same. Start a petition, call, or write the administration.

And to all incoming freshman, the bookstore should be your last resort, not your first option. You can find textbooks online for only 20%-30% of the bookstore’s selling price most of the time. I can’t remember a time when I actually bought a book from the bookstore after my first semester at byu.

I also worry about BYU's trajectory. It seems some want to secularize the school while also retaining the Church sponsorship, which seems contradictory. I may get downvoted to oblivion for saying this, but I think BYU should remain religious and the students should put Christ-like love for each other before political activism.

While I struggle with seeing BYU push to make the university more ""orthodox"", I think the church is perfectly within its rights to do so. Within the orthodox framework, it seems to make sense. If the LDS church really does hold the ""keys of salvation"", and if it is fully incumbent on church members to be *maximally* devoted to the church, then making BYU be more deeply orthodox and church-focused is sensible. If it is true that there are adversarial/wordly forces that are trying to bring people in the church down, then policing boundaries between the secular and the spiritual seems to be the only option.

My grief, then, is because I *don't* think the LDS Church (or anyone) holds keys to salvation, and I don't think there is an adversary who is looking to drag people into misery. I think the world just... is. There are ""worldly"" things that I think *are* harmful, and worth pushing back against. But, I don't share the LDS theological framework for justifying these beliefs.

Perhaps more centrally: I think I was a *good* member of the BYU community, even while I was privately planning on stepping away from the church. I gave liberally of my time and talents to help math students learn and grow. I was a friend to those in need. I was not perfect, by any stretch. But, I feel like I could still fit in by just doing my part to help others, even though my religious beliefs were different. It makes me sad to see BYU move in a direction that would have made it less likely (or impossible) for me to be a member of the community and also honest about my beliefs. I don't feel like my contributions to the BYU community were thwarted by my personal non-belief. If anything, that only lead me to re-focus my attention on the meaningful things I still share with LDS church members.",22,hjrrockies,3

1ee8yya,lfcwprp,"A College degree is not always about a direct to job path. Yes, STEM majors often find jobs in their field but the humanities adds value to many fields. Someone who majored in humanities is often a better persuasive writer and can parlay that into being successful in a business workplace. Creative degrees can also provide able problem solvers, project managers, and innovators but it is all about how you sell yourself. My college roommate got a degree in English and people always asked him what he was going to do with that degree. His Answer was, “to be educated.” He works happily as a bike mechanic and earns enough to live comfortably with his family but it was his education that gave him confidence to get the job he has. 

Perhaps what we need more is to emphasize to any getting a degree to take the capstone careers in your field class to learn both how to market yourself and what options you have. 

Finally for anyone finding themselves unemployed despite a degree consider attending your Ward or Stake Self Reliance Class on employment. Learning to how to create a resume and to be confident in interviews is something anyone can benefit from. 

Finally remember that in the work world women not matter their education are at a disadvantage and in Utah more so as there is a lot of systematic hostility to a woman being anything but a homemaker or in the service industry. In Utah too the assumption is that those high paying jobs need to go to a man because he’s the one who needs to support a family and somehow a woman taking that work would be wrong. Additionally businesses across the globe also see women as a liability because if they get pregnant then the investment in that employee is down the drain and she may never come back to work. Things need to change direction sure but this is why so many SAHM end up getting into things like Doterra or Amway or Mary Kay to make ends meet because that has become socially acceptable. 

So for female students. Learn how to market yourself and build confidence but do something you can be passionate about not just something that makes money. That passion can help you open doors as you exhibit confidence as you enter the career field. Best of luck as you navigate the future.",26,eltraveso,3

10lyuhq,j60bdvi,"A lot of people have made some good points already. I would like to add that the title of the devotional is, ""Why a Church?"" This is a fantastic, interesting premise for a devotional. I was very excited for this speech when I attended on Tuesday.

But the answer the speaker gives is not satisfactory. It starts well, explaining that being a regular part of a church can help us connect with God more than worshipping without one. But after that, it seems he forgets what kind of person is asking this question. Instead of helping people to realize what a church can do for them, he castigates them for even thinking that the church might have flaws. That's not helpful.

I find great fault with this speaker's proposal that we replace ""the church"" with ""Jesus Christ"" in our concerns about our church. It's not that I question whether church leaders are invested in divine authority. It's just that I know that the church, the institution itself, run by men, has done bad things with terrible justifications that [it no longer accepts](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng). By asking us to replace ""the church"" with ""Jesus Christ"" in all our criticisms and concerns, **this speaker is asking us not to blame humanity for our sins, but to blame God**. This idea, to my mind, verges on blasphemy, and I can only accept it from this speaker because I do not think he understands what he is saying.

I hope someday soon church leaders will begin to understand why people have these kinds of concerns, but until then I guess we just have to keep dealing with ill-thought ideas like this.",36,WiJaMa,2
10lyuhq,j5zyz4p,"In my opinion Church culture has become more and more authoritarian recently. Maybe it's always been that way, maybe I'm just noticing it more at this point in my life. Anything but blind loyalty to the Church leadership is viewed as apostasy. To me it looks like a bunch of fallible, mortal men trying to hide behind a facade of divine power. People who want a strong central leadership may be drawn to that, but it's turned away people like me who want transparency from leadership. 

Any concerns about Church leadership is eventually met with ""if you had enough faith then these things wouldn't matter."" Not only is that dismissive, but it's manipulative and abusive. Cult-like. 

My individual concerns have no way of affecting Church leadership anyway, it's not like they have any direct accountability to the membership and the membership has no way of enforcing accountability. So my doubts and concerns don't even really matter in the grand scheme of things. But I'm not allowed to voice my individual concerns according to Church culture, because my voice may lead other people away. So instead of addressing concerns, Church culture just instead seeks to quash all concerns at the source and prevent any kind of collective idea or group that goes against leadership. It's an authoritarian hellhole. Conform or you're going to hell.

And I just know a bunch of ""defenders of the faith"" are going to respond to this post and point how I'm wrong and the Church is great and the faithful are chosen to defend against evil, etc. Those are the type of people who love the authoritarianism in the Church. They have zero empathy for people with doubts and just want to feel morally superior. The modern day equivalent of Pharisees with performative morality.",36,ShinakoX2,3

The supervisor of my supervisor was cheap. They didn’t buy us new printers often and had us (n00bz) repair old ones and try them out before getting new ones. And often the new ones came from BYU surplus used and we still had to repair them. 

There are 4 people on the team and they’re in charge of all tech support for the BYU Print and Mail building PLUS these printers PLUS most of the print service desks located on campus. It’s a hellish workload.

Printers literally suck as a technology. It’s a cliche in movies to have issues with thw office printer because they seriously just SUCK. 

BYU has a contract for harder repairs, troubleshooting, and maintenance to be done by a KonicaMinolta tech who has to travel through all of southern and central Utah. They won’t give us another tech because we don’t own enough printers or something (I can’t really remember why, it’s been five years). 

Rest assured though, that I tried so hard to fix these problems. I streamlined our ticketing system, made submitting student tickets possible, threw out a ton of old print stations nobody used to decrease our load, and vouched for putting brand new printers in. I spent a summer troubleshooting problems with those new printers and there were STILL issues with them once the semester started. Printers seriously SUCK and so do idiot students like me with only on the job training.

I still shake my fist when I go to print and end up wandering through three buildings to find one that works. Some of those printers are absolutely haunted.

wr21sc,ikqtlc9,"I suspect the beard policy could be quickly changed if a large enough segment of the student body simply refused to shave. Unlike other unpopular policies, there's no doctrinal basis for it. 1000 students standing in line at the testing center during finals being denied tests would force the administration to either cave, or make a lot of unpopular headlines. But like most campaigns of this nature, it comes down to a game of chicken. They can ignore 100 people, but not 10,000. Once the movement hit a critical mass, it would win.

The problem, of course, is getting that critical mass. I think the reason such a trivial issue hasn't come to a head until now is exactly that it is so trivial. We all recognize that the policy is ridiculous, but it's trivial enough that it's not really worth risking all that much to protest. LGBTQ issues are far more worthy of protest, but also a much harder hill to climb.

Transparency is a great value, and I hope Church culture adopts it even more in the future, but that would be an extreme application of it!

When I attended BYU as a Psychology student, I heard of conversion therapy at BYU happening in the past. I was told it was a bad idea, didn't work, was discontinued, and is illegal now. I don't remember where I heard that, and I don't know if my source was complete or even accurate. I found it disturbing to hear about, but I was glad it had been stopped.",62,frontierpsychy,2
xfvp6h,iop0ih0,"I'm currently at BYU and I can relate a lot to what you’re saying. A couple of months ago I went through the same process of “awakening.” 

You just realize that things aren’t as you thought they were. Anyway, I’m glad that with the help of my wife and much effort to reconcile my testimony with everything I was discovering about church history, I decided to stay in the church, and now I feel that my testimony grew to be even stronger than before.

The whole situation of President Oaks saying that those “recovery gay therapy” didn't happen when he was president of BYU is so messed up. He straight lied or just got the dates very, very confused. That's just another reminder that prophets and apostles are men subject to bias and weaknesses like we all are. 

Now, I wouldn't say that BYU and the church are hiding this information because if you go to lib.byu.edu you can find all the studies from 1976 explaining the experiments and things they tried. So... Yeah... Super weird and messed up. I agree with you on asking why would the lord allowed these horrendous things to happen in his university.  Whether we like it or not, society has a huge influence on the church, because the church is being guided by mortal people like you and me that live in this world and adopt worldly costumes and practices. And back then, everyone was experimenting with gays :/

Once we learn from this and many other things that happened in church history, it’s normal to feel betrayed and automatically lose trust in the church and its leaders. However, I think we tend to emotionally react to these findings and we make important decisions thinking emotionally. Once we chill out a little bit and sit with that discomfort, we start thinking more rationally. In my case, I came to understand that BYU and the Church won't ever cry out from the roof of the buildings about all the things they did badly. No one does that. Along with that, I appreciated that BYU still has public records of all the studies and experiments with gay students. They could have perfectly deleted everything but they didn't. 

Comparing BYU and the church now with what they were back then, we can see massive improvement.

It sucks if you aren't necessarily interested in the things that are popular with adults your age, but often dating is a game that you have to learn to play.

It also helps to get even a part-time job that has a lot of people your age as you will naturally make friends with them and they all hang out anyways. I served at a restaurant all through college and made tons of friends and met tons of people.

Also, if you're only 23, you shouldn't be worried about the age gap of 4 years to 19. That's a you thing imo.

You need to stop feeling like there is an expected timeline for finding your person.  If you are feeling rushed and pressured into dating, that will show in the way you interact with people and you will end up coming off as desperate.  Your 20s are a time of racing around trying to establish yourself and never quite feeling like you are there yet.  Be really honest with yourself and ask yourself what your motivations are for getting married.  Is it because you feel you ought to and you are being driven by the pressure around you?  

I spent so much time trying to date and feeling like I was aging out of the dating pool at BYU.  I tried all the available apps at the time, went to as many social activities as I could and just never felt like I could find anything that worked.  I’m a pretty solid introvert and forcing myself that far out of my comfort zone didn’t make me magically find my person, I’m sure people could tell I was not being fully genuine and that is something that does not help with attracting people.  

I didn’t meet my partner until I was 30 after years of trying the brute force dating method I kind of got exhausted and started trying to understand myself better.  I worked on myself, went to therapy and had to swallow a lot of pride about how I viewed myself and the assumptions I made about other people.  I learned to be ok with the idea of not getting married and this allowed me to be comfortable just being myself.  And you know what?  Thats what my partner was most attracted to.  I had to let go of my ego and that insecurity that made me feel I was incomplete until I was married.

The thing is, I would still say I am incomplete without my partner.  But not because she completed me when we first met.  I was already complete as a person, but as a couple we have grown beyond our individual selves.

Good for you for trying to improve things. Can I suggest that you also make just as big of a deal when someone at the university says or does something that is inclusive? There are a lot of faculty and students there trying hard to be inclusive and genuinely caring. If you were to make a big deal out of some of their efforts, it would shine a spotlight on good behavior--it would inspire others to behave similarly.

I think one thing is that BYU has seen [net grade deflation](https://gradeinflation.com/) while other schools have inflated.   


To be honest there's a ton of nonsense majors in colleges these days that aren't designed towards specific careers. This is true of BYU, too. I think people just replace the partying with building families or other things. Also, they just decide to have shit grades. People make bad choices at every institution. It's 18 year olds learning how to be adults. Doesn't mean that UC Berkeley is less prestigious for it. My friend who transferred from UW is very serious about school and at least for her, BYU has been nicer to her academically.  


Just my two-cents.

15io8r7,juw6vo1,"Your rationale comes off as judgy, but I do agree that BYU (generally) provides a good education. I was accepted to a top engineering school for my masters and visited the school to meet with some professors and try to get some funding. Once of the professors I met with was impressed in my GPA *because* I was from BYU. He acknowledged that some schools inflate their grades, but he said BYU was one school where if you got an A in a class, you legitimately earned it. 

We had a professor in the ME department that did his Ph.D. at MIT. He was always quick to remind people that, in his opinion, the education we were getting at BYU was comparable to that from MIT, Stanford, etc. Especially with engineering where almost every school uses the same books for the core classes, the differences come down to research funding, school resources (which are often tied to research funding), and the alumni network. 

Now, these are isolated incidents, but I will say that in my experience, BYU is respected by people who know what they're talking about. And if I ever hear anyone scoff and assume that I'm somehow less of an engineer because I went to BYU, I know that they're biased or perhaps ignorant. And I try to remind myself that good engineers can easily come from other schools as well.

u1g939,i4cijyz,"Seems like a pretty insightful and fairly in-depth treatment. There are a few mentions of some small points of doctrine that are inaccurate but easily misunderstood, something that I think you may have experience with in covering Judaism. I don’t think they’re a very big deal. I think the part that sticks with me most is when you pointed out that in the production, the point is that God is silent. That’s a part of Judaism that’s so antithetical to how our own doctrine views our relationship with God that it can be hard to wrap my mind around it.

One of the recurring motifs in the Bible that becomes a bigger pattern in the context of Biblical and Book of Mormon scripture combined is God leading a chosen people out of a wicked or hostile place to a promised land. We see that in the examples of Abram leaving Ur and becoming Abraham, Moses and the Israelites leaving Egypt, and the return from Babylon, but also in the stories of Jared, his brother, and their families fleeing the Tower of Babel, Lehi and his family leaving Jerusalem and journeying to the New World, and Alma and Limhi leading their people back to the land of Zarahemla. Similarly, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has the distinction of being the only religion in the history of the United States to have been subjected to an extermination order. We were forced out, arrived in Utah, and, if you’ll pardon the expression, we made the desert bloom like a rose. Being led to a promised land is a powerful symbol to us, and it links with our doctrine that people that choose to make covenants with God and therefore become part of His chosen people will eventually arrive in the ultimate promised land, the Celestial Kingdom.

This motif is also present in *Fiddler* when the entire Jewish community in Anatevka is forced to head for less hostile lands. I think that’s part of why the ending is so poignant for members of the church. However, I think we do tend to overlook the fact that God is not a character in *Fiddler*. He doesn’t speak, He doesn’t influence events, and for the purposes of the plot, He may as well be Tevye‘s imaginary friend. Your article helped open my eyes to just how much more deeply important the preservation of tradition is in Judaism compared to my own faith. Correct me if I’m wrong, but this is the impression I got, which is that to us, tradition is very distinct from doctrine, and while correct traditions are good because they help to point us to God, doctrine is supercedingly important, to the point that doctrinally incorrect traditions are a spiritual danger. In Judaism, however, *the preservation of tradition is the whole point*. That’s all there is that’s left, because God no longer speaks to His chosen people.",10,reasonable_doubt1776,3

>Of all the schools or businesses to be doing this right now, it is so offensive and backwards that a school that claims to follow God would treat community members this way...

BYU happens to be sponsored by a church whose leaders have publicly endorsed the vaccines and encouraged all eligible members to get vaccinated as soon as they can. Requiring tests or proof of vaccination is a natural extension of that policy, particularly as public events that cram hundreds or thousands of people into a single room are ideal circumstances for a super-spreader event.

>This is exactly the way Satan would operate and good people would stand up to this!

This is a dumb, intellectually lazy argument. The Church also only allows people into temples who have active recommends, which are much harder to obtain than vaccines or COVID tests. Does that make them like Satan for restricting outside access?

>I have invested much of my life to creating and nurturing this child and chose to help my child attend this school whom I actually (yes stupidly) trusted...

So? BYU gets thousands of applicants a year than they have spots for. It's a privilege, not a right, to attend BYU (or any other postsecondary institution). BYU owes this person nothing.

>I am standing up and pushing back for all students, all adults, and parents and fighting against discrimination and segregation.

Another intellectually lazy statement. Refusing to comply with public health guidelines doesn't make you an oppressed member of society any more than being denied entry to a movie theater for refusing to put on a shirt is grounds for a lawsuit; it just makes you an idiot.

qk3jtp,hiugwzy,"My advice is to spend some time pondering and praying about three things: your testimony of Christ, your testimony of the COJCOLDS, and your testimony of your Ward. When I was closer to your age, I was prone to feeling that if Jesus was real, then my home teachers ought to actually care about me, and that if my Sunday School teacher taught a good lesson that must mean the atonement is real. I don't believe either of those things. I'm all for giving people as much grace as possible, but sometimes your Ward just sucks. Sometimes people around you are idiots, and sometimes BYU culture makes you want to run away screaming. These things can make it a lot harder to be excited about church, but they're not worth ditching (or joining) a religion over.

As an ""old man"" (comparatively) I like to say that I actually believe fewer things than I used to, but I'm more firmly rooted to Christ. There have been times in life where I've just had to hunker down with that knowledge and wait until I was able to resolve some other things.

Whatever you do, I wish you well. Don't let anyone convince you that your value as a person has anything to do with your activity in the church or what university for attend.",29,TomPastey,1
qk3jtp,hiutr0e,"As someone who struggles with church faith and things like that for reasons that are literally out of my own control (I'm part of the LGBTQ community much to the dismay of what feels like every single leader), I've found that it's just best to find some friends that go to that ward and sit with them. Being near people you like makes the whole experience a lot more bearable even if it hurts. It's just a few more years and then you can truly decide for yourself, no strings attached, if this church is truly for you or not. You got this!",28,Wifijoe,2
qk3jtp,hivsqnv,"The BYU survival guide ( https://byusurvivalguide.com/ ) is a useful resource for your situation. BYU does not supply any support or resources for students who lose their faith for any reason, so it can be isolating and difficult to keep going, especially when leaving isn't a realistic solution or when trauma is involved.

If you want to regain a testimony, whether in the church or outside it, I'd recommend spending time outside of church discovering what parts of your religious upbringing and beliefs you value, and what kind of person you want to be. 

If the church helps you to live those values and be that person, great! If not, that's great too! The church doesn't have a monopoly on spirituality or truth or goodness. It's okay to find what you need in other places, in other churches or inside yourself. It's not a betrayal of BYU or the church. After all, I figure God would rather you be a good person than just a good member.

And in the meantime, the survival guide has the most complete advice I've found on surviving at BYU during a faith crisis, a situation that requires limited church attendance, or as an ex member. I hope you find it useful.",24,Czarcasm2jjb,3

A bunch of them contracted the delta variant of COVID recently and it hospitalized quite a few of their family members. A husband and cousin were the only ones vaccinated and showed no symptoms at all. Now pretty much all of these people have switched their stance on vaccines and recommend people get them.

Your friend and everyone else affected need to contact BYU's housing office immediately. Even if they aren't students.

I don't appreciate people risking my life so they can get to their destination two minutes faster.",45,lo_profundo,1

y1qgsa,irze3vi,"Jaywalking 900 E is crazy and those people definitely are making the streets more dangerous than it needs to be.

No one in the comments is gonna convince me that the burden of safety falls on the pedestrian on crosswalks that are on campus though. Yeah, it's crazy rude to jaywalk when other vehicles are waiting for you, but if you're going fast enough to where breaking on time is impossible, you ought to be held legally responsible for driving that fast (or often distractedly) in a crowded area. I see way too many distracted and fast drivers on campus roads that make the area so much more dangerous for a non-driver like me",22,None,3
xcmlmu,io77xbb,"I actually met Deidre and discussed this with her so I know what happened. I won’t go into personal details but the decision to remove all of her work from BYU was her decision, not BYU’s. I believe that was around September of last year, although I’m not sure how long after that until the Maxwell Institute had removed everything. So, in her case at least, it’s not BYU choosing to silence certain scholars, but rather those scholars choosing not to publish through BYU.",49,austinchan2,1
xcmlmu,io8ylv3,"I don't know specifically about the people you're asking about, but when I worked for BYU Speeches we frequently had to take stuff down and people got mad at us for it. The reason was almost always coming from the speaker, not BYU. Often they would give us permission to publish their words for only a certain period of time, and then we were legally required to pull it. If an author, speaker, whatever no longer wants their work up on a BYU site, it's just taken down for them.

Occasionally there were other reasons, like if an older speech had some blatantly racist or homophobic remarks it would get pulled, and sometimes republished after changes had been approved by the speaker. Don't know if any of this info helps, but I figured I'd share before you accuse someone of intentionally removing things. There are often a lot of behind the scenes things that people are trying to take care of.",12,ekmckenzie,2
xcmlmu,io65dm5,It may not be as sinister as you think. It looks like the website has had some sort of update as all the posts seem to indicate they were made today. I suspect that a lot of stuff is being transferred over from one server to another.  It may be that they finally adopted the same website content management system as the rest of BYU and so it's taking some time to transfer the old site content over to the new.  I could be wrong maybe the webpage is just wonky like that with posts but every news post saying it was posted today on there makes me thing this is the reasoning.,7,True-Grab8522,3
