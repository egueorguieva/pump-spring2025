Before everything, I used to skate by his little lookout and stop at the stop signs because I was on the road. He noticed and gave me props for that, and words of encouragement from then on.

I stopped by a few times and had a few conversations with him after that. I could tell this guy was a kind soul with a lot of love to share, and hot damn was I right!

Since I graduated literally yesterday and I’ve already moved to a different city and state, I figured I’d take one last cruise around campus, and I ran into this beautiful soul!

Michael and I caught up, he said he was very proud of me and that I’m eventually gonna get married. When that happens, he wants an invite, and he’s the first person on the list!

qx65xu,Has anyone else been solicited for donations by so called “fellow students” inside campus buildings?,859,https://www.reddit.com/r/UTAustin/comments/qx65xu/has_anyone_else_been_solicited_for_donations_by/,82,2021-11-19 02:35:56+00:00,None,"Every now and then I would have someone who obviously doesn’t speak English hand me a card saying they’re a student at UT struggling to survive and need help. 

For one thing, it’s obvious to me that these people are not UT students. It’s ok to not know perfect English but whenever I try speaking back at them, they just give blank stares. How these people could be UT students while not knowing any English is beyond me.

Furthermore, it’s always different people but with the same MO. They all wear the same outfit and look like students. They all look like they’re in their upper 20’s or lower 30’s. Same pamphlet. Same “gifts” (crackers or cookies). 

I’ve also had this happen to me in multiple occasions in different locations. They’ve come to me in different floors of the PCL and even around midnight at the EER. 

Some are even a bit aggressive. Just a few minutes ago one lady of this group solicited me and whenever I had to respectfully say no (I’m hella poor) she left in a huff. On the 4th floor of the PCL mind you.

At this point I’m worried about their safety. It could be that these people are not even aware of what they’re doing and are being exploited by some exterior group.

This is creepy to me. I’ll make sure to provide pictures the next time they approach me.


Edit:
After doing some research using the additional information given to me from the comment below. We were able to track down one of the solicitors to a “news anchor” called Princess Laranas using one of the venmo handles they use for donations. This lead us to their official Facebook profile.

Princess Laranas is a news anchor for this group called SMNI News. SMNI is owned and operated by Swara Sug Media Corporation which is the parent company of Sonshine Media Network International. This company is the broadcasting arm for Filipino televangelist and church leader Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy.

Besides making grand claims such as being the “Appointed Son of God” and being the “Owner of the Universe”, Mr. Quiboloy was also accused of brainwashing a former church member, and was indicted for sex trafficking.

Mr. Quiboloy is the founder of the church “Kingdom of Jesus Christ”. This church practices tithing which has made Mr. Quiboloy very wealthy.

Besides that, the church is also guilty of human trafficking, abuse and are required to meet tithing quotas (which is probably why they’re soliciting us for money)

Check out the article yourself:

tldr; It’s a cult, go figure.",hl7e9ml,"Yes, had this happen to me a few times in the EER Freshman year.

A few weeks ago, I was in the SAC when a girl came up to me and tried to sell me a cheap mask for $10. I tried to decline but she got pushy so I caved in and venmoed her a dollar. It was a bizarre interaction and I watched as she went around the room and did the same routine with everyone else. 

I didn’t think much of it until yesterday, when a man came up to me in the Union with the exact same schtick. 

In hindsight, I’m kind of glad I venmoed that girl. I googled her Venmo handle and she has some personal accounts on other websites with the same username. Maybe I could reach out and see if she’d be willing to tell me what’s going on?

edit: alright, this is weird. Their display name on Venmo is “Princess Laranas.” If you Google that, the first result is an Austin-based “news personality” that works for SMNI USA, a Filipino televangelist network.

During the snowpocalypse, we brought food to him 3 times a day. We delivered food straight into his underground shelter so he didn't have to go out into the cold. 

We heard him meowing in his lair the night after the worst freeze, so we knew he survived the coldest night -- but we hadn't seen any sign of him since then.

All of the other cats emerged in the nice weather, but still no Domino. We were starting to get pretty worried about him...

But he just came out tonight to get a meal delivery from his personal assistant! We are getting misty-eyed <3

Make yourself go, make yourself talk, if you got nothing to say and no one else is talking there is always the great standby question of ""what is your research about?""

I am a graduating senior and about an hour and a half ago finished up my last class. I feel nothing and everything at all. I still remember so much, and have gone through an incredible transformation over the last four years here. I wanted to write down my story briefly for you longhorns; I hope you feel comfortable enough to share something as well. 

I come from a small town in Texas, and about only four of our class came to UT. I roomed for three years with one of my best friends, and came into college in a relationships with my then girlfriend. We broke up mid-way through the first semester and it absolutely crushed me. I spent a lot of time isolating, lamenting and being dejected. I was a pretty bad person and so I felt like it was punishment for me to suffer and not enjoy college. I spent most of my time my first two years just studying. I did not make many friends, and the ones I did make I did not keep up with. I played in a sports club but I only made two good friends (still good friends with both). However, most of my time was miserable - I put on weight, struggled with becoming a better person, felt like I didn't deserve much and just wanted to suffer a lot. It was the only sensation I felt really strongly. I didn't have any friends to confide in and just didn't feel like it was worth it. Although this never hurt my studies - I really enjoyed my classes and felt like my professors were the best people in my life. Additionally, I spent much time reflecting and keeping up a journal (which I still do), and reading books. These two things kept me afloat, and actually made me a better person.  

But I realized that holding grudges against myself was wasting so much energy - I was tired of being so sad on purpose and living a miserable life. I started to eat right, work out in the mornings, took up a part time job on campus, and started saying ""yes"" to life more often. Life didn't change magically change or get amazing - but it did get better. I made a few more friends, got nice internships, expanded my network, stayed healthy, got back into my numerous hobbies, went out more and just...lived life. I never did anything I didn't want to, or felt pressured to do something. I made many great memories, and I am thankful for my pain because it gave me wisdom and through that I grew. I am proud of what my four years meant to me, even though it wasn't the most ideal. All my friends have been supportive in their own capacities, and I have grown close to many professors. Everything isn't fine and dandy, but it is better. 

And now it has all come to an end. I really don't know what will happen with commencement. I really don't think it will go through if I am being honest. I am upset my parents won't get to fulfill their own dream of seeing their son graduate and walk. Or that I won't get to take pictures with my professors and friends at graduation. I plan on writing a letter to every professor, TA, and friend that inspired me and meant something to me. This isn't the end of things though. I will also be back here for my dual Master's program, so I am very thankful I don't have to part ways with Austin and UT yet. This isn't the way I imagined it, but that is okay. I have achieved so much, and I have so much to achieve. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that those who read this also share their story - I would love to read it.",fpszgd3,"I'm just some dude on the internet, but I'm proud of you, and of your school choice.

But my friends and I went to the silent disco tonight at Greg. It was pretty low key, but enough people for it to feel safe and such at night. Plus there’s always some people out on speedway at night anyways. So my friend and I are chilling on the side and this guy comes over to sit with us. Initially he seems chill, kinda interesting, whatever. First red flag was that he didn’t even go to UT. He said he was giving his friend a tour of Austin and stopped by campus. Second red flag was that he was obviously significantly older than us and actually showed excitement (ew) when we said we were freshman/sophomores. Then, when we asked him what he does (since he’s apparently not in school), he literally says “you don’t want to know what I do.” Finally after a really awkward few minutes of him calling us “party girls” and “freshies” he asks if we want to go get smoothies?? We both don’t really answer and I think he FINALLY gets the vibe and says he’s gonna go find his friend (who he said was this dude dancing in front of us.) Well when he gets up he goes no where near his “friend” and actually just walks away to a nearby staircase where he sits down and stares at us. 

THEN a group of girls (who were the best people ever like thank you so much for checking on us) comes up to us and repeats everything he told us because he had tried the same lines/story on them JUST BEFORE US. Asking to get smoothies and everything. Lemme just say that gave me freaking chills. We waited for him to get up and leave before even considering walking back to our dorm. 

Anyways. This is tame compared to some situations, I get that. But I just had to say something because I’d never want to hear that some girl actually took him up on the smoothie offer and something happened. And no, there really wasn’t an option to “report” him or anything  as the whole thing was just students (even though I’m honestly thinking I should’ve done more). But just please be careful. I feel stupid that I even entertained a conversation with this man. The first half seemed fine but if he hadn’t been so outwardly creepy something really could’ve happened. Please stay safe y’all💖",hc59okb,"Unidentifiable man hitting on freshman girls on campus? That is certainly an incident where you would be in the right to call UTPD and let them handle it.

I had a similar experience when I was taking a walk coincidentally before a football game, this middle aged white man who was going to the game with his friend asked me hey, where's the stadium? I gave him directions, tried to leave. He starts introducing himself, asked my name, if i go to college, and wanted to shake my hand. I quickly said my name, shook his hand and wanted to leave AGAIN ASAP. Zoomed away 6 ft from him, he's like HEY, do you wanna get dinner? I was like no, bye.

Meanwhile his friend was standing 10 feet away from him, and then i realized, he fucking knew where the stadium was, his friend seen this shit happen before, and he used ""if i go to college"" as an implicit way to find out if I was of LEGAL age. ffs I immediately went back home and washed my hand like 5 times cuz I was so grossed out.

To summarize my experience here at UT it's been nothing but one pile of bullshit after another. This started the moment I got into college but it's now being exacerbated by online classes. It's like the professors are just spraying a fully automatic UZI with extended mag at students except instead of bullets it's menial assignments. I have actually gotten dumber since I've come to college. Every day I look at the calendar and every day there are more and more assignments due at all hours of the day. All of this for what? A piece of paper so I can work a desk job until I die? I'm tired of ""education"" just being a bunch of nonsense. To accurately define how I feel on a daily basis I have chosen a meme that is most fitting: ""Thomas had never seen such bullshit before."" I know there are others that feel exactly the same way.

Anyways, that concludes my spill.",g8n7gsl,"I went through a period at UT for a few years where all I could think about was how much I hated everyone around me succeeding so effortlessly while I struggled.  UT especially was touted as what was supposed to be the time of our lives, at least by my uncle who graduated in '05, but a lot has changed since then

I hated going to class, I hated waking up every day. I felt an intense visceral loathing for everyone- all the rich kids who went to fancy high schools, etc. (I know that's not everyone, but I was just jealous and bitter).  It was so overwhelming.

 I had some sort of nervous breakdown before midterms every single month due to acute stress, was hospitalized, yada yada. But before the downward spiral into depression and suicide attempts was your line of thinking- the hate. If you are able to, as cliche as it is, I would seek some help.

Stay strong.",170.0,for-the_love-of_cake,g8nc8li,[deleted],70.0,None,g8n90nv,"If it’s not right for you, it’s a very expensive way to be spending your time. Look into potential careers you want and how you might get there without a degree. A lot of times degrees are just a checkbox off of a resume for employers but are not always dealbreakers. Even after graduating you often need to start at the bottom and work your way up anyways. Speaking from experience and dealing with my own issues mentally i spent too long retaking classes and getting q drops before realizing it was not the right time for me to be in school. I spent too long realizing that and it’s better to go into college with a certain level of drive for what you want to get out of it. Cause when it sucks, it sucks! I’m in a different place in my life and hope to go back soon to finish my degree for my own reasons and with a fresh perspective instead of being burnt out as fuck with the education system.

Edit: want to take this time to shout out UHS. It took me entirely too long to seek out help for my depression/mental health. Luckily I had a group of amazing professors that genuinely cared for my mental health and were able to encourage/help me get set up. if you’re reading this and might need it, take advantage of the extensive (and cheap) resources UT has to offer while you can.

We (Cats of West Campus / Campus Cat Coalition) were in touch with vet techs, and they recommended taking him in for antibiotics and possibly stitches.

We tried catching him and trapping him numerous times to take him to the vet, but he is too damn stubborn to be caught. We tried grabbing him, we tried a drop trap, we even tried sardines! 

I had a stakeout one night trying to trap him, and I got UTPD called on me for looking sketchy.

Despite not being able to take him to the vet, we tried to get antibiotic on his wound at least once or twice a day. We were successful on most days, although he did start getting mad at us.

We don't know what happened, probably got in a fight with a tomcat or possibly raccoon. [I took him to the vet 2 years ago](https://www.facebook.com/catsofwestcampus/posts/2150956778291654) so thankfully his rabies vaccine was still up-to-date.
