1erlwhh,NOTE to Incoming Freshman: DON'T study Computer Science,579,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1erlwhh/note_to_incoming_freshman_dont_study_computer/,177,2024-08-13 23:09:54+00:00,Grand_bc_8985,"I'm a rising senior studying CS and Statistics, and I, to a degree, regret studying computer science. Now, contrary to the title of this post, I am not saying that no one should study computer science. Rather, the title is hyperbolizing but emphasizing the fact that you should approach the prospect of studying computer science with some hesitation, especially at Harvard. Studying computer science is not that much of a straightforward choice anymore. However, despite the exaggerated title, I honestly suggest that no one studies *only* computer science, without pairing it with a joint or double concentration in an adjacent field (e.g statistics, mathematics, physics and applied math). This is simply my opinion, which I think is an unpopular one, but I am just giving my perspective.

Reasons for not studying computer science:

1. *Oversaturated Job Market*: The job market is oversaturated, as there have been an influx of computer science degrees over recent years. It used to be that studying computer science at many universities would guarantee a solid job and studying computer science at Harvard would almost guarantee some kind of well-paying, entry-level big tech job. This is not the case anymore, just getting a computer science degree at Harvard isn't enough anymore. On top of taking and studying CS classes, companies are expected students to do personal projects/research or past internships, regardless of what school you go to, for internships and entry-level positions. In addition to that, passing interviews requires a rigorous study and practice of Leetcode-type problems.

The point is that studying computer science is losing relevance in terms of getting a tech job because employers are recognizing more the fact that computer science is not the same as software engineering. In my opinion, employers aren't necessarily prioritizing computer science students that much anymore for SWE/tech jobs over other STEM students (math, physics, and engineering) students. What you learn in most of your CS courses, which tend to be more theoretical, don't matter that much for doing the job. You literally need a basic understanding of coding (i.e. syntax, loops, functions, conditionals) and then some foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms (which you can get from leetcode). Leetcode-style problems aren't even typically relevant when you get to the job, but having a notion of efficiency is important. Even algorithms classes like CS120 and CS124 don't help immensely with leetcode. CS124 can help make **starting** leetcode easier, but you won't be able to solve leetcode problems well just after taking that class. You still need to practice.

Even if computer science classes like CS124 were tremendously helpful, the point is that many students take these kinds of classes, not just computer science students. CS124 is a very popular course among math, physics, and applied majors as well. In fact, the students who usually perform the best in these classes are people with more mature mathematical backgrounds. Employers don't really care if you've taken a breath of computer science courses; they're just looking for basic competencies in programming and interview material. A math major who's has a background in algorithms is essentially equivalent to a CS major who's taken an algo course + a bunch of other CS courses when it comes to competing for tech jobs, especially if both have the adequate amount of outside-the-classroom experiences. Heck, sometimes studying STEM doesn't even matter. There's a decent number of humanities concentrators who end up working as software engineers after graduation.

2. *Intellectual Return and Pedagogy.* I would argue that studying computer science over other STEM fields doesn't provide much of an intellectual and even knowledge benefit. As I mentioned, a lot of the concepts you learn in computer science courses aren't directly relevant to jobs in the industry. The fact is, you are probably going to forget most of the stuff you learned in your computer science classes a few months after you graduate. Heck, it's likely you can barely remember material from courses a month after the semester ends. The most important concepts you learn from college is how to *problem-solve* and how to *learn*.

While I would say that studying computer science does improve problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning skills, other STEM fields seem to be more effective at doing this for pedagogical and natural reasons. Specifically at Harvard, and also at other universities, computer science courses are generally not as well taught as other types of STEM classes. This pedagogical gap happens because material tends to be glossed over in computer science classes, while math and statistics classes focus more on subtleties and foundational concepts. This also seems to be because the computer science department is very research-oriented while other departments, especially statistics, tend to focus more on teaching. Most computer science professors treat teaching as presenting basic concepts needed to understand their research while other professors pay more careful attention to how they introduce a concept to their students.

An important idea is that computer science is literally a **branch of mathematics.** Therefore, many computer science concepts rely on using math skills. If you have a solid math background, which you can develop by studying subjects like math, physics, and engineering, transitioning to computer science is not really that difficult. Someone who studied computer science for years may start out with more knowledge than you, but they might not necessarily be better at solving computer science problems. Domain-specific knowledge isn't critical for solving many problems in computer science, because the knowledge can be picked up relatively quickly if you're comfortable with mathematics. This does not mean that people who study computer science don't also have the skills to comfortably transition to math and engineering, but it is easier to go from math/engineering/physics to computer science than vice versa. Even if you're interested in going into academia for CS, I don't think you get that much advantage from studying it over students studying adjacent-fields.

TLDR: Don't only study computer science. At the minimum, pair it with something else. Opinions are my own, and you're happy to disagree.",lhztklj,"> the computer science department is very research-oriented while other departments, especially statistics, tend to focus more on teaching.

Since you singled out statistics, I hope u/joeblitzstein can reply to that comment.

I have been reading the Harvard Crimsons old coverage of Cambodia, where the crimson openly supports the Khmer Rouge. Now prior to the fall of Nol's Military dictatorship and Americas bombing campaign, supporting the Khmer Rouge is understandable. However, after the Khmer Rouge takes power and begins Yero Zero in 75, the Crimson while still supporting them out a kind of ""socialist solidarity "", the news of atrocities begins to cause some trepidation. (Cambodia and Crimson Politics - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1975/9/1/cambodia-and-crimson-politics-pbobne-day/) 

However by 76, as what is probably the worst genocide since the Holocaust is in full swing, the crimson has not only continued its support for the Khmer Rouge but has moved to open genocide denial. (Red Scare Over Cambodia - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/2/28/red-scare-over-cambodia-pbpbress-poison/).

‚ÄúIn appointing Ms. Gay, the Harvard Corp., the university‚Äôs governing board, seems to have shifted the institution‚Äôs priorities. It revealed those goals in its Dec. 12 statement, noting that Ms. Gay is the right leader ‚Äúto address the very serious societal issues we are facing.‚Äù Harvard‚Äôs mission is no longer simply advancing knowledge, but knowledge ‚Äúthat will help address deep societal issues and promote constructive discourse.‚Äù From such a perspective, academic honesty seems to matter less than having the right progressive values, and the refusal to disclose underlying data is permissible so long as conclusions support a preferred narrative. Harvard is still among the world‚Äôs premier research universities. It still has a great deal to offer, and calls on the right for it to be taxed or regulated at the state level‚Äîby Massachusetts‚Äîare shortsighted. The university nevertheless needs a reset.

I guess Harvard achieved omniscience in 1847",28.0,CaveatBettor,lmxb0c8,"Tier list template: https://tiermaker.com/create/harvard-shields-17469824-2

For consistency, I'm using the shield designs from here: https://www.harvard.edu/about/history/shields. Other designs can be seen here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraldry_of_Harvard_University

My rankings are based solely on aesthetics and not on any symbolism. For anyone interested, the wikipedia page linked above explains the symbolism for most of these shields.

S-tier:

* The adorned Veritas shield is absolutely gorgeous. Nothing else to say.
* HLS is very aesthetically pleasing. The clean curves and crimson color gradient are beautiful and remind me of stained glass windows. The  ü·¥áx ·¥á·¥õ …™·¥ús·¥õ…™·¥õ…™·¥Ä on the white background is imposing and assertive, and it pairs well with the ·¥†·¥á Ä…™·¥õ·¥Äs just above. Truth, law, and justice. Like the adorned shield, I have nothing negative to say about HLS.
* SPH and HBS have similar qualities. They're both clean and instantly recognizable. The color balances both feel a tad heavy on the white but it's not a big deal. The crosses and their respective decorations look great. However, the outlines & border for HBS are much thicker than for any other shield, and I think it's too much. So HBS goes below SPH.

A-tier:

* HDS: I'm a sucker for chevrons and this one has the perfect thickness and placement. The holly sprigs and wood pigeons fill out the space decently, but also make it feel a bit crowded and messy. The pigeons also make the color balance feel a bit too white.
* SEAS doesn't look too great in this image but it's just because of the dark background of the image. When the shield is placed on a lighter background it [looks much better](https://imgur.com/a/AK9hBJ9). The chain stitch is a nice detail. The ragged cross isn't particularly alluring but it does strike a good balance between being too plain and being too noisy.
* College: The chevron on this one is good, but it feels a bit thin. There's some open space to the left & right of the chevron but it's not a big deal. Looks great overall.
* HMS is cool at first glance, but if you look closely, the lion looks kind of weird and deformed. If it were the [lion on the wikipedia page](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Harvard_Medical_School.svg/1657px-Harvard_Medical_School.svg.png) that I linked above, HMS would be S-tier.

B-tier:

* Veritas / FAS: Bread and butter. It's the ubiquitous base design and it's a tad plain, but still good.
* GSAS is fairly plain. The white stripe doesn't add anything to the base Veritas shield, it just makes the shield feel too horizontal.
* Dental: Among the shields that have the ·¥†·¥á Ä…™·¥õ·¥ÄÍú± chief at the top, this one is the most boring. Also the rectangular shape of the castle doesn't fill out the space well.
* HGSE would possibly be in A-tier, but closer inspection reveals that (1) the two black flowers aren't vertically aligned, (2) the steps aren't all the same length, and (3) the steps have a weird diagonal lip at the top left. These all greatly annoy me.

C-tier:

* HES is wider & rounder than the rest of the shields which IMO looks worse. The chevron is too low and too thin, and it's at 42¬∞ angles unlike the 45¬∞ angles of the chevrons for HDS and College, which annoys me. The chief is not distinctly separated enough from the rest of the shield. The lamp and the bushels of wheat are okay though.
* GSD looks awful. It's just way too messy. It's an eyesore.
* HKS is somehow both too noisy *and* too bland. At least GSD *tried* to do something unique, this one is just a bunch of thin stripes and it looks terrible. Also the stripes become way too small at the bottom due to the shape of the shield.
* Radcliffe just looks bad. The two black stripes are not enough decoration for a shield with no other details.

For grays specifically, there's no AC (like all of them), dirty yellowish hard wood floors, singles converted to doubles, and musty/old looking bathrooms with dirty looking showers (weird growth on shower handles).

There's a rat infestation in Canaday, cockroaches in Canaday and weld (actual bathroom tile sized ones), and overall, the dorms are just ugly.

They have perfect grades (some in pretty hard concentations), have ethereal extracurricular contributions while also having a great social life. Looking at Rhodes and Marshall scholars, for example, really makes me wonder how some people manage to accomplish so many things.

For me, personally, I think I've always worked hard throughout college, so I don't really regret anything in terms of my work ethic. I study a challenging concentration (e.g a combo CS, Math, Stat, Physics), have a solid GPA, and landed a solid internship this summer. I do realize there are times when I could have done things more optimally and taken advantage of more opportunities, but some people really make me wonder if there is so much more I can do.

There are some students here, particularly the people who win prestigious fellowships and awards (Hoops, Summa, Phi Beta Kappa, etc.) who really make doing college look ridiculously easy. Like, I seriously wonder if these people are ever challenged at all during their college life.

My question is how do these people achieve these things? I know they work hard and have excellent time-management skills, but it can't just be as simple as that. I'm trying to see what they do to see how I can improve, though I guess there's not much I can do in college since I'm going into my senior year.

When talking to a lot of people that I felt had it all together, most of them came from parents who actually cared about their grades growing up, got them tutors, helped find them opportunities that aided their growth, went to good schools, etc.

I don't say that's as a slight against them, at all. 

It just contrasted me in a way that made me feel inadequate. 

My parents were absent. Never cared about my grades. Never cared about whether I went to college or not. Didn't help me if I was struggling in school.

The districts I attended school up through high school were the poorest in my state. I had overworked teachers who couldn't help.

And when I got to Harvard later on - I felt like the loser just starting to get his crap together amongst peers who had been academic rockstars since age 9.

It's hard to shake that feeling. And I do NOT say this to denigrate or downplay the accomplishments of a lot of students because they DID that work and they earned their reputation, BUT there's a lot of privilege and advantage that having engaged parents, good primary schools, and adults who help foster growth in students prior to college. And for some students - having the wealth to afford to live somewhere with good schools, a job that pays well enough that the parents can have time to help their kid, and being able to afford tutors, etc. - it makes it easier.

‚ÄúIn appointing Ms. Gay, the Harvard Corp., the university‚Äôs governing board, seems to have shifted the institution‚Äôs priorities.

Harvard is still among the world‚Äôs premier research universities. It still has a great deal to offer, and calls on the right for it to be taxed or regulated at the state level‚Äîby Massachusetts‚Äîare shortsighted. The university nevertheless needs a reset. It can‚Äôt continue down the path of political engagement, which undermines its true mission. If the university‚Äôs governing bodies continue to behave as though academic dishonesty isn‚Äôt of great concern, it can only damage our hard-won prestige, cheapen the value of our degrees and erode the standards necessary for academic excellence.‚Äù

The victory is for merit and non discrimination.

In a 6-3 decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts, the court held that the policies violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment.

The Supreme Court¬†on Thursday invalidates¬†race-conscious policies¬†used by Harvard College and the University of North Carolina to diversify their campuses

But Roberts then also seems to warn that what Harvard is barred from doing directly is also barred from being done indirectly.

So we'll see how that last bit from Robert's ruling will actually be enforced.

Given how powerful and resourceful Harvard is, unless they get taken to court repeatedly and lose repeatedly in the future, their admissions can just do away with test scores entirely and weigh essays a lot more to still try and attain the level of racial balancing/diversity they want to attain.

If any of you are on Sidechat, you'll see there is an outrage, but it is absolutely misplaced. People will forget about this decision come the next application cycle.

I'm a first year PhD and I've been really sad lately at how little there is to get involved in as a graduate student. Most of the resources and opportunities that make Harvard a special place are reserved for undergraduates.

Most of the best clubs and orgs are only for undergraduates. Crimson, the entirety of theatre, lampoon, etc..

The amazing residential life system is only for undergrads. The parties in finals clubs are only for undergrads. What are grad students even supposed to do outside of research? Join the badminton club?? 

In my undergrad I did a lot of writing and theatre as an outlet and now I'm basically banned from doing either in any of the most active organizations.

Going to a bar and drinking with friends is sooo boring.. I wanna actually do shit. The mountaineering club has been really nice and let me join. Idk it's just hard to make friends outside your lab group and no one really cares. There are no school wide events for graduate students. No culture of going to the Harvard-Yale game. 

Some people tell me that this is what graduate school is like everywhere. That most of the institutions are primarily focused on making the undergraduate life as best as it can be. Graduate school is like a job they say, you're supposed to just sit around in lab all day. I didn't know this.. I thought I go to a research institution. To a school where they'd care about making sure we had lives outside of research and had outlets to keep our mental health straight.

Honestly I'm really disillusioned by Harvard and I'm close to dropping out. I'm in CS and turned down a job that pays six figures to join Harvard. I feel horrible. If anyone could tell me I'm wrong and help me find ways to pursue my passions (theatre, writing, lampoon, crimson, etc.) or find opportunities for things outside of lab that would be amazing. Thank you guys",huzjybl,"Fellow grad student here. If you‚Äôre serious about wanting a theater organization for grad students message me! I think generally these clubs don‚Äôt exist because grad students don‚Äôt start them.

But yes grad school is a job and generally as such people find outlets off campus.",108.0,billyfuckinharrow,hv004oi,"Hi, I'm sorry to hear you're having a tough time, but I have to be honest with you - for the most part, graduate school IS a job. Your job as a PhD is to become the world's expert on some topic that hasn't been adequately explored by other academic investigators. That is the reason PhD students are there, so if you're doing a PhD it's because it lights your fire and you want to devote many years to it.

That said, it is also important to maintain some balance in life, and if you are finding the clubs and activities are not geared to people like you, there is lots of stuff just in Boston and Cambridge separate from the university for people who want to make friends - it is, after all, one of the nation's premier cities.

Assuming the Crimson's [earlier reporting of the FAS meeting](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/5/21/faculty-vote-allow-suspended-seniors-graduate/) is accurate, only 115 FAS faculty attended the meeting from among the 888 FAS faculty eligible to vote (<13%). The Crimson reported that this was ""an unusually high turnout for proceedings that are usually pro forma."" It can be reasonably assumed that the unusually high attendance was driven by FAS faculty who disagree with the Ad Board's decision with regard to the affected students. The remaining >87% of voting FAS faculty members didn't even bother to attend and it's still unclear exactly how many of the 13% that did attend voted in favor of adding back the 13 disciplined students to the list of degrees recommended for conferral beyond The Crimson's statement that the group voted ""overwhelmingly"" to reinstate. The Corporation rightly did not accept this vote as justifying a reversal of the disciplinary decisions made by the Ad Board.

The more interesting controversy is the behavior of FAS faculty members who don't seem to understand that the behavior of the sanctioned students had a negative impact on the Harvard community and undermined what should be a shared commitment to civil discourse or, at least, an understanding that civil disobedience warrants valid and meaningful disciplinary consequences. They don't acknowledge as MIT's president did in [a recent communication](https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/actions-morning) that unlike past protest movements on campus that ""This situation is fundamentally different. Why? Because this is not one group in conflict with the administration. It is two groups in conflict,¬†*in part through us*, with each other.""

You can also email faculty you‚Äôve taken courses with and offer to work for them on an hourly basis if they have any projects where they can benefit from your skills. Attach your resume, and see what happens.

And just know, if you do decide applying to doctoral programs is a top priority for you, there are Research Associate jobs at a lot of universities that give you professional research experience for 2-3 years before applying.

1clnj1z,Garber's Announcement on the Encampment,106,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1clnj1z/garbers_announcement_on_the_encampment/,100,2024-05-06 16:36:11+00:00,John-Mandeville,"By email this morning:

""Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

Over the last 12 days, the encampment in Harvard Yard has disrupted our educational activities and operations. The right to free speech, including protest and dissent, is vital to the work of the research university. But it is not unlimited. It must be exercised in a time, place, and manner that respects the right of our community members to do their work, pursue their education, and enjoy the opportunities that a residential campus has to offer. The encampment favors the voices of a few over the rights of many who have experienced disruption in how they learn and work at a critical time of the semester. I call on those participating in the encampment to end the occupation of Harvard Yard.

The disruptions from this encampment at the heart of the University have been numerous. Harvard College exams and other important activities and events have had to move elsewhere. Safety concerns over the past two weeks, including those raised as a result of students sleeping outdoors overnight, have required us to sharply limit access to Harvard Yard. Although some community members have said they are undisturbed by these conditions, we continue to hear reports of students whose ability to sleep, study, and move freely about the campus has been disrupted by the actions of the protesters. We are especially troubled by increasing reports that some within, and some supporting, the encampment have intimidated and harassed other members of our community. When Harvard staff have requested to see IDs in order to enforce our policies, supporters of the encampment have at times yelled at them, tried to encircle them, and otherwise interfered with their work. We have also received reports that passers-by have been confronted, surveilled, and followed. Such actions are indefensible and unacceptable.

As first-year students move out and as we begin our extensive preparations for Commencement, this ongoing violation of our policies becomes more consequential. Thousands of family members, friends, and loved ones will soon join us to celebrate the achievements of graduate and undergraduate students who have earned the right to walk in Commencement. This celebration is the culmination of years of hard work and accomplishment. The members of the Class of 2024 deserve to enjoy this milestone uninterrupted and unimpeded. It would be especially painful if students who graduated from high school or college during the pandemic were denied a full graduation ceremony for a second time.

The individuals participating in the activities of the encampment have been informed repeatedly that violations of University and School policies will be subject to disciplinary consequences and that further violations and continued escalation will result in increasingly severe sanctions. Last week, faculties across the University began delivering disciplinary notices to students who continued to participate in unauthorized, disruptive activity in the Yard despite these notices.

I write today with this simple message: The continuation of the encampment presents a significant risk to the educational environment of the University. Those who participate in or perpetuate its continuation will be referred for involuntary leave from their Schools. Among other implications, students placed on involuntary leave may not be able to sit for exams, may not continue to reside in Harvard housing, and must cease to be present on campus until reinstated.

Enforcement of these policies, which are essential to our educational mission, is an obligation we owe to our students and the Harvard community more broadly. It is not, as some have suggested, a rejection of discussion and debate about the urgent issues that concern the University, the nation, and the world. As an academic institution, we do not shy away from hard and important questions. There are many ways for our community to engage constructively in reasoned discussion of complex issues, but initiating these difficult and crucial conversations does not require, or justify, interfering with the educational environment and Harvard‚Äôs academic mission. Our disagreements are most effectively addressed through candid, constructive dialogue, building not on disruption, but on facts and reason.

Sincerely,

From the article, it sounds like those on involuntary leave are now trespassing on campus and the police can remove them on those grounds. Are there other consequences? Since exams are now over and classes don't begin again until September, is the purpose of placing the students on involuntary leave limited to clearing the Yard for Commencement? Can we expect that the impacted students will be reinstated in time to return to campus before the fall term begins? Do involuntary leaves appear on transcripts? 

I could see this as being a very meaningful step in deterring future violations of Harvard's rules against disrupting university operations if the affected students are unable to return to campus in the fall and miss instructional time. On the other hand, if the leaves are lifted before classes resume and not noted on transcripts, the action would be mostly performative.",23.0,MeSortOfUnleashed

I get along easily with people and I really wanted to have a large group of friends who I can just socialize with and hang out with. I did recruitment for several RSOs, and I was so excited thinking now I could have a bunch of people to spend time with, go out with, be friends with.

I was so happy thinking about having a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù on campus. I have plenty of friends at Harvard, but I really wanted a solid friend group who I could hang out with all the time, go out to eat with, and get super close to. Not just sporadically see or study with.

I got rejected from every single RSO I did recruitment for. I don‚Äôt know why. I thought we had great conversations, I thought I vibed with the people. I thought I was going to have friends. This hurts so much worse because it‚Äôs not a rejection based on academics or skills. The criteria for joining an RSO is that you‚Äôre the type of person they want to be friends with.
It‚Äôs a rejection of me as a person. The members for multiple organizations each got together, multiple times, and sat down and agreed I‚Äôm not someone they‚Äôd ever want to spend time with or be around. 

I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me that none of them at all would have me as a friend. Wondering what I did wrong. Was I not fun enough, not social enough, not friendly enough? I thought our conversations were great. 

I feel like now I‚Äôve missed my chance. I‚Äôll never have a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù like that now. I could try again next year. But I won‚Äôt be a first-year anymore, and why would people who don‚Äôt like me now like me then. I don‚Äôt know what I should‚Äôve done differently.

Every semester, I prepare myself and try to do well, however, I just end up doing horrible. I think that I tried my best during the semester, and then failed the finals, came back home to reflect, and ultimately realized I didn't do enough. It was my fault for not putting in more work, attending more office hours, consistently reading through lecture notes, asking more questions, etc. I just don't know what to do anymore at this institution.

More context: Of course, the consensus of rational Mexicans is that these words are absolute nonsense, however, in this period, unfortunately, many irrational people are sharing this kind of speech by the president.

These speeches are a way of indoctrinating the exaltation of patriotism/nationalism, where the rhetoric is that foreigners are ""evil by nature"" and thay ""they prevent us from developing because they only want to take advantage of us"", in addition to demeaning the education, in a country like Mexico where half of its population only completes the first half of secondary education, this kind of speech in general mobilizes the masses who are looking for an imaginary enemy, generates feelings on ignorant people and unfortunately increases the popularity of the president.

They've been invreasing tuition during the pandemic even though the classes were remote, and now they're increasing them again? Why?

Edit 2: I have been asked what specific tuition increase I'm referring to, here it is. In May 2021 I paid $1880 for a 4 credit HSS class. This year, that same class costs $3,500 ($2,120 if you are accepted into an ALB program). This means, The HSS tuition has increased 86% for non-enrolled students and 12% for enrolled students. A CNBC [study](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/college-tuition-is-now-rising-at-a-rate-lower-than-inflation.html) from October 2021 notes on average tuition and fees in US universities increased by 1.3%, making the Harvard increase excessive. Another [note](https://finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation/) from [Finaid.org](https://Finaid.org) shows that tuition rates generally increase about 8% a year, which again makes the HSS increase excessive.

Edit: I have no idea why every single one of my responses are being downvoted. Listen, at HES, we're not the kids of hedge-fund managers, and some of us want to get a degree. But increasing tuition by 75% means we have to start over at another institution because it is no longer affordable.

For 2022, you also have a $200 health insurance charge that you either need to waive or pay.  You were not charged that in 2021 since HSS was virtual and did not require health insurance.

The author, who was a writer for the Crimson, maturely entitled their piece: ""From a Suspended Senior: With a Raised Middle Finger and Love in My Heart"" claimed the following:

>I grew up trans in rural Maine, **working in kitchens and painting houses**. I‚Äôve come face to face with the law, **moved away from home** at 16. Where I‚Äôm from, going to college is not a given and leaving the state is uncommon.

>But in the spring of 2020, **living out of a garage loft without running water**, I became one of the first openly trans valedictorians in the country and the first person from my high school to get into Harvard.

What they left out is the widespread news coverage that appears to make clear that this is a warped version of the truth.  For example:

[https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian](https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian)

>The very first decision he made was to move out of his family‚Äôs house **and into their garage**, where he could live more independently. Since then, he has worked a number of minimum-wage jobs to support himself, buying his own food, clothes and other necessities. **His parents didn‚Äôt ask him to move out** **or pay his own way**, but it was something that the teen needed to do for himself.  
. . . 

>The teen‚Äôs fierce independence is part of his personality, according to his dad, **Belfast Mayor** Eric Sanders.

I was in the Science Center on Wednesday, and I was having a pretty difficult day dealing with an upsetting situation. I was crying, a lot, sitting on one of the chairs/benches in the Science Center near the side exit toward the Kennedy School. I was on the phone with a friend, venting, and still crying. It was pretty clear that I was very upset and going through something difficult. 

Someone - a young guy who I assume was an undergrad - was walking by, saw me crying, came up to me and gave me a kind look trying to show empathy. He might have been wearing something blue, though it's hard to remember now. He might have mouthed something to try to console me without interfering with my call, or briefly asked me if I was OK. Then he stretched out his hand to me so that I could put my hand in his. I did. After that, I might have said to him that I'm OK, and maybe (hopefully) said thanks. 

To that guy: thank you for showing me compassion and empathy. Thank you for caring. Thank you for offering your hand to me. Your intuition was correct - I really needed human contact and support in that moment. I needed someone's hand. You were right to approach me and try to make sure that I was OK. What you did for me was not a small thing. It mattered a lot.

2) Check out beer and dogs on Fridays at the GSD.  Everyone there is drowning too, but the gene pool is totally different from HLS.

I'm a current sophomore here and to sum everything up, I am absolutely miserable at this school. When I first got into Harvard, I was so blinded by prestige that I just committed on a whim despite being fortunate enough to have many other good options to choose from. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day.

I'm not doing great academically; I came in pre-law but that has changed several times and I don't even know what I want to do anymore. I have other issues, but the worst part of it all is that I have literally no friends and feel like I don't belong anywhere here. Believe me, I have tried SO hard; up until this point, I would spend so many hours every week finding people to get meals with, joining tons of clubs, doing IM sports, quite literally everything people suggest doing to meet new people. But I never end up with any lasting friends no matter how hard I try to keep in touch, and many people have simply just flaked on me or abandoned me when we actually do make plans. I had really hoped it would get better sophomore year, but so far it's only been getting worse. I have nobody to talk to, nobody to hang out with, and every single day feels like the same thing on loop. Every night I just sit alone in my dorm either crying or feeling numb. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past, but with things being so bad this year especially, it's worse than ever and I frequently find myself seriously thinking about ending things because what difference would it even make?

I have had great friends in high school and other places; it just feels like Harvard is the one place I don't click with anyone no matter how much I put myself out there, and the overall fake and toxic culture here doesn't help. I came to college hoping and even expecting that I would make at least a few great friends and have a fun college experience, but it's only making me so, so depressed and alone. I just want to be able to go out with friends once in a while, have someone to eat meals in the dining hall with. Is that really too much to ask?

I'm really on the fence about just sticking it out for 2 more years or seriously considering transferring somewhere else. I feel like the logical decision from a career/future perspective would be to just stick it out because firstly, I don't think it will look great on my resume/job applications, especially transferring from a school as renowned as Harvard. Also, if I transfer as a junior, I anticipate that it will be very difficult to integrate with the new school and make friends at this point. I'm so miserable at Harvard, but I'm worried to let go in case my efforts to transfer won't end up being worth it.

Could I please get some advice? I'm so desperate and sad and I really need some honest thoughts from people. Thanks.",lydtacb,Hey I‚Äôm also a sophomore.

I am an international grad student here. Have you contacted CAMHS? Personally, the combination of CAMHS and getting help from admin have really helped with my own struggles and history of mental health issues. 

I think you can get to a point in your depression where you can‚Äôt enjoy things anymore - which makes it inherently so difficult to then connect with people. In my personal experience, getting better mentally has cleared up space to see others as full people and potential friends.

Also, I endorse the ‚Äúfind international students‚Äù. They‚Äôre all in a strange place, and for most the competitive culture sits also quite uneasy.

Arboretum (stuff should be flowering in the spring, good time to go)

A day trip to the Cape (if you like beaches) or up to Maine for good lobster (if you can, buy live and steam/cook yourself)

Symphony Hall (and hey, fun fact, it was designed with consultation from a Harvard physics prof for acoustics)

Copley/main branch of BPL

(if you're into it) sports stuff at Fenway/TD Garden

(if you happen to be leaving after the summer season starts) the BSO at Tanglewood

Find someone to get you into the secret room in the Harvard Art Museum, or the taxidermied bird archives (which I think are in the comp zoology museum basement but it's been a while so don't quote me on that)

Bonus, things that are technically attractions but tbh aren't that interesting: Faneuil Hall, Freedom Trail, Harbor Islands, Duckboats, Museum of Science

p4bzma,A summary of the discord drama and how it relates to the subreddit,71,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p4bzma/a_summary_of_the_discord_drama_and_how_it_relates/,19,2021-08-14 17:12:43+00:00,toadbro,"Recently, the discord that is associated with this subreddit has gone through some major changes. In short, the members of the discord have completely migrated over to a new discord with the previous mods as the owners.

Why did the members decide to change discords? As another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p3c2y9/wrong_discord_on_subreddit_sidebar/) mentions, this was due to issues with the ownership. The specific issues were summarized in that thread, but the thread was locked before other members could elaborate on the details. The owner was never present, took credit for the work the two main admins did, and refused to transfer ownership even after a vote among the moderators on discord. This server was massive, highly active, and a crucial social hub especially during the pandemic, but almost nobody knew who the owner was. In fact, the owner had as little as 13 messages in the server over several years. This all got intense over the last couple of months as the owner ghosted all of the members, including the admins.

Now, this all just seems like isolated discord drama. This directly relates to the subreddit as the owner and one other admin are the major moderators of this subreddit. Even though the new [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/harvard) is the only active one of the two, the owner of the other discord server changed the link on the subreddit to redirect to their server rather than the active one.

All of these problems are a result of the moderation teams on both the previous discord and the current subreddit. The top moderators are not Harvard affiliated anymore and have been the main power holders for an extended period of time. We would not be opposed to the idea of alumni as moderators, but these particular moderators have shown no interest in being a part of the communities they are moderating and should pass off their roles to active members of the communities.

Perhaps instead of locking threads with questions and ghosting us more, you can take some time and answer them directly. Also, there is still a link to the discord on the subreddit. You should probably remove that if you are totally trying to disconnect from the discords.",h8xjuvb,I agree with the tone of this post.

From the very start, I recall feeling unmotivated and struggling with even the easy stuff. I tried constantly, but never succeeded, in figuring out what is going on mental health wise. I really tried.

Without getting too specific, I regret how I spent my time at Harvard. I got into a particular club and thought it was a golden ticket to a particular path. It was a very Quixote-like because it was‚Ä¶not what I expected, and actually so, so much worse. It chewed me up and spit me out. I kept spending my time there thinking things would get better, but it was sunk cost fallacy thinking. I wish every day I put time into other activities.

I am consumed by regret and self-blame. I wake up in a panic over it. When I think of the ‚Äúgood times,‚Äù or the covid era when things were relatively calm and easy, before I joined the club, I feel legitimate fear. Does anyone have fear around nostalgia? I‚Äôll remember something somewhat pleasant and feel absolute dread.  Like, why couldn‚Äôt I lock in at that moment? Why didn‚Äôt I do differently? Why didn‚Äôt I keep talking to that person I used to talk to? The gist of the thoughts is generally, ‚ÄúI was so safe then.‚Äù Maybe it‚Äôs because the rut I‚Äôm in has been causing some serious tension at home. It feels really scary.

Are there any alumni hanging around here who had a rough time at Harvard, and even the first few years out of school, but got back on their feet? I could really use some hope right now.

You are where you are now - you can still do whatever the fuck you want with your life. I mean that sincerely. You can go back to gradschool for anything. I knew someone who decided to become a doctor their senior year after concentrating in humanities. She took two years of science classes at another college and got into med school. 

I think its pretty healthy to say, wow if I knew what I know now, I would've done things differently. It means you're getting smarter. 

Look at people in their 30s+ who are living lives you want to live and figure out how they got there. Then do those things. You also need to decide what the probability of success is for you in that path (for example being a doctor vs being an Olympic gymnast)

To the rest of the world, you're a Harvard grad. No one except you really gives a shit how you spent your time there. 

For me personally- Harvard was a low point, I took a very circuitous path, ended up in a place I never imagined, and met my wife. Life is still challenging, but in a good way.

So I had 10 good friends still in school and half of us lived off campus. We bundled up watching TV to figure out what was going on like most people. It wasn‚Äôt obvious at first but many friends were starting Wall Street jobs that month, but we were still at school. I remember walking across campus with everyone in a daze to drop off some paperwork. 

We had shopping period then, so the next week was very odd. All interesting professors had to have an instant POV on the news and if their course would change. I took an economics of the middle east class. Usually it had 12 people in it - 50 showed up and the prof said the course was not going to change. My terrorism class went from 50 people to 250. 

The other change was how militaristic the country and the campus became. I know folks that went to the military after that. In my building there was a HBS guy that was called back to the service. And debates about going to war with Afghanistan and Iraq increased throughout the semester.

My memory is that eventually classes were cancelled, but nobody had gone anyway.  We were all glued to any TV we could find in our dorms.  The Internet was a thing, but social media was not.  So TV and news websites (cnn.com, nytimes.com, thecrimson.com etc.) were the main sources of information.

In the morning, the news came very fast, with first one, then the second plane hitting the towers (we all were watching live as the second plane hit), and then the attack on the Pentagon, and then the last plane going down in PA on the way to DC.    


There was a lot we didn‚Äôt know.  We had more comprehensive, and horrific, views of the attacks on the WTC than we did of the Pentagon and the site in PA.  We knew that the FAA was grounding all traffic, but reports kept coming in of planes in the air anyway.  The president and vice president were in undisclosed locations, and didn‚Äôt communicate until later in the day.  We learned that the attackers had taken off at Logan airport.  We worried about additional attacks, including, to some extent, on Harvard itself.  There wasn‚Äôt much we could do except worry.

Some students and faculty had friends and relatives in New York and DC.  And as the day went on most people had quiet phone calls with family and friends, wherever they were, to connect and confirm.

I‚Äôm not here to talk about AA, so if you‚Äôre coming to debate, please pick another post.

But since AA has been stricken down I‚Äôve been noticing a ton of subtle anti-blackness. This, as well as my awareness of how AA likely contributed to my admission as I‚Äôm black and native American, has been making me feel like I don‚Äôt deserve to be here, that I stole some other person‚Äôs spot. I got great grades and a high SAT and had good ECs that I would say are typical of a t20 student but doesn‚Äôt necessarily scream ‚ÄúHARVARD‚Äù, but still, I wasn‚Äôt an absolute sweat in high school like some of you folks, and when I hear these stories about how these 1600 SAT 4.0 GPA kids who did research at MIT in the 9th grade got rejected, I can‚Äôt help but feel like it‚Äôs my fault somehow? I also feel as if they believe it‚Äôs my fault as well, that they hold some grudge against me.

This isn‚Äôt me trying to garner sympathy, truly, but this has been killing my mood recently. Anybody else feel this way?",lwv22ty,"Standard but good advice:

* Nobody ""deserves"" to get into Harvard. The admissions office could fill classes with people with 1600 SATs **or** published science papers **or** national sports titles **or** incredible adversity stories. Anyone who got in got lucky and could have been replaced by someone equally good on paper, we all have to accept that and make the most of our luck.
* There's no objective ranking of applicant merit. Harvard is trying to assemble a class that will go off and do great things and make Harvard look good (and donate lots of money). This is 100% a guessing game, and they hedge their bets with people who look promising in all kinds of ways, from winning international math competitions, to overcoming K-12 antiblackness to get great grades, to having rich parents. You're here because of what Harvard thinks you might become, not who you were in high school.
* Race-based AA, whatever forms it has taken and/or may still take, is frankly one of the most justifiable routine deviations from a pure numbers-based ""merit"" approach. Being black and/or native American is still a real obstacle for a US kid on average, and it's rational to factor that in when assessing on-paper accomplishments. Meanwhile, a high proportion of your classmates got a boost from legacy status, going to a name-brand prep school, being good at a rich-person sport, etc. You're just under more of a daily spotlight.

tl;dr: if you want to ""deserve"" your spot here, stop worrying about how you got it. Just focus on what you're here to do and ignore the haters in your head.",48.0,vegatwyss,lwvfl0r,"Black Alum here from ‚Äò09.

AA was a good thing. It sucks that we had to make a policy to insist that organizations stop passing over qualified applicants because of their race. And it sucks even more than the Supreme Court didn't defend it. 

Now that trump has been elected, things are going to much worse for minorities, because they don't deserve to be here as much as white people do?It's 2024 and we're still privileging whiteness. Fuck everything about that (I'm white btw). White people have been keeping others out of the circle ever since this country started. You have every right and more to be at Harvard.

What are some of your recommendations on how to make the most out of being at the college?",lol8mrk,"* Make a list of 1-5 things you legitimately might want to do in a future (PhD in X, join company Y, etc.) and work backwards from there to prioritize what really matters (from a career/post-grad POV).  Lots of stuff becomes unimportant when you realize it is truly disconnected from anything at the top of your list.

* Periodically redo the above exercise--your top 5 or understanding of what matters may change.

* Interview current students ahead of you, recent grads, and/or older alumni about their paths.  Use that to again check your prioritization list.

If the above sounds like a bunch of work...it isn't supposed to!  It is supposed to do the opposite--help you deal with rampant FOMO, because there are a bazillion possible time sucks, including for things that you think you *might* want (""well what if I *did* want to join McKinsey?"") but truly don't.

* Clubs really don't matter that much, except 1) for very specific paths and 2) insofar as they are directly teaching you critical things.  Don't stress too much, and don't spend more time on them than you actually can rationalize.

* Your specific coursework similarly doesn't matter for most pursuits.  This doesn't mean that learning doesn't matter, but rather than class X versus Y likely won't matter in 5 years, so don't stress if you can't fit in a specific course or second concentration or whatnot.  Exceptions to all of this, of course, for very specific paths like PhD in STEM fields.

* Along those lines, figure out how much your GPA matters.  

This might sound a little odd, but going back to the ""top 5"" list--

There are a lot of paths where your GPA really doesn't matter (as long as it isn't awful).  But also a few where it really does (certain graduate programs, as limited # of high-end career options, etc.).  

If you're gunning for a path where that ~4.0 really does make a difference...have at it.

If you're not (and be honest with yourself), 1) relax a little and 2) put your energies elsewhere.

Know/learn what you need to do.

* Summer internships are great, both from a career POV (crucial for resume) and for getting you outside of the Harvard bubble.  Understand how the application processes work, and treat it like a priority activity.  Success (first internship) begets success (more options for second) here.

(This doesn't mean that if you don't get your dream internship you're hosed!  Just each step is marginally easier, if you're thoughtful in building a path forward.)

* Go into Boston occasionally.  Even if just to walk around with friends.

* Exercise. Lift weights.  Maybe start a martial art like BJJ.

* Lastly, run the same ""top 5"" exercise for things that you actually enjoy and/or help you recover.  Give bonus points for things which get you mixing with your classmates.",71.0,farmingvillein,lonzkem,"Make good friends.  Harvard alums are good to know.  They seem normal now but many of them will go on to do great things.  Like Conan O‚ÄôBrien, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, Tom Morelli, Yo Yo Ma‚Ä¶",18.0,dave3948,lonzmzr,"I‚Äôm going to approach this completely differently than the other comment here, just to give another perspective (though their advice is actually also great). While many strategies focus on building a long-term career through goal setting and prioritization, I think there‚Äôs a more holistic approach to enjoying college life without feeling like you‚Äôre sacrificing your future.

1. Focus on Exploration, Not Just Optimization
College is one of the few times in life when you‚Äôre surrounded by a huge variety of people, ideas, and activities. By stepping outside of a hyper-focused path, you might stumble upon something you‚Äôre passionate about, even if it doesn‚Äôt align with pre-set goals. A flexible, exploratory mindset may still lead to career success, but it also creates room for serendipity. (I stumbled into my current career path because of this)

2. Enjoy the People and Build Relationships, Not Just Networks
Networking is important, but don‚Äôt approach every relationship with a career-oriented lens. Instead, enjoy genuine connections with people because those are the relationships that often end up shaping your life. Career networks are fine, but the friends who stick by you through the highs and lows will be just as‚Äîif not more‚Äîimportant.

3. Balance Achievement with Personal Fulfillment
I‚Äôd say focus on doing things that make me happy and fulfilled‚Äîwhether that‚Äôs joining a fun club, pursuing a hobby, or taking classes purely for interest. Sure, academics and career goals matter, but finding activities that give you joy and balance out the stress is what makes college a memorable experience.

4. Use Mistakes as Learning Opportunities, Not Career Setbacks
Many stress over GPA, internships, and getting everything ‚Äúright.‚Äù But I think it‚Äôs more productive to embrace mistakes as learning experiences rather than career-destroying failures. It‚Äôs in those moments where you find personal growth, and that can build resilience for your future career. Nobody cares if your (massively inflated) GPA has a handful of non-A‚Äôs on it. But being able to speak candidly about your growth in your ability to handle increasingly complex material, your past failures and subsequent growths will pay dividends in your life. 

5. Career Can Wait; Experiences Can‚Äôt
A job or a career path can be pursued at any point in life. But this moment, surrounded by a unique environment with access to resources, people, and freedom to explore? That‚Äôs limited to now. If you can, try to travel, attend events, and engage with people beyond just my field of study because those are experiences you can‚Äôt replicate later. 

6. Physical and Mental Health Over Resume Building
Exercise, sleep, and mental well-being should come first. Burning out in the name of career preparation isn‚Äôt going to pay off in the long run. Building a healthier lifestyle now will benefit your future success far more than a perfect resume will.

In short, my approach is to prioritize personal growth, meaningful connections, and life experiences over a rigid focus on career optimization. That way, I‚Äôll leave college with not just a diploma, but a set of rich memories and a fuller understanding of myself and the world around me.",18.0,AestheticChimp

1eifoa2,Garber to serve as president until new search '26-'27.,67,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/1eifoa2/garber_to_serve_as_president_until_new_search_2627/,23,2024-08-02 17:16:49+00:00,Inside128,"""Following a meeting of the governing boards earlier today, my colleagues and I are very pleased to let you know that Alan Garber, our interim president since January, will serve as president of the University through the end of the 2026-27 academic year. We plan to launch a full-scale search for his eventual successor in the late spring or summer of 2026.

After serving with distinction as Harvard‚Äôs provost for more than twelve years, Alan has done an outstanding job leading Harvard through extraordinary challenges since taking on his interim presidential duties seven months ago. We have asked him to hold the title of president, not just interim president, both to recognize his distinguished service to the University and to underscore our belief that this is a time not merely for steady stewardship but for active, engaged leadership.

Over the last seven months, and for years before that, Alan has led with a deep concern for all members of the Harvard community, a strong devotion to enduring university ideals, and a paramount commitment to academic excellence. At an especially demanding moment for higher education, Harvard is very fortunate to benefit from his intellectual acumen and breadth of interests, his integrity and fair-mindedness, his equanimity and empathy, his decades-long devotion to the University, his extensive knowledge of its people and parts, and his ardent belief in the power of higher education and research‚Äîand their potential to improve the lives of people and communities near and far. His time in Mass Hall has demonstrated his clear-eyed determination both to help the University chart a course through troubled waters and to affirm the primacy of the teaching, learning, and research at Harvard‚Äôs heart.

In conversations with many people across our community and beyond during the past weeks and months‚Äîincluding especially helpful recent consultations with each of the deans as well as an array of faculty and alumni leaders from the various schools‚Äîwe have consistently heard praise for Alan‚Äôs qualities and how his leadership meets the current moment. People have highlighted his thoughtful and balanced judgment, his openness to different points of view, his even temperament in turbulent times, his concern for student well-being, his commitment to academic freedom and constructive dialogue, his recognition of diversity and inclusion as integral elements of academic excellence, his appetite for innovation, and his constant focus on the best interests of Harvard as a whole. Our recent consultations have strongly underscored the high regard in which Alan is held by a broad range of people who have watched him work and come to appreciate his strengths.

Alan is not only an admired academic leader but also a scholar and educator of exceptional reach. After graduating from Harvard College¬†*summa cum laude,*¬†he earned a PhD in Economics from Harvard and an MD with research honors from Stanford University. A member of the Stanford faculty for 25 years, he became a professor of medicine, economics, and health policy, and was founding director of Stanford‚Äôs Center for Health Policy and its Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, while also practicing as a physician in Palo Alto. Since returning to Harvard in 2011 to serve as provost, he has held faculty appointments in Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and the Economics Department in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As the longest-serving provost in Harvard‚Äôs history, responsible for overseeing academic activities throughout the institution and working to foster new connections across the schools, he gained singular insight into the full span of opportunities and challenges facing the University.

As noted, Alan will carry forward as president through the 2026-27 academic year and we will launch a full and wide-ranging search for his successor in the late spring or summer of 2026. We believe this plan will give Alan and his leadership team the opportunity to sustain and build momentum on a range of priorities and initiatives. It will also provide an ample interval for those of us on the Corporation to reflect, in consultation with others, on how best to approach the future presidential search, including how to ensure robust input from across Harvard and beyond.

As we all know, these remain challenging times. We have experienced significant divisions and pointed questions. We have hard work still ahead to reaffirm our core academic values and our collective focus on learning and scholarship. We must continue working to restore bonds of trust, to bridge divides, to combat forms of invidious hate and bias, and to foster a secure campus climate conducive to dialogue across differences. No less, we have more work ahead to amplify higher education‚Äôs contributions to the wider world and to shine light on why they matter.

Alan‚Äôs talents and experience position him well to guide us in this vital work. Along with my colleagues on the governing boards, I hope you will offer him your concerted support, and I thank all of you‚Äîfaculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends‚Äîfor all you do for Harvard.

But I just think it‚Äôs wrong when one of my classes has a policy that only a certain percentage of the class can get an A, so a 96 was the cutoff for an A (which I BARELY made).

I had my first research experience last semester and flopped on my research project. I basically got no work done and embarrassed myself in front of the professor that was advising me. This happened for two reasons: (1) I didn't manage time to work on the project properly and procrastinated on it, and (2) I wasn't that interested in the project to begin with. While I fully accept the responsibility for this failure and understand how I wasted the professor's time, I am a bit traumatized by this experience. The professor essentially told me and treated me like I was dumb and seemed apathetic from the start of the project when I asked for resources and feedback (it wasn't the professor's fault at all, but I'm saying what happened). I guess I'm a bit ashamed, as I left a bad impression on the professor, and I'm walking around a department where a professor thinks I'm incompetent and unintelligent.

I'm a good student and have excellent time management skills, in terms of managing heavy course loads at the very least. I also recognize that I failed because I was unaccustomed with the open-ended nature of research, and my lack of interest didn't help with that. I only did the research because I was looking for something to put on my resume rather than choosing something I genuinely wanted to explore and learn more about.

I think it is actually a good thing that this amounted to failure. First, I know that I need to be more organized next time to adequately allocate time to a long research project, and I know what things I can do to be make sure I'm spending the appropriate time and putting adequate effort. When I have to do my thesis, I now know that I can't procrastinate, and I need to properly structure my schedule to work on the project, so I can achieve the better results possible. Second, I now understand that it's important to choose research that you're interested in, so you're actually motivated to work on a project (this essentially applies to any work that I do) and don't just do things to put on your resume.

I know how to logically recover from this experience, but how do I mentally recover? I feel really embarrassed...",kio831n,"It looks like you have learned a lot about yourself during this process.

Don‚Äôt worry too much about one professor. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely he gossiped about you to other faculty, but it wouldn‚Äôt matter anyway. The university is huge. Focus on cultivating relationships with the professors you did impress or want to know better. You only need 2-4 references for a job/grad school and they don‚Äôt all have to be professors.

I feel like I burned a lot of bridges during my time at Harvard and it still haunts me. It sucks, but I can‚Äôt go back and at least I did get a couple of professors on my team.

You got this.",25.0,PhantomJellyFish,kioah8s,"My two cents: on the one hand this is a great learning experience and failure is part of the process and part of life.

It‚Äôs hard to see but this is a good thing.  

On the other hand‚Ä¶ get some closure. I‚Äôd make an appointment and sit down with the professor and talk it out. Mend the bridge, thank him or her, apologize if need be. Admit your faults, show your appreciation for their part. You aren‚Äôt the only one who has been there and this shows true courage, accountability and willingness to improve in the future which is commendable.

I'm excited for Harvard and all of the opportunities that will be available to me, but (probably like most everyone else) I'm quite a bit apprehensive about Harvard's social and academic environment. I'm coming from a fairly competitive public high school where I've befriended many intellectually curious people, but I've never experienced an environment where tons of people are top-notch in some way. 

I don't have any illusions of being a top student at Harvard. I view myself as being generally competent, well-rounded, and quicker in some subjects than others--and I'll work hard while I'm here--but I'm certainly no genius or creative savant. For those of you who were/are undergrad at Harvard, how did you navigate becoming an average student after being top of your class in high school? How did you overcome your impostor syndrome/jealousy to reap the intellectual and social benefits of being surrounded by so many unique and qualified people? Any general advice?

Thanks for taking the time!

Regardless I'm doing just fine here. I dont really feel out of place because what I lack in immediate intelligence I make up for in hard work.

Don't worry about how you stack up against other students, focus on yourself and learning as much as you can for *your* sake. You don't need to be a top student here to succeed.

I feel like I should use a throwaway for this (I'm pretty identifiable) but that's okay. 

I'm a first year student (college). I'm also international and have a disability - I'm blind - which doesn't help with all of this. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't find my place here. Last semester I joined some extracurricular activities, The Crimson and a Model UN  type org (although it's not Model UN), but other than adding something to my resume, I don't feel like I have any real friends from them . . I've tried talking to random people at Annenberg and I actually have people I could call my friends, but more than friends they are just people I hang out with and that's it. I feel like the relationships don't go any further. 

I also feel like I'm not taking advantage of everything Harvard has to offer- my flights were canceled so I got here late and when I did I caught Covid two days later, so I haven't been able to get involved in my extracurriculars this semester by attending meetings and such, and I feel like everyone else is doing so much more than me, or that I'm missing out on participating in clubs where I could actually meet nice, down-to-earth people (I'm not saying the ones I'm in the people aren't nice, but I feel like everything is so superficial and competitive...). 

I don't even know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe advice or just knowing that I'm not the only one this is happening to, but it's all pretty overwhelming and I can't help but wonder if I really did the right thing by coming here. Back home I have real friends and family who miss me a lot, and here I have... well, Harvard, opportunities and so on, but I'm not as happy as I'd like to be and I really feel like I should do something to change that.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

I‚Äôm new to Harvard

Hello! 

I‚Äôm taking the plunge and have accepted admittance to grad school this fall. Besides all the worry of financial stuff, I‚Äôm pretty excited for this awesome opportunity! 

Questions:
1. I‚Äôm from the southwest with mild winters, how are winters in MA? 

Well, my area in the southwest received a lot more snow than Cambridge! Haha I was actually excited to experience a huge snowfall out here but nothing! I went home for most of December and January so I‚Äôm not sure if I missed the coldest days, but I managed. Bought a thick jacket, gloves and headwear so the cold was manageable. I did, however, feel like I was getting more and more weary of the cold, wet, windy, and cloudy days as winter wore on. I think I may have gotten a little depressed, because at times I didn‚Äôt want to do anything other than stay at my apartment and sleep. Missed the sun and dry air! 

2. I‚Äôm thinking of driving, epic road trip! I want to have a car there so I can explore New England. Pros/cons? Like will I need to register with MA? 

So, I didn‚Äôt bring my car in July, but I did drive back in January! So, it was ok to not have a car, I got a term Charlie pass and they helped a lot going around mostly between Harvard and MIT. If I wanted to go further, like Walmart (can‚Äôt help it) I used the zip cars located outside my building or nearby. 

After a while, I felt very constricted to where I wanted to go ‚Äî first by how long it took to get to places using the public transportation, secondly by how zip cars were not always available and it was getting expensive (and time restrictions on the cars). 

Bringing my car helped me feel like I had the freedom to go places. Parking ‚Äî my building has a garage ‚Äî so my car was nearby in a protected space (from weather too) but it was 2k for the semester. I got towed twice in Cambridge and got like 2 tickets. I got an ez-pass for tolls. I didn‚Äôt have to get MA plates either. 

Freedom! I went to New Hampshire (scary), providence, and lots of other places. I generally love to drive‚Ä¶ back home we drive a lot. But winter months it‚Äôs pretty bleak around here haha

Traffic‚Äî first month was intimidating but after that, just being a courteous and respectful driver helps. Traffic isn‚Äôt all that bad, I‚Äôve driven in LA, Japan and been in crazy traffic in Delhi!

3. School culture - what can I expect? I‚Äôm really laid back, and love to meet people‚Äî are people friendly? 

Best part of my school was my classmates and my professors. Everyone was so welcoming and supportive. So this ended being an awesome place for me. 

4. On campus or off campus housing? Was looking at the HU site for apartments, they are expensive. I also don‚Äôt want roommates or to stay in a dorm - I‚Äôm an older student who has had my share of that! 

I did not have a place to stay literally until about two weeks before I came out here. My window for the HUH lottery was the end of May and so nothing was available! There was an early window open in April, but I believe you had to sign a lease that started almost immediately and pay upfront. 

I‚Äôm lucky in certain ways, not the hitting the lotto lucky but luck with conditions‚Äî about two weeks before coming out, I checked the HUH website and there were two units available. One quickly disappeared and so I just selected the one that was left. 

It was a furnished studio and I‚Äôm so happy that it worked out for me. It‚Äôs quiet and next to the river. 

5. Elitism ‚Äî how will I fit in as a middle/low income teacher? Are there Walmarts around? Lol

This was barely noticeable. My cohort were down to earth but some came from wealth. Didn‚Äôt matter at all. And I found my people at Walmart haha.

6. Best places to visit around Boston or to eat. My fam will probably come at some point would like to recommendations to get true east coast experience. 

Best experiences were the feast days at north end. Lots of places to eat around here as well. My family didn‚Äôt come out however. Haven‚Äôt had lobster roll yet :( or seafood for that matter. 

7. Down time‚Äî how much down time should I expect as a grad student? 

For my program August term was jam packed, but manageable. Fall term I took 19 credit hours. It was also manageable for me (it‚Äôs dependent on the courses you take) - had classes m-th so weekend was time to relax. 

Spring term I took just 12. And only had classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Lots of downtime! Again course dependent- I had a lot of projects I was working on though. 

8. Any other tips or advice! Thanks!

One thing weird is I got a grad meal plan thinking I would be able to use it starting August term‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt start till September. I had some food insecurity the first weeks of August. The receptions and such helped. My school finally is starting a food pantry for students - and I donated food because I went through that experience. 

I think my advice to my past self would be to not worry so much about fitting in, enjoy the short time at Harvard, make good connections and be yourself!

But we aren't certain on any details yet, so we're open to ideas.

There‚Äôs been quite a bit of pushback from the university and so I‚Äôm really interested in connecting with your university‚Äôs sexual violence prevention club/team, as well as determining what y‚Äôall do to monitor or prevent druggings and alcohol-adjacent sexual violence. Like, do y‚Äôall offer free drink tests or toxicology screenings? What kind of accountability structures are in place to prevent sexual violence happening at large parties?

Please feel free to DM me. I‚Äôd love to work with you and prevent sexual violence at Hopkins. Thanks.",hsakt7f,"The key is to have basically no parties, let alone large ones.

Is it really that hard?,i15o0po,"I didn't take the class, but I think I can give you a general idea of how it is like. The material in the class is very difficult (as the math taught is very abstract) and fast paced (covers material from 4 other math courses in 2 semesters), and it is time-consuming, but it is graded pretty leniently. Psets are worth like 60% of the grade in the class, and the midterms are take-home, so if you're at the level of math where you can take and finish the class, you'll probably get a good grade, even if you don't understand a lot of the material.

As another commenter said, many students who take it don't drop because they can't handle the class, but because they don't want to commit the 20 hours a week or so to math. Once you have the mathematical maturity to take Math 55, the only thing that stops you from taking the class is your willingness to spend most of your semester on math. That's why they say don't take it unless you want to spend the bulk of your semester on math or you are seriously considering a career in mathematics.

I don't even think you need to be a genius to take it. I would say most STEM students (in Computer Science and Applied Math, especially, at Harvard would be able to take the class as a sophomore or junior or if they had more background beyond high school math before coming to college. I would say being able to take and finish Math 55 has to do more with commitment than intellect.",20.0,Ok-Kaleidoscope-7320,i15teru,"It's a class designed for the like top 10 math students in the country, who've already had 1-3 years of college level math education in high school (college level here meaning beyond calculus).

I was the worst student in the class my year and the professor called me to his office and told me to drop the class. Now, being my stubborn self, I refused to do that and stuck it out and yeah - it was over my head. In retrospect, I would say if I had been adequately prepared, the class would have been fine, though a lot of work. In the end, I am happy I took the class and I use the material frequently in my day job. It also basically showed me that I didn't want to do a math undergrad (did Physics instead).
