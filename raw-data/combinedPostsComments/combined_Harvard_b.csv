a64il6,"Prefrosh, listen up",533,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/a64il6/prefrosh_listen_up/,23,2018-12-14 12:46:56+00:00,HarvardDating,"Congratulations, you were admitted to Harvard. You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

I'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them. Remember, don't be downwind of John when you and your friends go to pee on him, and, most importantly, YUCK FALE!",ebtdxf3,Come to Cornell,206.0,The_Poseidolon,ebru9eq,"> *and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.* 

fuck lmao",112.0,harverdreject,ebs8r35,"Also important to follow the ""Harvard time"" rule. When speaking to any person that you aren't certain is aware that you are a Harvard student, make sure that you mention it within 7 minutes of meeting them. 
Sometimes this can be tough because people want to talk about things that aren't relevant to your announcement. Getting a Harvard phone case and setting a 7 minute timer is key, if it hasn't come up within the first 6 mins, go ahead and pull up your phone so they can see it and Google whatever subject they are talking about and Harvard, there will usually be something that pops up and work that into the conversation quickly.",99.0,Nickbarc

I mostly got better after freshman year, but still, my unweighted GPA was not very much above 3.5.  I don't remember what it was, exactly.  Long time ago.  Also I did win lots of math competitions, so maybe my un-stellar GPA and SAT were ignored.  Long story short, my family wasn't rich enough to bribe anyone but I still got in.

""But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?"" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&adults=1&check_in=2020-04-22&check_out=2020-04-30&source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from. Make sure to wash your hands before you eat those McChickens, and only cough on the Yalies.",fk3y3qq,"Getting the CGI backgrounds is also a great way to show off.

bxkn2t,Rising Senior: I got rejected from every internship I applied to.,110,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bxkn2t/rising_senior_i_got_rejected_from_every/,24,2019-06-06 19:09:21+00:00,thedietitian,"With the onslaught of celebratory grad school, commencement, and internship posts on Facebook, I thought I would throw a glitch in the matrix and share my story: I was rejected from every summer internship that I applied to. It's the (supposedly) all-important junior summer, and I have nothing to do. But to be honest, I'm kind of okay with it. 

I think rejection stories are extremely important to share. I don't think we hear about them at Harvard as much as we should, but there's beauty in vulnerability. I started applying to summer internships several months ago. I even made it to the third round of interviews at my dream internship, and the company didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I was rejected. I had to ask them. After the onslaught of rejection letters sent to my inbox, I even began applying to random, mostly unpaid internships I found on Indeed, and I didn't get those either. I even applied to sell books at Barnes & Noble and I didn't get that too! And that was supposed to be Plan C.

But I want people to know that it's okay to get rejected. It totally happens. Rejection is not a reflection of your qualifications and self-worth. I do believe there's beauty in doing nothing, and I'm going to spend the summer entertaining myself and achieving my personal goals. I have every intention of sitting on my behind and watching 19+ seasons of Million Dollar Listing. I also want to get in shape and finally read the books on my bucket list that I haven't been able to because of schoolwork. Every time you get rejected from something, you can focus on something that you chose to do and what's truly meaningful to you. I like to think of it this way: I don't have to slave over a task delegated to me by a superior. This summer, I'm charting my own path.

My family is pretty upset about all the nothing I'm doing, and I'm not really sure how to address that. They have high expectations. But I have to say, I'm semi-happy with how my summer is going. Sure, it's cool that my peers are doing internships at Facebook, Google, and L'Oréal. But I also think it's really important to cast rejection in a positive light. You own the time that you've been given. You're free to define the hours as you see fit. I hate waking up at the crack of dawn, and now I can spend my time sleeping until the early afternoon. I hate commuting, and I've gained back three hours of time I would've spent commuting roundtrip. 

I don't really know how to conclude this post, but I just wanted to share that rejection happens to Harvard students and it's totally okay: cast that rejection in a positive light.",eq8tzg8,"If you’re in NYC, I’ll try to get you an internship with an educational nonprofit.

ija9di,It's worth revisiting the Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017...,91,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/ija9di/its_worth_revisiting_the_harvard_meme_scandal_of/,24,2020-08-30 09:47:10+00:00,throwawayharvard2021,"Hello. Throwaway here.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I'm curious to hear what members of this community think.",g3czy0a,"I know who three of those people are, but I was never in that group. I was in another group though and I remember just watching the drama unfold and asking myself how those idiots got into Harvard in the first place. It was a really big deal at the time and I know a few people deactivated their social media accounts for a while, I'm assuming because they probably had posted offensive things when they were younger and they didn't want that coming back to bite them in the tush. 

With all of that being said, I'm not upset that they get to pursue higher education at top universities without the world knowing what they did. Today's cancel culture is brutal and everything is set in stone, or on Twitter. No matter how much a person apologizes and how hard they commit to changing themselves, very few people will see it as genuine and their name will forever be tied to something moronic they said online. Although change and education should be something you do for yourself, not for the sake of restoring your reputation, clearing your name is still important for any future endeavors. Harvard was absolutely right to cut ties with them, I supported that decision back then and I support it now, just like I support the anonymity of those involved. 

Don't get me wrong, being 17 doesn't excuse their behavior, especially in today's world. But I think it's okay that they got to move on, all we can do now is hope that being told to fuck off by Harvard was a learning experience. I know some people were upset that they ""got away without consequences"", but I'd argue that being set back for a whole year and not being able to attend the university you really wanted to attend is an appropriate consequence for their action of creating offensive memes.",41.0,pinkstardust007,g3cxpxz,[deleted],22.0,None,i14knut,"just heard this today:

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

I have specifically noticed a tendency among younger instructors to try to make courses more engaging by assigning more work throughout the week, always on some different and gimmicky e-learning platform. It's a logistical nightmare and just more stressful. Whereas before the virus you might have had a weekly homework/problem set/ reading assignment, now 4 of my 5 classes assign work to be done throughout the week, it's not more difficult to do, but just more difficult to organize. 

For example, I'm taking one course right now that assigns weekly readings, normal right? Nope, with the pandemic, we're expected to make comments on reading by Saturday night, respond to our peers' comments by Sunday night and do like 3 separate video responses. That x4 has already led to me missing some deadlines (profs seem to be understanding at least) and even some sleep deprivation. Is anyone else feeling this?",g4lq7y1,I totally feel this.

That classes as HES are not like that in my opinion. With the exception of one class, all my classes followed a normal schedule of weekly meetings, papers, Zoom session, breakout groups, etc.

I think the type of online education you are describing would frustrate me to no end. While the online technology environment has transferred from HES, I think some teaching lessons and methods have not. TBH, it has got to be hard on instructors & TF's making the shift online also.

Some facts:

&#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

&#x200B;

The most important is #6 as that is an incorrect explanation seen around here a lot.

This case seems much the same. His excuse that he was  just 16, immature, and never-intending to do harm is laughable. No one cares about your intentions - the effects, outcomes, and perception of your actions are what matter.

&#x200B;

He also criticizes Harvard for not recognizing that someone can ""grow and learn from their actions."" Nowhere did Harvard say that it doesn't believe in a person's capacity to grow. Perhaps Harvard did see growth in Kashuv but did not deem it enough. Keep in mind that there are literally thousands of other applicants who are just as, *if not more*, qualified than Kashuv who did not say such offensive, hateful words.

Of course we should forgive the remorseful, and I hate the notion that we all live on a cultural knife edge. But if you're a teenager, remember that you may be a minor with respect to the law, but your words and actions are the main things that an admissions committee could use to judge your true character -- not just the way you present yourself on a (highly coached) application. 

I fully support the decision to rescind this admission. The applicant said he wanted to kill jews, for goodness sake. That's not a slip of the tongue. That's not a benign childish joke or pushing the cultural envelope. That's beyond the pale, and I think we can all accept that nobody is entitled to admission at any particular school.

* ER18: Classical Chinese Ethical and Political Philosophy 

(another great ER gened, really makes you think about what matters at the end of the day. Strange as it sounds whenever I make big life choices I always reflect on the ideas of my favorite thinkers from this class)

* EC10a/b: Intro to Economics 

(will change how you think about society - esp. if you come from a sciences background. great AMHIST gened)

* CS50: Intro to CS 

(I chose a CS concentration last minute due to taking this class sophomore year. You will know if you like CS after taking CS50. If you're really not sure going in then you can get around the difficulty by going pass/fail)

* EC1723: Capital Markets 

(A weird one I know. But similarly to Ec10 it will change how you think about society and how/why money flows to certain places and not others. If you work in tech/finance you will sound like a genius after taking this one class. Whenever I make life decisions about buying/renting, investing, etc. I can confidently make up my mind because I took this one class)

(Warning because the professor changes semi-frequently so be sure the prof has decent reviews. I believe the slides stay mostly the same between profs so that's nice)

* Most freshman seminars in a topic you care about will also be very impactful.

* Some concentrations have Junior seminars. A good one here can also be very impactful espeically if you're trying to get into a lab or go to grad school.

EDIT: Also CS179 Design of Useful and Interactive Computer Systems is basically a UX/UI design class and is very fun. It's a relatively fluffy course you can count towards a CS concentration, and you'll learn so much about working in teams. I use lessons learned from this class in my job every day.",15.0,radar3699

cmztpo,Looking to speed run the three traditions?,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/cmztpo/looking_to_speed_run_the_three_traditions/,4,2019-08-07 02:16:02+00:00,HarvardDating,"While students at other institutions may spend their time thinking about their grades, future careers, or their LinkedIn, Harvard students have a unique set of problems they face: **How to complete the three traditions as quickly as possible.**


No, going as a Yalie for your first Halloween in Cambridge isn't a tradition, but looking around you'll be led to believe it is. The three traditions I'm talking about, of course, are having sex in the stacks, peeing on John Harvard, and participating in the Primal Scream. While STEM concentrations may think they're too busy to do any of this, or that people couldn't *actually* be having sex in Widener, us social science concentrations are well aware of the social pressures put onto every student here to partake in these traditions prior to graduating.

If you're determined, any dedicated Harvard student can complete the trifecta of traditions in less than 10 minutes. Luckily, since typically [65% of the matriculating class are virgins,](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/harvards-class-2017-full-virgins-and-thats-okay/311342/) none of you should have any problem completing **step one: having sex in the stacks** in a matter of minutes. The hardest part of this is agreeing on which section to practice procreation in. While Greek Philosophy is a popular one, I typically choose the *Love Languages* section, just to set the mood a bit.

Once you've completed the first task and left Widener, you should have about 7 minutes left, which is more than enough time to get over to the John Harvard statue. This step is arguably the most important, as **step two: peeing on John Harvard** doesn't only serve to complete the tradition, but is an important measure to take in order to prevent UTIs. Depending on the equipment of your partner you may have to give them a lift, or help each other up, but synchronizing streams, while not necessary, is certainly preferred.

Conveniently, this act can be used to kill two birds with one stone, and **step three: the Primal Scream** is generally an involuntary reaction to the burning sensation you feel while peeing on John after having sex with a stranger in the stacks. Be sure to make it a good one, this is your moment. Everyone's eyes are on you, people are leaning out of Thayer to cheer you on, and they want to hear a walloping, unadulterated scream. Similar to step two, this is a good opportunity to team up with your partner and harmonize a bit. Give the Krokodiloes a run for their money.

After dismounting from the statue, you should have just under a minute left, which is just enough time for the two of you to decide which of you is running to the HEM, and which to Malkin, for you both to shower the shame off. Shake dry hands, congratulate each other, and begin sprinting your separate ways into the night.",ew5udz3,"Assuming that we’re all capable of finding a sexual partner is blatant discrimination against STEM students, smh.

There is also a great network for startups at HBS and the Boston ecosystem you can leverage.

p4bzma,A summary of the discord drama and how it relates to the subreddit,73,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p4bzma/a_summary_of_the_discord_drama_and_how_it_relates/,19,2021-08-14 17:12:43+00:00,toadbro,"Recently, the discord that is associated with this subreddit has gone through some major changes. In short, the members of the discord have completely migrated over to a new discord with the previous mods as the owners.

Why did the members decide to change discords? As another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p3c2y9/wrong_discord_on_subreddit_sidebar/) mentions, this was due to issues with the ownership. The specific issues were summarized in that thread, but the thread was locked before other members could elaborate on the details. The owner was never present, took credit for the work the two main admins did, and refused to transfer ownership even after a vote among the moderators on discord. This server was massive, highly active, and a crucial social hub especially during the pandemic, but almost nobody knew who the owner was. In fact, the owner had as little as 13 messages in the server over several years. This all got intense over the last couple of months as the owner ghosted all of the members, including the admins.

Now, this all just seems like isolated discord drama. This directly relates to the subreddit as the owner and one other admin are the major moderators of this subreddit. Even though the new [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/harvard) is the only active one of the two, the owner of the other discord server changed the link on the subreddit to redirect to their server rather than the active one.

All of these problems are a result of the moderation teams on both the previous discord and the current subreddit. The top moderators are not Harvard affiliated anymore and have been the main power holders for an extended period of time. We would not be opposed to the idea of alumni as moderators, but these particular moderators have shown no interest in being a part of the communities they are moderating and should pass off their roles to active members of the communities.

Perhaps instead of locking threads with questions and ghosting us more, you can take some time and answer them directly. Also, there is still a link to the discord on the subreddit. You should probably remove that if you are totally trying to disconnect from the discords.",h8xjuvb,I agree with the tone of this post. I am confused why the last post was locked and think that more transparency would be helpful. The moderator in question /u/Shotdownace is not even active on this subreddit anymore.

rkw8dt,Why do I feel like all of the professors here are trying to actively pit us against each other…,61,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/rkw8dt/why_do_i_feel_like_all_of_the_professors_here_are/,12,2021-12-20 20:23:04+00:00,shawtzb,"I’m a first year and I just finished my first semester and have been getting a couple of my grades back. I’ve frankly just gotten really frustrated with how the professors here have been grading us in my classes and maybe I just had it easier at my high school or something and I’m bitching for nothing?

But I just think it’s wrong when one of my classes has a policy that only a certain percentage of the class can get an A, so a 96 was the cutoff for an A (which I BARELY made). I just don’t understand how most of my professors proclaim that they’re not trying to pit us against each other and grades don’t matter and then implement systems like this? I went into my math final with a 100% and left with a B+ because I did average (as in I did 4 questions perfectly and the other 2 had some mistakes in it) on the final so that corresponded to a two letter grade drop..?

I’ve just become really jaded especially given that my math professor barely taught us this entire year and so as a result I was teaching myself basically everything. I’m just like maybe this is the reality of college? I hate how everyone talks about grade inflation at Harvard because I’ve had the exact opposite experience, I’ve only had my grades deflated despite putting in my absolute best. I’ve become frustrated because I can’t even enjoy learning anymore because I’m stressing out so much about my grade.

I keep telling myself to be thankful that I’m at Harvard and I absolutely am and don’t get me wrong, I’ve had an amazing academic and personal experience thusfar, I’ve just found that I feel like the way most classes are graded here actively pit students against each other. I mean hell, I went to an underfunded high school and now I’m competing with kids for grades who went to schools like Exeter, Trinity, etc… it just doesn’t feel right.",hpc65vr,"I hear that you are frustrated and you are right to be dissatisfied with the wackiness of grading at Harvard, But I think that you’re betraying the fact that you’re too grade obsessed.

In truth, MAT 157 is the most difficult of such courses, delving into topics generally not covered by even the most experienced of Real Analysts. 

&#x200B;

In the first week, we cover Horseshoe Analysis, showing that even the most insane integrals can be shown to be true with a simple symbological statement. Horseshoe functions are integrable in real space. Currently, we are exploring applications of Horseshoe Induction in the Riemann Hypothesis over finite vector ring spaces. Our class, which began with 250 people, currently hosts 25 attendees, 10 of which who are currently viewing the material from the local psych ward. Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of proving the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) over finite fields in real space. The only prerequisite of this course is High School Calculus, with recommended courses in Latin and Greek Philosophy. All students are required to attend seminars ranging from 5 hours to 11 hours a day in which students discuss Richard and Mortimer and the metaphysical implications of the topics discussed.

I’m not officially supposed to record/mention any specific details or exact quotes so I’m not gonna do any of that but just give a general gist…

Basically both of my readers said that while I was a nice, caring, and empathetic person who had consistent school support I guess from my letter of recs and made note of my experience as a manager in a store along with my marching band experience, they basically said I had nothing distinguishing about myself and that they’re unsure about my strength with regards to the entire applicant pool which lowkey stung. They said that they wanted to see an interview report and compare me with the “full pool” to be I guess more sure of my file/using it as a guiding reference for as to whether I should get in or not. For further reference, I was deferred and then admitted.

My interview report was actually very kind and he ranked me really high (1- in personality, 2+ in academics) so ultimately I think that really helped my case? He wrote a lot of detailed notes about what we talked about and picked up on really small details that actually made me pretty happy that he remembered. 

I mean, I had a very mediocre high school experience and never really planned on applying to an Ivy League so it was as expected. But at the same time the “nothing distinguishing” comment and the fact that they ranked me a 3+ overall, which was also weird cause they ranked me 2 in academics, 2 in personality, 4 in athletics, and 2- in EC, makes me feel like I could’ve easily been rejected and just thrown to the side if just one small thing had changed .

I know that they obviously don’t make mistakes and in the end I’m very happy to be here, but idk some of their comments lowkey kinda hurt and also the fact that 3+ are admitted somewhere at 7-9% makes me feel like I just barely made it in :/ I’ll get over it but yeah bleh just needed to rant",hbd18ar,"Fact is that, while a check to your ego, none of this matters in the long run.  Everyone who gets into Harvard gets in, none more and none less.  And what you do while here matters so much more than anything that came before.  They don't make mistakes - you got this.",61.0,wyckyd_sceptre,hbdoorr,"I don't know if this will help but: first, I was rejected from Harvard (and Yale and Hopkins) for undergrad. I always did well through high school, and that first time being rejected from something I really wanted hurt. But I also went to another good school, and I learned a lot - and now I'm at Harvard for grad school. Which is one way of saying that the outcome of undergrad admissions doesn't really say anything about what you're going to accomplish in the years after that. Presumably I didn't get a very good Harvard Score. That is what it is. I'm still doing fine.

Maybe a more helpful way of thinking about it is also this: in the time I've now been a TF/Phd student here, I've learned more about the way things like admissions works - and it's not exactly pretty. Even just reading applications for a particular *course*\--not even for the university, just one class!--was really weird! Way more people submitted applications than we could have accepted, and almost all of them were stellar. Anyone probably would have succeeded in the class. But we could only admit so many students, so we had to somehow make choices--based on just a few paragraphs worth of an application. Getting from 150 applications to 100 students meant all kinds of hair-splitting and scoring and quick judgement calls based on what was ultimately not that much information. And you know what: some of the students who ""scored"" highest kind of struggled. And some of those who got admitted off the wait list turned out to be the strongest students. I won't say that the process was totally arbitrary--but the sense that you get of a student based on an application isn't always an accurate sense of who that student is. Sometimes you get the wrong read; sometimes things that actually don't say anything about a student's ability to succeed become determining factors, just because you have to find *some reason* to justify making the choice you do. For better or worse.

And that's true of the bigger admissions process, too. The image a committee got of you from an application isn't going to be accurate. It just isn't. All those scores really say is how the things you wrote (which, by the way, are *not*  ""you""; they're just things you wrote at a particular moment) fit into the template of a ""Harvard student,"" based on how the handful of people who read your application read it. Which, you know, whatever. That doesn't say anything about who you actually are.

And let me also just say: I've taught a lot of students who are clearly the Harvard Template(TM). All kinds of insanely intimidating things they've done that make them super distinctive. People who worked on the early 2020 Covid response (as high schoolers ?!?!), people who've already published major books with big publishing houses, people who've spent substantial time in DC contributing to legislation. Impressive stuff. Stuff I don't even dream of doing now! But they struggle in their own ways, too. They're still learning a lot about different things too. And it's fine. Everyone has their competencies, and everyone has things they struggle with. Sometimes those competencies might seem more distinctive - but it's hard to tell anything from a surface. And anyway, there are other things that are important, too.

Which is a really long way of saying: don't let this get to you. Just do you (though don't be afraid to push yourself or step out of your comfort zones!). As you said, you clearly did well in the interview - which suggests to me you're good at talking with people. So talk with people. Talk with your TFs and your professors when you can - many of them (/us) see things that admissions committees don't see as we get a chance to know you. And we're very glad we get to.

It doesn't ""devalue our diploma"" as we knew what we were signing up for when we entered HES, applied for student status, and continued to pursue our degrees there. They didn't change the name on us. We all knew what we were getting ourselves into.

> people think we are in the same pool as those who have taken one online course some random time period ago

Tell them otherwise. Prove them otherwise.

A prominent HLS alum was the first person who told me that I should consider HES for my bachelors degree over top residential colleges that I was admitted to. A distinguished alum of the college concurred with them upon my asking them for advice. It's not as though knowledgable people consider HES a joke - the people who do, in my experience, are not people I wish to academically or professionally impress regardless.

nu0okq,A very odd request from a Canadain,51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/nu0okq/a_very_odd_request_from_a_canadain/,8,2021-06-07 01:24:33+00:00,starchan786,"Hey everyone, 

I'm from Canada and the request I have is probably pretty odd. 

My mum lived out in Eastern Canada and back in the 70s and 80s visited areas like ME, NY, and MA. She had this Grey Harvard sweatshirt that just had the words ""Harvard"" in red across the front she picked up visiting the campus. I wore it a lot as a kid in the 90s and LOVED that thing, but it got lost long ago, how I'm not sure. My mum died in 2016 and over years since you know how one thinks of the past. Well I remembered the sweatshirt and how much I miss having it.

I don't believe the Harvard store ships to Canada and I'm out in western Canada (Alberta) so taking a trip even without covid wouldn't be exactly a day drive. Do any of you guys know where I might be able to order an official sweatshirt? 

It looks like the following without the ""University EST. 1636"" on it, just the the word ""Harvard"" but that colour way.
