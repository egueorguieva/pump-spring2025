It might not be rational, but I have this worry that I’m not “smart” enough to attend (though to be clear I got in ED, so I’m definitely going). I wanted to know what your workload is (hours of study/work a day/week, how many pages of assigned reading a week, etc). Do you find the workload draining/difficult to keep up with? Is it mostly busy work or do the assignments demand a lot from you to get them done? Any information in this vein would be incredibly helpful. I can’t wait to go to your school, and I’m genuinely honored to get the chance to.

Thanks again :)",gertg40,"Hi, congrats on getting in! I’m just about through my first sem here and the workload has definitely been the defining aspect of my life here—that’s not to say I haven’t had time to do anything fun (I’ve made some
of my best memories this semester!), but my plans to generally revolve around making sure I have time to complete assignments. Compared to most of my friends, I seem to have a pretty heavy workload, and how much you have to do definitely depends on number and level of classes. 

I’d say almost none of the work is busy work, I find myself genuinely having to think about most everything I turn in which is probably the biggest difference between college work and high school work. There’s also a lot that isn’t necessarily turned in, but needed for apt class participation or understanding. There have been a few especially rough weekends with psets and a few hundred pages of reading (at least with my schedule, Wed-Fri tend to be more like weekends than the actual weekend) but there are also days with practically nothing. Be prepared to read entire books weekly or even over the period of a day or two. 

Overall, as long as you’re coming here with the mindset that you’re here to work, you should be fine! If you prioritize other things ahead of your work, you can certainly still succeed, you may just find yourself pressed for time in ways you’d rather not be. 

I hope this helps! I’m very open to talking about my experience here so far so feel free to pm if you have any other questions!

As a final note, I will say that some people have managed extremely low workloads this semester by playing off of the fact that we only had to take 3 classes this sem and many were remote, but I imagine this is not indicative of a normal semester.",11.0,Justyn_With_A_Y,ges647u,"Yay!! Congrats and welcome to Williams :))

To take your points one by one: 

Please don't be intimidated by the prestige of Williams! Once you get to campus, you'll realize that 'prestige' is a pretty meaningless concept and, at least for me, entirely irrelevant to anything I've ever done at Williams. No one on campus ever gloats about our prestige -- thank god -- and the rest of the world hardly knows that we exist, so I really wouldn't worry about anything of that sort.

Imposter Syndrome is, unfortunately, very common at Williams; there's definitely an unhealthy ideal of effortless perfection. As far as I can tell, it's something the student body, faculty, and administration all know about. A lot of students come from big-fish-small-pool type situations, so many have an implicit expectation to remain the best at everything they do, which is neither possible nor the point of going to college. All I can say is that you've just been admitted, so don't stress about this kind of stuff: I can promise you that you *definitely* belong at Williams! 

Workload varies by person, of course, but almost everyone I know has fairly busy schedules. In my experience -- and I believe this is pretty standard -- my workload has increased every year, if not every semester: you start taking harder classes, get involved in more extracurriculars, perhaps pick up a job or two, etc. All this can 100% be draining, especially during finals (which are coming up, ugh!). Throughout my time at Williams, I've had to make active decisions about how I wanted to juggle my time, e.g. going to less parties to get more work done instead. It does help, though, that most of my work is genuinely interesting. And yeah, for the most part the work is pretty serious, especially, I think, in higher level classes. 

That being said, please know that Williams students still have fun! Figuring out how to balance everything can take time, but you'll get the hang of it. If you're worried about this, my one tip would be to give yourself a relatively light first semester, so that you can adjust as smoothly as possible.",8.0,RaunchyAir,gesa1v1,Were you a QuestBridge applicant?,6.0,SpongeBobBlab

I’m currently deciding between colleges and I’m really loving Williams so far. The only thing that’s holding me back is that I feel reallyyyyy inadequately prepared for what Williams has to offer. 

I’m not super smart and I’m also not an avid participator (I’d like to be but when I try I start shaking like a hamster). Was anybody else in the same boat and hv advice/can share their experience? 😓",gubpxav,"I think the fact that you are self-aware of this participation issue makes you a perfect fit for Williams -- one thing that I wish I could tell my freshman self is that everyone at Williams, regardless of whether they went to Exeter or an underfunded public school, still has a lot to learn and just because someone was educated with the Harkness method doesn't mean they have anything more substantive to say than a student who didn't come from a prep school background. Most students are in a similar position as you, and they are all more self-conscious about how they sound in a discussion setting than they really should be. You'll find most people are too focused on themselves to judge you on what you said in class. 

And to your point about ""not being super smart"" -- I obviously don't know you personally, but if you're smart enough to get into Williams, you're smart enough to excel at Williams. What's much more important at this point is whether you're willing to work hard to make that happen.

4 years ago i would have said ""so true bestie"", but i realize- who said anything about needing to be super smart and prepared? u got in, and since u say ur not a super smart kid-genius extraordinaire, It probably means you are SO so much more- it did for me. so dont worry about imposter syndrome - because theres soooooo much more to life here. plus- the measurements of smart are arbitrary beyond belief here. 

Added bonus: Everyone here is, in their own special way, a HUGE dumbass. Honestly i wouldn't want it ANY other way. enjoy it, embrace it. the expectations they set are impossible without torturing yourself. its not worth that. don't be ""super-smart"": its not worth it. be happy, frolic, create meaning for time here beyond the ""smart"" label. and ofc, i still mean get ur stuff done , but remember that you, as a human, are also a class you take in the background all the time, and it is the most important one. Four years and I only regret not leaving more time for full-frontal clownery. Dumbassery headassery , tomfoolery, idk -u name it. theres plenty of time to suffer here at the hands of academia without the impostor syndrome kicking ur ass too.

I'm pretty much set on studying CS and was accepted to some schools with more technical programs (Tufts and CMU SCS), but I really like the liberal-arts educational model and think Williams would be a good community fit for me. However, I'm concerned that the CS program simply lacks the depth and rigor that someone with a definite sense that CS is what they want to study would look for—I worry I'd run out of courses in areas of CS that interested me pretty quickly or they wouldn't be available and I'd be forced to turn to research/independent study or take less interesting math/CS courses. Does anybody have a sense of what studying CS at Williams looks like, and if it's possible to have a relatively in-depth CS experience? Thanks to anyone who can offer insight!",foo4hy4,We’ve been hiring a ridiculous amount of CS profs recently so you can expect those course offerings to go up the next few years,9.0,ajax654321,fooftxi,"I majored in CS and thought I got a great education. Williams' program leans theoretical, so you probably won't have a huge catalog of specific technologies under your belt when you graduate - but instead you'll have a deep understanding of common concepts, so you can pick up any tech quickly. 

My first job was full stack .NET (and database heavy), and I had very little experience in any of the languages I was working in - and it was totally fine. 

I also wouldn't discount the ability to do one or more independent studies if there are niche areas you're interested in - I don't know exactly how it works now that there are a lot more majors, but I did an independent study in cybersecurity and research with a professor during my time. Those are opportunities that might be harder to get at a bigger school.

Let me know if you have specific questions I can answer (with the caveat that I graduated 7 years ago when there were far fewer CS majors).",9.0,karlanke,foorol6,"The Williams CS department is growing pretty rapidly, and Williams as a College is much better funded than Tufts/CMU on a per-student basis (meaning, you will be showered with research opportunities, grants, internship funding, project funding, etc.); while Tufts/CMU definitely have more technical programs (CMU's CS department is world-class), there are more opportunities at Williams to do independent studies with professors, take tutorials (two-person courses), etc. Williams, on-the-whole, would give you much more individualized instruction and the professors would be much more invested in your personal success. However, even if you were to exhaust all of the elective/independent study opportunities, you would still be able to spend one to two semester ""studying abroad"" at MIT, Columbia, Harvard, or some other comparable school (a contingent of juniors do this every year) and you can take the courses to satisfy your academic interests. Lastly, there is WEPO (Williams-Exeter Program at Oxford), which would be a full-year at Oxford (where you can study CS as a full-student at Oxford), and Herschel Smith (six or so fully-funded scholarships for Master's degrees from University of Cambridge, given every year to graduating seniors from Williams), in case you were interested in going to England to continue your CS work. 

Additionally, Williams is pretty well recruited by tech firms given its size; there is a really strong alumni network working in tech (in all roles - product management, software engineering, etc.), and the alumni network at Williams overall is pretty legendary.

- students study too much so social life is kinda eh

- classes are demanding and stressful

- very much a liberal echo chamber, which causes discussions in humanities classes to go in circles with students repeating the same buzzwords and talking points, with no-one willing to actually share a meaningful take

- many students are from wealthy backgrounds and are incomprehensibly out of touch with life

- student body is quite divided- by athletic status, financial aid status, race... A lot of people find their clique early and then stick with them",17.0,Stone2443,h476fvu,"Not a current student, but I was accepted and Williams was one of my top choices.

Ultimately, I don’t think that there are really any objective “cons” to Williams. Rather, you have to look at aspects such as class size, environment, teaching style, etc. to determine whether or not it fits you.

In terms of academics, for example, Williams is geared towards one-on-one teaching with tutorials and small class sizes. Its quality of education is top-notch, but this style will not suit everyone. Williams is also located in a more rural area with a small population, albeit with beautiful surroundings for nature lovers.

Ultimately, I chose a school with a larger class size and a more active city because I prefer that environment (this was my biggest factor), but it varies for everyone. At the end of the day, it’s really up to you. It sounds like you might prefer the rural environment, which is a really good sign that Williams may be perfect for you. Hope that helps!

Mountain Day. Classes cancelled on a surprise Friday in October so that everyone can go hike up a mountain.

Once a semester, each student gets to invite a favorite professor to a special dinner. Apart from that, professors often dine/ spend time with students, and professors may invite their classes to their homes for dinner.

Freshman entry system and Ephventures orientation system ensure you meet people quickly as a freshman. “Snacks” is a formal Sunday night tradition bringing the entry together once a week, but entries do a whole lot of other stuff together during the year. The Ephventures orientation program is really fun, whether you are doing something like “Where Am I” when you explore what’s available in the beautiful area from world-class art museums to local stores to short drives or walks to lovely waterfalls and viewpoints, or you are doing something more intense like a few nights’ backpacking trip in the mountains (you choose your type of orientation program).

Opportunities based on the school’s endless resources and its loyal alumni: alumni-funding for any unpaid internship you get, alumni network, funding for whatever your club/organization wants to do, funding for research/ travel aboard/ etc., financial aid covers all your textbooks plus weird incidentals like skiing and snowboarding equipment rentals for PE classes and a suit for job interviews.

I'm excited to hear that you're considering applying here! There's a lot to say about Williams, and I've only been here during the pandemic, so my time here isn't representative of the standard Williams experience. However, I'll share what I feel about the school!

Life at Williams has been great personally. There are a lot of reasons for this, but I guess it boils down to the people and the size of the school. Almost everyone I've met at Williams is tremendously friendly and is interesting to talk to. Unlike my high school, I haven't really felt the vibes of ""cliques"". There are obviously friend groups but I feel like they're a lot less pronounced at Williams. You meet people through different contexts all the time and a lot of people have friends who are involved in different activities, academics, etc. The entry system is a great conduit for this as well. Basically, around 30-40 of frosh live together and have activities like Sunday snacks (which is food + an activity) at a minimum or other things like dinners, dances, movie nights, etc. Some people don't like their entry, which is unfortunate but valid. There are other ways to make friends too, like through a club or classes. 

On top of your standard array of sports options and extracurricular interests, there are a lot of cultural and minority groups on campus as well, which help foster a sense of community and belonging. Because Williams is relatively small, you often see your friends or acquaintances walking around campus. It's kinda nice to just go out for a meal and end up catching up with someone you haven't seen in a while or just waving at people. Another thing I'm starting to find funny is how many friends you make that you end up being mutual friends with another one of your friends.

Classes have also been great! At least for me so far, all my profs have been super friendly and welcoming. You can tell they want to teach you and that they genuinely care. Divisional requirements might be annoying sometimes, but I do appreciate them for incentivizing me to branch out. People are pretty studious because classes at Williams do take time and can be intense! There are a lot of cute study spots on campus (having said that I'm usually too lazy to go to them lol). People do have fun though and there tends to be a decent amount of parties on weekends. I'm not much of a partier myself, but I found a group that I just hang out w/ when people tend to party/get drunk.

The food is meh. It's not bad by any means (I like it) but a lot of people have mixed feelings about it. Could be hit/miss but the dining staff does seem really nice and open to feedback and improving themselves. There's one street on campus that has a few shops and restaurants, which is kinda cute. The most popular shops include a Thai/Japanese restaurant, Indian restaurant, pizza place, and a market/cafe. 

In my first two months on campus I used to joke there's a scenic view everywhere I looked, especially during fall. There's a lot of accessible hiking trails and campus is very pretty. The downside to being rural though is that cities are a decent distance away. Boston and NYC are around 3+ hours away and can be cumbersome to travel to. There are free buses to North Adams (the nearest city) but it is still pretty rural as a whole. I never found this too much of an issue for me because I felt like for the most part, I was kept busy between classes, extracurriculars, and friends. 

Some Williams specific traditions are Mountain Day and Winter Study. Mountain day happens on a random Friday in October where the weather is good. Classes are cancelled and there are hikes of various intensities all day. It's a pretty fun time! Winter Study takes place during January. Basically we take 1 class (can be serious or for fun) and just spend time with friends on campus. 

I've kinda been rambling but I'm happy to elaborate/answer any specific questions you may have lol

mjz30g,Any current students that had to decide between Williams and Pomona?,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/mjz30g/any_current_students_that_had_to_decide_between/,1,2021-04-04 16:06:15+00:00,Havashahaba,Sorry I know it’s specific but if anyone had to make this choice or one like it I’d love to know why you ended up picking Williams.,gtghdll,"I was in this position, and I chose Williams for a few reasons. I skimmed through the answers to your post in the Pomona subreddit, so I'll try to respond to those as well. Disclaimer: they're both great schools, so the choice is likely going to depend more on your own preferences and situation than on qualities of either school.

1. The tutorial system, as well as WEPO (one of the only study abroad programs at Oxford that grants you equal status to a student there), are pretty awesome. I've taken a ton of tutorials at Williams thus far, and it's definitely been one of the defining and most positive aspects of my education here, if not *the*. That being said, not everyone finds tutorials attractive; I happened to, so that was a strong push toward Williams.
2. Williams *is* cold and isolated, but weirdly enough, I wanted that. I come from the west coast, and I was looking to explore a new part of the country. I also love nature, so being surrounded by trees and trails rather than suburbia was ideal for me. The weather isn't great, but it was fun for me to see snow for the first time (admittedly, I've gotten tired of it since...). I also was looking for a really beautiful campus, and I found that more in Williams than in Pomona.
3. My financial aid packet at Williams was slightly better than at Pomona.
4. Personally, I wasn't all that excited by the Claremont Consortium. My majors were best suited for classes at Pomona, so I didn't envision myself wanting to attend classes at other schools. (This is also why I didn't find myself very attracted to Amherst and its consortium). If anything, I was slightly worried that I'd have to face more competition to get into Pomona classes -- but I have no idea if this is true or not.
5. It's true that Williams has a large student athlete body. But if you're not into sports -- like me -- don't worry, since literally no one cares. Especially not recently.
6. I'd imagine that Williams and Pomona are nearly identical in terms of how intellectual its students are. So that probably won't be your deciding factor.
7. One person in the Pomona subreddit cited Pomona's career center in favor of it. I can't speak to the difference between Pomona and Williams here, but I can say that Williams also has a program that pays students for otherwise unpaid internships, and that the alumni network at Williams is super active (it's apparently the oldest in the world -- why, I don't know). Also, the most common employer of Williams students, last I checked, was Google -- take that as you will...
8. Some things I'll concede about Williams: not great diversity (though it looks like we're moving in a better direction, with identity-based housing slotted to come next semester), no easy access to big cities (Boston and New York are both 3-4 hours away, although Williams provides somewhat subsidized travel there on weekends), and not great weather.

Blue Mango (or Korean Garden) -- Asian fusion; again, tasty but not too authentic

Tony's Sombrero (or Coyote Flaco) -- Mexican options; people tend to like Coyote Flaco a lot more but it's off campus. This probably won't be a big deal, since I'd expect everything to be only order-in this semester.

The Purple Pub -- classic pub food, but it's good quality; I put this low since I feel like you pay more and eat less here

Spice Root (indian) has decent food and a buffet but can be quite dark inside.

Tunnel City is more of a cafe than a restaurant but is a super popular spot for kids to study and hang out.

Lickety Split is seasonal but is a quite nice and iconic ice cream stand.

Hot Tomatoes is the best pizza in the area by far but is more often ordered takeout.

Korean Garden is in North Adams but deserves mention- a lot of kids make the drive there as they have decent Korean food.

Chopsticks too- solid and cheap Chinese food not far from campus.

Tony’s serves good and very authentic Mexican food but has a hole-in-the-wall vibe which bothers some students.

p90047,ED Dilemma: Williams College vs. Dartmouth College,13,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/p90047/ed_dilemma_williams_college_vs_dartmouth_college/,2,2021-08-21 21:47:28+00:00,LethalVenom1,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I'm a rising high school senior that is applying to colleges this fall. I've narrowed down my ED schools to Williams and Dartmouth and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding between the two schools. I would appreciate any insight that students had that would help me decide. For reference, I will most likely want to study Economics and do something with math, whether that be either doing a double major or getting a minor in math. I will also be cross-posting this to both r/WilliamsCollege and r/dartmouth to get as much input as possible from current students or alumni.

&#x200B;

In terms of the quality of education, I have heard good things about both schools, especially in regards to their econ departments as they are very popular at both colleges. I think the math department at Williams is quite a bit stronger than Dartmouth's, though. Moreover, both schools say they're ""undergraduate-focused"" but I think this is more true of Williams where classes are smaller than Dartmouth and fewer students are competing for research positions and stuff like that especially in a major as popular as econ. Some Wiliams students I have talked to said they even chose Williams over HYPSM because of this and said that Williams has the best quality of education in the world. Does Dartmouth compare? Also, Williams has the Oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.

&#x200B;

The Alumni network also matters to me a lot since I am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. I've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. However, Dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from Dartmouth than Williams. While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in. I don't really know which is better, but I would say maybe Dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but I would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each school.

&#x200B;

This is kinda unique to Dartmouth but I don't know whether the D-Plan is on net good or bad. I've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. Sophomore summer and ""Camp Dartmouth"" sound cool too. I've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. I've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.

&#x200B;

In terms of the campuses, I, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either Williams or Dartmouth. Architecture and the ""look"" of a school matter to me a lot though. I really like the rural vibes of both the schools. If anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.

&#x200B;

In terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. However, the people at Williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at Dartmouth, which I've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what I've picked up from the vlogs I've watched and things I've heard. Williams concerns me a bit because I have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. However, Dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.

&#x200B;

That brings me to greek life. From what I have heard, Dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. I have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. I don't really think I would enjoy frats and I'm even more concerned since if admitted I will be on lots of financial aid so I don't know if I'll be able to afford to join one if I wanted to down the road. I have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. I'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I know this is really stupid, but the ivy league pReStIGe is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about Williams but most people know about Dartmouth. I am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but I was wondering if the Ivy League branding that comes with Dartmouth really matters in the future?

I would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between Williams and Dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school. Thank you in advance to all who reply!",h9uj55l,"Hi u/LethalVenom1,

I hope your college app journey is off to a good start.  Echoing u/14thethumb's comment on the same post to r/dartmouth, I think you're putting too much thought into the wrong things right now.  As a preface to my thoughts, I remind you that both Williams and Dartmouth are ""under-graduate centered"" particularly because the schools provide myriad resources for their students to explore different academic arenas before committing to any one career path.  This can be incredibly valuable, and I encourage you to keep this is mind if these two schools are your top choices.

&#x200B;

Something I can vouch for as a current Williams student are the small class sizes and availability of research.  Professors are accessible and, for the most part, invested in students' academic trajectories.  The tutorial classes offered can be very fun - I took two in my first year at the College and had no regrets - courses where I had perhaps my most intimate and productive academic discussions with a professor out of all my classes.  I'd describe classes at Williams as Ivy-level education but with the bonus of accessible professors, more office hours, engaging discussion-based lectures, and incredibly detailed feedback on your tests and assignments - features not always afforded at larger HYPSM schools.

&#x200B;

>'While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in.""

This is where I lost you. Understand that both schools attract top firms and graduate schools each year - at this level, playing the numbers game isn't going to matter.  What you need to look at are the big things: Dartmouth has a dedicated business school, and Williams does not.  I'd imagine Dartmouth's attention to pre-professional programs influences the larger percentage of its graduates who choose to enter consulting after graduation.  That being said, Williams has an incredible Economics and Math department - rest assured, both schools will prepare you for your current career trajectory.  As a Williams student, I'm afraid I'm not in the position to provide any specifics about the quality of Dartmouth courses (or the D-Plan) for your prospective major - I'm sure your crosspost will help you out with that.

&#x200B;

In terms of location, the two schools are similar.  Williams is situated in the bucolic Purple Valley of the Berkshires, and Dartmouth is nestled in the cozy community of Hanover.  You can't go wrong.  Since Williams does not have Greek life, parties and gatherings will take place mostly in dorms or on off-campus housing, and it's relatively quiet and unobtrusive compared to some notorious fraternities at Dartmouth.  Despite the small student population, I've never felt isolated at Williams, nor did I feel like I got to know everyone in the first week of classes.  For me, it's the right size.  I know that feeling is not universal.  One thing I noticed quickly at Williams was the lack of a competitive grade culture.  Williams students are no stranger to stress, but I found we actually bonded over the late nights and difficult tests instead of competing with one another.  Many professors reinforce this collaborative environment with engaging discussions and, in smaller classes, specific attention to each student.  (I've had several classes that have taken place outdoors, and professors who walk campus with their students and regularly invite them into their homes to speak about life!)  It made me so much more comfortable working around others and discussing classes without feeling like it was a constant race for the grade (which, trust me, gets old really fast after you leave high school).

&#x200B;

The most important thing I can convey to you as you finalize your ED schools: talk to current students.   I remember in my own college search having read every online review on College Confidential, r/ApplyingToCollege, and Niche that I could find and stewing over the stats for each school.  This will waste your time.  Talk to real students and ask them about their experiences.  At this stage, I think hearing those stories may help with your final decision.

&#x200B;

Williams College is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a rigorous and uniquely personal academic experience surrounded by natural beauty.  I always liked to walk back from my Economics office hours late at night and look up at the stars - such little light pollution in the Purple Valley makes for some incredible night skies.  On my way to my art history class, I would always walk through the cow pasture on Stone Hill and hang out with them for a bit before heading to the Clark Institute.  Cows?  On a college campus!  Perhaps that anecdote only reinforces the fact that Williamstown truly is in the middle-of-nowhere, but how cool is that?

I wish you the best of luck - we'd love to have another Eph on campus!",13.0,parabolicpineapple,h9ugv73,"I am not a current student myself,  but I am the parent of a current student and I am an alumna.

You named what I believe is probably the biggest difference between the culture of the two colleges: fraternities vs. zero fraternities.

Williams has a warm and inclusive feel, aided by structures like the freshman “entry” system. An entry is a group of about 40 students living in the same dorm, sharing three or four unpaid junior advisors who have no disciplinary role whatsoever but function like big brothers/ sisters. The entry system gives every new freshman people to eat with and hang out with from the moment you arrive on campus. “Snacks” is a tradition of meeting more formally as an entry every Sunday night, but entrymates also go together to plays and concerts and sporting events on campus, and to things like art museums and hikes and apple picking off campus... not to mention eating dinner together or hanging out and studying in the Common Room. The Ephventures orientation program gives you an intense multiday experience exploring the surrounding area, whether by van or by backpacking/camping (freshmen choose their program) that also creates yet another friend group.

Parties at Williams are open to everyone- part of the no-frat thing-  but there is still a lot of drinking going on, especially freshman year. Still, there are many people who either attend parties to hang out but just don’t drink OR who hang out with their friends attending campus cultural events or just hanging out casually in the dorms.

It is also really easy to join a club or activity at Williams.

Williams actually has great connections in investment banking and consulting, the biggest-name firms (McKinsey, Bain, etc.) come to the campus to recruit, and it is a very popular career choice for Williams students. But Dartmouth is also extremely strong in this area.

A tutorial is, indeed, an amazing experience!  With a very few exceptions (think intro courses in psychology and art history), Williams classes are small and discussion-oriented. And professors are excellent and very accessible.

You mentioned the math and economics departments. Students at Williams love the math department, which is known for its friendly and playful environment as well as being intellectually challenging and good. And economics is the most popular major at Williams.

You said campus matters to you. Williams has a pretty campus in that it has great views of the surrounding mountains. But I think Dartmouth has nicer buildings and a more unified look overall, although the Williams library is impressive and the library quad with its marble blocks is very nice.

The Williams name will be admired by grad schools and by certain employers, such as those in  investment banking or management consulting. In terms of the general public, yes, the Dartmouth name is better known, and if they don’t know Dartmouth, they will be impressed if you tell them it’s Ivy League. Whereas your cashier at the local grocery store or your gas attendant or your Great Aunt Sally may never have heard of Williams and not know that it’s a good school. Generally, there is one of two reactions to saying you go to Williams: “Wow, that’s such a great school!” or a blank look and maybe a question, “Do you mean William and Mary? Roger Williams?”

Both Williams and Dartmouth are outstanding colleges. Good luck in the application process. I hope this helped a little, but hopefully you also will hear more directly from current students at both schools.",9.0,Wordwoman50,,,,

2. I think it is a very rigorous and intense school, but it is ultimately very rewarding -- the work doesn't feel excessive or like drudgery, and the education sets you up well for anything later in life. In terms of work-life balance, however, that ultimately depends on the student but there is a lot of opportunity to do things that aren't just schoolwork -- sports, arts, performances, student groups, etc. The school does provide a lot of funding and faculty support for extracurricular endeavors.

I'm just a freshman on campus, but here's my perspective on your question. Success, of course, looks very different for everyone on campus, but I find that Williams tries pretty hard to provide everyone the resources and services to facilitate our individual definitions of success. 

If you're talking about doing well in classes, there are a whole host of resources available -- peer tutoring programs are especially prevalent: the MSRC (math and science resource center), Economics Resource Center, and Writing Workshop are three that come to mind. Practically all of the academic resources are available to everyone on campus (there may be some positions held for ESL students) and all are free. Also, I've found office hours very helpful and honestly super fun. Professors are usually more than willing to meet with you in an appointment outside of their set office hours if you cannot make them. Generally, work at Williams can be pretty intense, but everyone adjusts to it in due time. 

If you're talking more about success after college or in internships, jobs, or research, the '68 Center of Career Exploration is very involved and helpful -- you can schedule a sit-down meeting with a career advisor on your first day on campus if you want. There are also a lot of research opportunities, but you'll learn more about that once you're here.

pgshak,Williams vs Swarthmore,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/pgshak/williams_vs_swarthmore/,5,2021-09-02 22:43:52+00:00,lyd_ahmadi14,"Hey folks! New here. I'm a high school senior from NY planning on applying ED to either Williams or Swarthmore. Looking to major in history and pursue a PhD and/or JD in the future, but I'm flexible (of course haha).

Was hoping people could shed some light on the differences between the two that I *can't* find on the website. I know all about Swat's honors program and Williams's tutorial program--love both! I like the Williams campus and school spirit more than Swat's, but I feel a more politically left and grad school prep vibe at Swat.

Differences in diversity? Does Williams have a preppy jock vibe? Which is best for someone ambitious but also politically conscious (I am a well-researched and published Marxist). Thanks guys <3",hbe8c01,"Both colleges are outstanding. You can’t go wrong here. In fact, there are more similarities than differences between them- all the benefits of a small college, with small classes, close relationships with professors, and deep, rich classroom discussions. In addition, the student bodies at both colleges are intellectually vibrant and enjoy “the life of the mind.”

In response to your questions, I believe that both colleges are similar from a political standpoint. Both lean liberal, and the students who are the most vocal activists are on the left end of the political spectrum.

There are two commonly made comparisons on these forums that just seem not to match reality. 

One view has Swarthmore as crazily intense and Williams as more relaxed. Honestly, I think that Williams now has all the same intensity that is traditionally attributed to Swarthmore. Plan on studying a lot at either college.

The view of Williams as preppy or jock-heavy also rings false. First, athletes don’t dominant at all. Yes, there are a lot of athletes, and yes, there are some ways in which certain athletic team cultures can be a bit isolated from the rest of the students. For example, if you are a male fall helmet sport player, you probably will spend more time with your teammates, while the rest of your freshman entry (dorm group) is spending more time together as an entry. However, if you are a nonathlete, except for cheering on your entrymates at some events, you probably won’t be thinking much about athletics, because you will be busy with other things that interest you, whether those are music groups, theatre groups, a variety of activity or special interest clubs, hiking and the outdoors club, etc., etc. There is so much to do at Williams, and there is a fascinating variety of interests!  The students there tend to be passionate about their intellectual and extracurricular interests, but to have a wide variety of interests!

Second, ‘preppy’ definitely feels wrong. The students come from a wide variety of backgrounds. And the way the freshman entry is set up, friendships are formed between people from very different backgrounds, socioeconomically and otherwise. In terms of clothing and culture, I would say that most kids wear things like jeans and sweatshirts or T-shirts, and, if I were to unfairly stereotype the wide variety of students, I would probably say “nerdy” is much more predominant than “preppy”!

So, how to choose between the schools?

Swarthmore is suburban and a short train trip from Philadelphia for a quick weekend visit. Williams is rural and remote, surrounded by breathtakingly beautiful mountains. Swarthmore has a more uniform stone look, while Williams is more of a hodge-podge of architectural styles. You may be drawn more to one physical environment than the other.

Each has its own hallmarks. I know Williams better, so I will speak to its unique attributes:

1. The tutorials are indeed awesome: just two students and one professor, where each week one student writes a paper based on the readings, taking a stance, and the other student responds to it with a critique.
2. The freshman entry system involves about 40 freshmen living together alongside 3-4 unpaid junior advisors, who have no disciplinary functions but act more like big brothers or sisters. There also is the Ephventures orientation program (where you choose your own adventure, which might involve exploring local attractions like art museums or going on a backpacking trip in the mountains). Between the two, you will begin your Williams experience with a built-in group of people alongside you as you adjust to college— people with whom you will go to dinner, hang out, etc. It’s a nice way to start your college experience.
3. Winter Study - Whether you’ll love it or hate it, you’ll be at Williams in January, taking one pass-fail course, with a variety of fun topics, travel options, independent study options, etc.
4. The Mountains- Where else would the school song be about mountains and a favorite college tradition be Mountain Day? Mountain Day is a random Friday in October when classes are cancelled that morning so that students can go on organized hikes up the local mountains.
5. Opportunities- The resources are incredible. Financial aid covers not just the basics, but every book you need for class, skiing or snowboarding equipment and costs if you take one of these for PE class, even a suit for your interviews if you need one. And even if you are not an aided student, you will benefit from the college’s resources by receiving money for your student club to go on trips to tournaments or events, and from alumni-sponsored internships, and various other benefits. And the alumni network is actively involved and very supportive. 
6. Also, you said you like history. The history department at Williams is absolutely amazing! Great courses, wonderful professors.
7. You also said you might pursue a JD. The Law Society at Williams offers both a Moot Court and a Mock Trial Team, and these provide fun socialization as well as some like-minded peers. And the tutorial system will prepare you well for making and defending an argument and critiquing someone else’s argument!

Two amazing colleges. Try to visit or talk to some current students at each. It may come down to whether you prefer proximity to a city or to the mountains. Or you may just go by your gut feeling, where you feel more ’at home.’ Probably, in truth, most people who would be happy at one of these colleges would be happy at the other.

I am very interested in Engineering, but my main concern would be the difficulty of the course load, considering that you have to finish a 4 year degree in 3 years. Does anyone have any advice or experiences to share about this? (such as how difficult it was, how it could impact your GPA and social life) ",fm6cnfa,"A few thoughts that might be useful for you:

1. As I'm sure you'll have seen on the Williams website, only 3 people have done this program in the past 20 years. I'm not personally aware of any of them.
2. I imagine this is because relative to the set of options available to most Williams students, this isn't necessarily one of the most attractive ones. For instance, leaving Williams for Columbia after junior year would be pretty disruptive to the roots you'll have made on campus, and the research opportunities and advising available at Williams will likely be far harder to come by there.
3. If you compare completing this program to finishing all 4 years at Williams and then going to a graduate program in engineering, the first option gives you a bachelors in engineering in 1 year and the second gives you a masters in engineering in 2 years. Even ignoring what you'd miss out on during your senior year at Williams, the better of these options to you would depend on how much you'd value saving that one year.
4. All that said, if you're really set on doing this program, you're not going to have a courseload that different to an many normal physics majors. Although it's true that you'd ""have to finish a 4 year degree in 3 years"", graduation requirements at Williams are very lenient compared to many peer schools. Almost all Williams students take 32 courses across 4 years, but to graduate you only need ~10 courses in your major and 6 more to complete distribution requirements. This is why double and even triple majoring are very commonplace at Williams. If you took no electives at all, you could probably finish every requirement in 2 years without taking any extra classes (although that definitely would be difficult and would make no sense at all). 


Hope this helps! If you have any more questions, definitely feel free to shoot me a PM.",8.0,OpenNewspaper7,fmq4w4p,"While the 3+2 combined engineering programs with Columbia/Dartmouth are not popular, engineering professions are nonetheless a common path for Williams College students. Students interested in technology-based engineering (software engineering, solutions consulting, data science, OR etc.) generally major in statistics, computer science, and/or mathematics whereas students interested in more physical engineering (civil, aerospace, etc.) generally major in physics and/or any other major/concentration relevant to the career track (e.g. environmental studies, chemistry, material sciences). There are a handful of students each year who go to graduate school for engineering, and a sizable portion of each year's class enter engineering jobs as well. 

Additionally, spending 4 years at Williams and 2 years in engineering graduate school makes more sense for an engineering career rather than 3 years at Williams, 2 years at Columbia/Dartmouth, and an additional 2 years at graduate school. The undergraduate degree in engineering doesn't give you a substantive edge over a research-intensive liberal arts degree when it comes down to graduate school, and the only significant advantage of completing an undergraduate engineering degree is if you want to go directly into a physical engineering profession (and possibly skip graduate school altogether -- which is also a valid career route).

Also, a handful of juniors at Williams every year ""study abroad"" at MIT, Harvard, and Columbia; during these years ""abroad,"" students can take courses in engineering (with few exceptions) which helps prepare them for directly entering engineering post-graduation/entering graduate school for engineering. This is also a more common route than the 3+2 combined program.",3.0,Farquaado,fnptyw2,"I am not sure how things work at Williams. At the liberal arts school I started, I just needed to complete most of the requirements of the major while I was there and fulfill the minimum graduating requirements.

To be safe talk to the 3-2 engineering liaison at your college I am sure they will be able to help you with all of this and career paths if you are deciding between a masters.",1.0,zaizar33

Thank you if you are reading, and I would appreciate a response!",hfieu59,"1. Yes. For an international student on financial aid, unless you have a hook (some sort of ultra-stand-out  thing), you should assume the only way you'll be accepted is if you apply ED. 
2. Yes
3. There are many singles, some doubles, some shitty dorms, and some nice ones. You will probably only get a shitty dorm as a sophomore - freshman and upperclassmen typically have quite livable housing situations.
4. No, but most of the year is cold enough that it's not really a problem.
5. Competitive enough, but your SAT is a little low. Unless you have something that really stands out, it is difficult to get accepted, regardless of test scores.
6. HUGE yes on this one. Beautiful campus. It gets even nicer in the fall, and the winter has its own beauty as well.
7. Yes.
8. The food options are good enough. Sometimes it sucks, but generally it's good.
9. You will be safe. Most people on campus are too worried about offending anyone to be racist. You may experience unintentional microaggressions, but it should be a rare occurrence. There is also a tight-knit international community here so you should have no problems making friends. (Confession: in my opinion, international students are the friendliest and smartest people at Williams)",7.0,KenVatican,hg14zaj,"Just to add to the other comments:

ED is great, if the estimated family contribution on the net price calculator works for your family and you would be happy to attend Williams if you get in. Nearly half the class is admitted ED. Financial aid for internationals is not as sure a thing as it would be at the similar Amherst, which is one of only a very few US colleges to be need blind and meet full need for internationals.

Dorms:  Yes, there is a common area kitchen in many dorms. No air conditioning in the dorms (although I don’t know what they’d do if you have a documented health issue— they very well might accommodate you with a unit— you could ask.) It says on their website that wired Ethernet is turned on only if you request it, but there is a procedure for requesting it. There is WiFi everywhere. There are not problems with using a laptop for schoolwork, but Facetime calls work more smoothly in some locations than others.

60% of freshmen live in singles. Your friend group’s lottery number determines whether or not you will be able to get a single sophomore year— or if you are friends with a housing coordinator, they can pull you up with them. During junior and senior year, everyone can get a single, and seniors can also enter the co-op lottery.

The weak spot for Williams, amid all its many wonderful strengths, is its attention to quality of life aspects. The dorms are often not so well maintained. Plus the dining is much less good than it is at, for example, Bowdoin or Middlebury. And this year, dining is a disaster: they cut back hours, leading to long lines, made it impossible to reenter the serving area at one venue, and temporarily suffered from a shortage of forks (which was brilliantly spoofed in their student humor publication, The Haystack).

The surroundings are beautiful, and the college takes advantage of its location with walls of glass in the library through which to view the mountains, as well as traditions like Mountain Day, a random Friday in October when it is suddenly announced that classes are cancelled and everyone hikes up the local mountains (organized hikes range from easy to difficult, on different trails, and nonambulatory people can take a bus to the top of a smaller mountain/ hill).

Not all parts of the libraries are open 24 hours, but there is a 24 hour study room in the main library.

It is hard to imagine a “safer” setting than the remote, rural, college-centered Williamstown.

And, as another poster noted, it is very cool to be an ‘ally’ and very uncool to express overt prejudice.

The most amazing and satisfying aspect of Williams, though, is its academics. Brilliant professors and peers you will interact with through many small discussion-oriented classes, including the incomparable two-person tutorials.",3.0,Wordwoman50,,,,

>Williams College is also unbelievably cliquish. Because the campus is small and geographically isolated you will soon find that living there means that you are quickly identified, sorted out, accepted or isolated, and conveniently locked into place. For those who settle in the area, the rule of thumb is that you are not accepted by the locals until you are a third generation inhabitant.  
>  
>The social pressures for ideological conformity are immense and enforced on the campus by the faculty, administration and your fellow students.For example, in 2017, the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) named Williams College as one of the top ten worst schools for free speech.

And from a Williams alumni...

>Unfortunately, I have found this to be absolutely true. As a current student, I don't want to give away too many identifying details… but just Google “Williams College Council"" and see what comes up. Absolute inanity, combined with a perilous lack of common sense. I'm not Christian, nor am I really a conservative, but I saw very clearly just how hurtfully my Christian friends were ostracized even if they weren't conservative, and vice versa. Not to mention that I've become a bit of a pariah myself for speaking my mind… that is to say, arguing radical leftist policies that literally encouraged ethnic cleansing and were often wrapped up in a heavy dose of bigotry, even if the students and faculty involved refused to acknowledge the obvious....  
>  
>But it's also desperately isolating in a way that goes well beyond “rural area.” There is a clear social and political narrative and if you disagree with a single plank, you are quite genuinely ostracized. I know because it happened to me. I disagreed with one single idea out of pure moral practicality, and I was unceremoniously kicked from group chats, shadow-banned from most clubs, and made to lose quite a number of personal friends. This was not an uneducated opinion, either -- I made the statement that I did on a subject that personally affects my family and myself, in which I have an (admittedly young) lifetime of experience, and in which I also happen to be focusing *both* of my academic majors. It is too bad that the Twitter-esque mentality of echo chambers and dogpiling overwhelmed reasoned discussion, to the point where I am now happily enjoying my year abroad on a different continent. Who knew that the Middle East - missiles and all - could be a more sane and reasoned environment than an elite American liberal arts college?

I'm a conservative Christian but I would never attack or belittle someone for their beliefs and know when it is best to keep my mouth shut. I know that everyone has a different experience on campus but really, how often do incidents like this happen nowadays?

\[Edit: When it comes to controversial issues, I am open to discussion as long as long as people are being respectful. I just don't want people shoving down their beliefs down my throat, as I wouldn't do the same to them.\]",flxcnil,"I was somewhat worried about these things when I was in high school, and I spent a lot of time stressing about them before I went to school. Frankly, after spending a year here, I am genuinely curious to whether these people have actually spent a lot of time on campus or are just trying to stoke irrational fears. 

I haven't really talked to anyone who's experienced the first commenter's concern. In fact, I think social groups are actually substantially more porous than they were for me in high school at the very least. I've never had any problem moving through circles of athletes, nonners, internationals, etc. The fact that the campus is so small means that a lot of people have overlapping courses and commitments, so I don't think it's much of an issue. 

I've never had an issue speaking my mind, and frankly I've never seen anybody have their free speech restricted, so I don't know where that comes from tbh. 

The alumnus, while I do not know them personally, is not representing the situation well at all. I am a Christian, deeply involved in faith-based life on campus, and very vocal about my faith. I have never had a problem with being ostracized due to my faith lmao, and neither has anyone in any of the faith organizations I have participated in. So tbh, I have no idea where that is coming from. Further, although I am a STEM student, so I supposed I may not be in these sort of courses, I don't think I've heard any of my professors advocate for ethnic cleansing lmao. 

I'm sorry that this person was ostracized, but like.... I kind of doubt this story. I've had many disagreements with people about politics and religion that go against the ""narrative"" of the college, yet I remain in several group chats for the clubs I am in :). I don't think this is an especially common circumstance, and I wonder if this individual is truly representing his situation accurately. 

I think that there is a lot of political diversity at Williams if you look for it, I am simultaneously close friends with a moderate republican, a hardcore libertarian, and a devoted Marxist, that doesn't seem very echo-chambery, but maybe that's just me. 

If anything, Willams strikes me as very apolitical relative to most college campuses. It's obviously going to be liberal. It's a liberal arts college, it's in the name! But I seriously think that Williams is more conservative than even my local university back home, and certainly more conservative than like Brown or Sarah Lawrence. These fears are understandable with all of these people spreading stories online, but take it from me, what they are describing is either severely overblown, missing some key components, or just flat out fabrication. Feel free to pm me, I always like to talk to prospective students!",15.0,ydavid25,flxd7aa,"There can definitely be a feeling at Williams where you have to watch what you say, but I have never found it too restrictive or the effects overly ostricizing.

During both my first year at Williams when I was deeply engaged with the religious community and my remaining 3  years, (or rather 2.8 with the transition to distance learning this spring) I have found most students to be very open minded and to deviate strongly from the stereotype of radical anti-free-speech shaming circulating online.

Looking at the post history, it seems like I'm just one of many who have/will be stopping by to spread my own and indulge in your enthusiasm about the school. If anyone is willing to field questions/let me DM them, please let me know.

I've been burying my nose in the course catalog, crawling through the deep depths of the [Williams.edu](https://Williams.edu) website, and scrolling (as it continues to be updates) through Willipedia ever since I first visited in March. But I'd still love and feel I need a more up-to-date, personal student perspective — one that isn't coming from admissions, either.

\- Mainly, for anyone, I'm wondering what your experiences are with trans students on campus — how many there are, how well they are accepted, how supporting the general environment (in academics, athletics, extracurriculars, dorm life) is. If you're trans yourself or have a close friend whose experience you feel might be relevant, please share.

\- I'm also wondering about how to fit my interests into the (32!) classes I could take at Williams. I'm looking at majoring in some combination of English (with some creative writing)/CompLit (Track 2) and Political Science/Political Economy. While that on its own might not be too difficult, I also want to take full advantage of tutorials — would it be too much to try and take one a semester? I'm also interested in WEPO — how would this shift my major/courseload plans? And, a question more generally about majors — how should I balance major/elective coursework? Is it better to load up on major-relevant courses or to let a few slip by in favor of a passing interest in Sociology, per se?

Please comment any info you think might help me work out these questions.

Thank You,

A (Hopeful) Future Eph",expdfn9,"Williams LGBT culture is changing FAST. I graduated in 2016 and in that time, the number of trans kids, especially those using they/them pronouns, absolutely exploded. People are generally respectful of pronouns, and when they're not, they get schooled quickly. 2012-2016 saw the first student transition officially on campus, the highest number of genderqueer students, the first time the JA system realized they needed to reconsider their super gendered system, etc etc.

Re: sports—the first student to transition with the school (i.e., get name/gender updated in the system, etc) was on the women's hockey team and they loved him, but in general I would say that the general trend for queer and trans kids on varsity athletic teams is that they eventually end up quitting, especially those that start out playing on male teams. That doesn't mean they're actively discriminated against, but the culture is just very stereotypically cis/hetero within those teams. Another thing that can be tough/an impetus to quit is that you can't really be doing hormone therapy while playing DIII sports—this is true at any school though, not a Williams-specific problem.

I would say that showing up to campus openly trans is easier than coming out later. You want to get your entrymates on board with your name and pronouns right away, as that's how it'll spread to the wider community. Especially because you may not be super close with your entrymates after freshman year so they may not get the memo. In general I would say the community at large is supportive, the professors are somewhat awkward/clueless at times but are trying/getting training (another reason showing up in the system with your correct name/pronouns is better than trying to change it later), and although a lot of people show up to campus knowing nothing about trans people, they learn quick.

I'd say from what I observed, trans kids whose gender identity wasn't obvious from their presentation struggled more to get their identity recognized/accepted. Williams students don't really ask for pronouns unless it's obvious they need to, so if you present like the average person who uses she/her but use he/him or they/them, or vice versa, the average Williams student may not ask for your pronouns, remember to use your pronouns, or even respect your pronouns when you/your allies push back.

That being said, trans kids whose trans-ness WAS obvious from their presentation were obviously more at risk in general—western Mass is pretty conservative and rural, and there was at least one incident. Not sure what the school could have done differently to prevent it, though.

But honestly, this may have completely changed—it's been a few years and the few years I was there, and a lot changed then as well.

ETA: Maybe get in touch with the Davis Center and see if they can put you in touch with current QSU people—although I would caution that a certain amount of criticism of Williams from current students can be a good thing—i.e, it shows people are comfortable criticizing the school/that the school has a healthy amount of activisim.",4.0,doyouoverthink,ex7428b,"Hey, class of 2023 here. I may not be able to answer some of your more specific questions but you can message me with any other questions abt Williams.",2.0,None,ex8bql9,"Can't really answer too well for your first question because I do not identify as trans. From what I observed, the experience does seem to be variable. People will accept and respect you, but it's difficult to predict if you will feel that ""belongingness"". 

For your second point, I do feel like it's rather difficult to fit in one tutorial in for every single semester, though some of my classmates definitely took advantage of tutorial classes whenever they could. Luckily, the departments you're looking to major in do hold many tutorial classes that will help you fulfill degree requirements. The major requirements for Williams, in my experience, are very few classes compared to other colleges. Obviously, you will not get to take every single elective you want, but if you're willing to put in the hours and the gods of scheduling stay in your favor, you can take up to 40 full-semester classes at Williams (4 required class + 1 extra class per semester... I think you do not have to pay extra for the additional class, but I could be wrong) and only about 9 of them are devoted to your major. Your WEPO interests should also align quite well with the majors you want to pursue right now. 

But, again, try to get admissions to connect you with the students who are currently on campus. Yes, they're trying to sell you Williams, to a certain extent. But they're also looking for prospective students who will have a good fit for the school and flourish there instead of spending every moment of their college career feeling miserable. As far as I know, none of the students they connect you with get anything out of you attending Williams, so they will not be trying to trick you into going there by painting an idyllic picture.",1.0,purofound_leadah

I was just accepted to Williams as a sophomore transfer, and I have some questions about music lessons on campus. I have been taking piano lessons since January, and I’m really enjoying it. I’m even playing a beginner version of Clair de Lune!! Can I sign up for official lessons at the college if I’m only a beginner?? Do you think I might be somewhat negatively set apart in an environment where there are so many talented performers? And would peers maybe be willing to help me learn, if need be? I’m just trying to see if this is something I could pursue at Williams in a more structured manner, and I appreciate any input you may have.  Thank you for your time!! ",ek8x2ga,"Ok, to preface, I'm not at all involved with the music program -- this is just what I've heard. As far as I know, beginners are 100% allowed and encouraged to participate in the school's subsidized music lessons (free). The only problem is that some instruments are rather popular, so Williams can't provide lessons for everyone who requests to learn it -- there are only so many tutors. This means that for the popular instruments, there are placement tests that prioritize the more advanced so that they can continue their craft. I'm not sure how competitive getting piano lessons is, but I do know someone who is taking piano lessons and isn't amazing at all. I wouldn't be surprised if Williams prioritizes people who don't have to start at the very beginning but also aren't incredibly advanced, but I'm not entirely sure.

If you're motivated to continue music, you can always take lessons in a less popular instrument. This being said, I've heard stories of people taking guitar lessons without any experience. Also, you can always just reserve one the Bernhard Music Center's practice rooms (or just walk in) and practice on your own. Or you could join a music group on campus that requires little experience / are willing to teach you (I think Kusika is like this)

Again, not part of music on campus, but I find it VERY hard to imagine people would be biased against beginners. I'm not sure if there are peer tutoring programs in music, but I would be a little surprised if there were -- lessons are fairly intensive and frequent enough to give you partial class credits. If nothing works out, I'm positive you can find a friend on campus that is willing to help you learn on the side -- it seems like everyone played piano in high school.

Congratulations on getting in, welcome to Williams, and I hope you enjoy previews!

2) how friendly the offcampus/town environment is to minorities 
3) is there relevant activities and stuff to do like at least a hour away or so? What do students do offcampus?",ho9axfy,"1.	I’m a Berkshire local and a Williams student and I’d say it very much depends on your definitions of “active” and “local” lol people sometimes go to North Adams for Mass MoCA or to eat but it’s not NYC. However if you do need NYC or Boston they are about 3 hrs away, if you can find transportation. Most people don’t go often if at all but the NYC locals sometimes do a couple times a semester.
2.	 Again I’m a Berkshire local but not a minority so I can’t really say. What I’ve heard and seen is that this is a VERY white and very liberal area so you’re likely to see ten times more BLM signs than black people, FWIW.
3.	 There’s a ton of stuff to do on campus and people stay very busy with schoolwork and extracurriculars. If you like hiking and museums you’ll be fine but if you want to go clubbing or Michelin star dining you won’t find that. Williamstown does have like 5 coffee shops, two upscale thrift shops, a yoga studio and other stuff tailored to the Liberal Arts taste.",5.0,wordflow,hoc7mse,"1.

(Just for info lol. Reply to my comment or dm me if you want more info bc it took me a while to figure out & id love to help)

2. I'm not sure, but I know there are a lot of on-campus communities for minorities (there's an entire community resource called the Davis Center, which is a space for POC. There's free snacks, a free kitchen to cook in with friends, other resources, etc.)

3. Activities kinda depend. There's lots of restaurants, a movie theater, etc on Spring Street (across the street from the college), the nice Williamstown Library, and more. A lot is definitely on campus. But you can always visit Albany and Vermont; touring Vermont could be a pretty easy option, if you take the 8 AM bus to Vermont, hang out and explore the different stores and events from 8 AM to 3 PM, then take the 3:30 PM bus back to Williams, Pretty nice because the green mountain vermont busses are free. 

Also, Lyft and Uber work in North Adams but not Williamstown itself. You can get a Lyft from North Adams to Williamstown but cant get a Lyft from Williamstown to North Adams. So def expect to use the BRTA (berkshire buses) to go places",3.0,Competitive_Dot_2295,,,,

Williams College has become my dream school over the past few months and I was thinking of applying with ED. 

I'm an international IB student who didn't think of preparing for an American Uni until now, which means that I haven't thought of preparing for the SAT until now (I'm in Grade 11). When I took practice tests, my scores weren't very high to submit to the school (definitely not in the 25th percentile) and was delighted to hear that Williams went Test Optional for a few more years. 

But since it's not test blind, test scores are going to be considered for ones who put it in, and I'm torn between trying to prepare for the SAT while doing IB (which is already rigorous) or just taking my chances and focusing on my GPA. I did read somewhere that students who submit their scores had almost double the chance of getting in compared to those who don't have scores... which makes me a little nervous.

It was an incredibly valuable educational experience. I felt like I learned more in that class that I have in any other class ever. That said, it can be very difficult (depending on who’s teaching and what department) and I imagine two tutorials is a bad idea (just overly burdensome).

They were both fantastic for me. The former was more concentrated on writing and producing high-quality film analysis in a cinematically-stylized video essay, so I developed the ability to use Adobe Premiere for something serious and quite meaningful instead of the many goofy things I had done in it before. The latter was more concentrated on reading theoretical texts and reading films as texts. Because there was so much emphasis on reading (visual and written texts), I feel like my ability to analyze films within their real life contexts grew so much from that class. Both great courses run by knowledgeable professors who know how to utilize the Tutorial format to optimize the subject they are teaching. Since the meetings themselves require you to put so much work in to prepare, they are that much more thrilling since you really come to know the kind of dynamic you, your partner, and your professor have together. Williams is hard and hard to keep up with, but I’m not kidding when I say those courses kept me excited and engaged throughout.

I'm pretty much set on majoring biology with a concentration in neuroscience but I'm hoping to explore the Cog-Sci program too. I was accepted to a few other universities with more focused neuroscience programs, but Williams is a better fit for me (most colleges have amazing academic/social opportunities, but I know I'll thrive better as an Eph) and I appreciate the ability to pursue a liberal arts education. At Williams, neuroscience is only offered as a concentration and cog-sci as a program. There were less than 20 neuroscience courses, 4 of which are independent studies, and around 5 cog-sci courses, 3 of which are independent studies. I'm worried I might run out of courses to take or won't have enough neuroscience-related research opportunities to pursue, which is concerning because I'm hoping to go to grad school after graduation. If my primary interest is neuroscience and cog-sci, would it be better to go to a research university with a renowned neuroscience program, or do you think Williams has enough resources for me to receive an in-depth education and be a competitive applicant for neuroscience/cog-sci grad school programs?",fp11okb,"If you like the Williams environment, then Williams will be excellent preparation for graduate school in neuroscience/cognitive science, and you would be at a huge advantage when applying for graduate programs down-the-line. To address your concern about the number of courses, first, the majority of students take 32 courses over their four years at Williams, which means you would be very hard-pressed to finish all of the available cognitive and neuroscience courses available. Additionally, while the liberal arts environment encourages taking courses across disciplines, it is also perfectly situated for students such as yourself who know exactly what they want to study; at Williams, you'll have tremendous opportunities to go deep into topics with expert faculty-members, and the research experiences you'll get are rich and intensive. I wouldn't discount the independent study opportunities/thesis opportunities at Williams - graduate schools care a lot more about research than taking a lot of courses in the a particular discipline, and Williams is so well-resourced in terms of faculty and financial resources that you would be showered with attention and opportunities.

In summary, the research opportunities, faculty attention, and resources at Williams will put you at a huge advantage when applying to grad school.

My husband and I were drawn to Williamstown because of the geographical location and a host of other opportunities for our family. We’re interested in moving to the location regardless of whether I would ever be able to attend this school or not.

With our son going into school of his own, I’m about to have an opportunity to invest in education myself. For the past several years, I’ve wanted to earn a degree. As a teenager I was accepted to art college which I did attend briefly, but I ended up leaving due to inner city violence. Add in family drama and I ended up moving out of state and not going back. I got married, had our son, and have been working for the past 7 years.

The truth is, a decade ago, I was an average student. I put my energy less into academics and all into developing my art and college portfolio. I never took the SAT because the art path didn’t need it. Now I’m afraid that because I didn’t fully apply myself academically 10 years ago, I may have harmed my chances of going to school now. 

Despite average transcripts, I have some extracurricular achievement. I am an accomplished writer. I finished Nanowrimo twice, writing 50,000 words in a month both times (1,667 words a day.) My art was published when I was 16, and I won multiple art-related awards. I also suffered a debilitating nerve disorder, completely relearned to walk again, and graduated from physical therapy after 8 intensive months. My experience as a mother has taught me the importance of discipline, responsibility, and efficiency that I took for granted a decade ago.

My concerns are, do any of these things matter in my chances of being accepted to Williams? The major I want, Japanese, is uncommon and I can’t find it as an online degree. I have been to Japan and I’m certain this is what I want. I’m willing to work my rear off to cram and take the SAT now. I’m aware of the residency requirement, and it seems Williams does grant exceptions for students that are married/have children.

Does anyone know of non-traditional students attending Williams at all? Was anyone accepted with less-than-exceptional academic record? How about SAT score?

My husband got his associate degree from Penn State University while our son was newborn, so I know we can work together to make this happen. He’s completely on board with this.

I applied to Williams last year under RD and got rejected which was pretty fair to me but this year I have decided to bring some changes to my application. I understand that every application procedure is different and one cannot pin down what will get me in however it will be really helpful to me if I can get some feedback. So here are the changes I will bring:

1. will submit my SAT score
2. will submit my mid-year report
3. have done considerably more MUNs than last year
4. will submit a dance supplementary video
5. have been teaching this kid English for the past 3 weeks (intend to teach till Nov)
6. part of literature club and editorial club (have done some minor things but still pretty close to me)
7. working on a website
8. working on a research paper
9. (common app) Essay: I will bring some slight changes to the essay that I submitted last year
10. will be a certified yoga teacher so I guess that will come into play

&#x200B;

So far these are the changes that I will bring to my application. Will be a real help to me if you could provide your feedback on it.

P.S. I am an international student and my EFC will remain the same as last year which is around$5k and will apply under ED1 for this fall.",h2gt2ml,"I think those changes will help you out. There's one thing that I think could help you out even more, actually! :)
So, I noticed you've been doing a lot of different activities. Yoga, teaching English, website, research paper, and dance... you've got a really diverse skillset. I think it could make for a really strong application if you found some way to tie those activities together in an essay or some other piece of writing, if there's any connection that can be made. For example, imagine writing like, ""I really like helping others, and by teaching this kid English and teaching others yoga, I've been able to help people with both the mental and physical parts of life. I hope to do more like this for others at Williams."" Or something like that haha. When a person ties together the different things they do, it can make them seem like a super powerful character or something, haha

Btw, how come you're planning on making slight changes to the common app essay? Do you feel like it was a good essay and you just wanna tweak a few things, or do you think the Williams peeps didn't like it? I think the essay can be a really strong point to win over the advisors, so I'd recommend showing it to peeps like friends and teachers and see what others think. I'd love to help out with that if I can--you can always DM me for any help with this stuff :) I don't check my reddit very often, but since it's a couple months until the 2022 application opens, I'm sure I could help you out <3

As far as job opportunities go, the CS department does a stellar job at communicating available opportunities. They frequently send out emails with information about various opportunities for internships and post-graduate research programs. There are also many extremely intelligent CS majors. In conclusion, the Williams CS program does not disappoint.

2. Unfortunately, this question is very difficult to answer, because the ""best and worst things"" are just so dependent on who you are as a person. Some might say that it's the ""jock"" atheltic culture, which comes from 30% of the school being recruited athletes.

Williams bills itself as a ""need blind"" school like many other highly selective US colleges. However, I heard from students at Columbia and Penn (other need blind selective colleges) that they and a lot of their classmates were advised to apply for aid **after** they received their acceptance letter. They claimed that these colleges were, in fact, not need blind in practice. A student who got in Penn ED waited until May to apply for financial aid, and a student at Columbia I know said that a lot of their class applied after their acceptance. All students mentioned were domestic, and I am a domestic applicant.

In fact, Ivy Coach wrote a [blog post about it](https://www.ivycoach.com/the-ivy-coach-blog/college-admissions/2-reasons-need-blind-admissions-farce/) where they called need blind admissions a ""farce,"" claiming that ""colleges are not need blind as they may suggest so freely to applicants and their parents. Now there are a couple schools that are straightforward — they’re open and honest about being need aware. But all of those colleges that claim to be need blind, they too are need aware. They’re just not as honest about it."" as well as ""If a college actually did this, that college would not be able to sustain itself. It would have to dip into its endowment. Tuition is vital to highly selective colleges. It’s why tuition fees are so high. Schools would never make this error. They take need into consideration, even though they say just the opposite.""

Williams students who receive aid, is there really a disadvantage to applying for aid with your application? If so, can a student who gets in Early Decision apply for aid after acceptance? Will this impact the award in every way? 

Stay safe, y'all.",g1ws1uy,"There are two ways in which one could argue that Williams is not need-blind.

1. They are not need-blind for international students. They openly state this.
2. Adam Falk said during an interview  that, when recruiting domestic applicants, one could say that the college isn't need blind in that they actively try to recruit and assist low-income students through the admissions process. When it comes to this, it might actually be more appropriate to say the college is ""need-seeking"", but that ""need blind"" would still be appropriate in that no domestic applicant would never not get in bc. they need financial aid.

It's very unlikely that Williams would be lying about being need-blind. Williams is in a much better place to fund undergraduate financial aid than places like Harvard, Columbia, and UChicago because of its endowment and small size.",6.0,Ruth_Badar_Ginsburg,g1twhqm,"Around 50% of the school receives financial aid. It seems unlikely that Williams is need aware if that is the case. Furthermore, I personally feel that Williams administration is highly benevolent and transparent, so I would be extremely surprised if there was anything sketchy surrounding financial aid admission practices. Anecdotally, I was admitted to the school (although off the waitlist) despite requiring financial aid. 

I think that the sentiments that ""need blind admission is a farce"" may stem from certain deceptive practices that other schools exercise. For example, it is believed that the UChicago waitlist is not need blind, despite the fact that regular admission is. Therefore, in the case of UChicago, it would probably be better to submit your financial aid after you submit your application. Fortunately, Williams explicitly states that their waitlist is need blind, so I believe there is nothing to worry about regarding Williams.",5.0,KenVatican,g1tjiah,International students with their 5 need-blind colleges be like: 👀👀👀👀👀,2.0,koolpotato21

Largely, academically, the transition was fine for me. All of my classes were lecture based. The one class that I had that relied more on group work was transitioned toward a tutorial format, which was fantastic and which I hope many professors try if the fall semester ends up being virtual (and I’ve given that feedback to the college). That change definitely gave me a better relationship with the professor, created accountability (because you’re accountable to your group mates and have to have something to show for your work in a face-to-face meeting with the prof once a week) and probably enhanced my learning of the material. 

For the classes that relied only on recorded lectures, it was tougher. I was able to keep myself accountable and watched them more or less on schedule, but I understand that it would be harder overall for some people. I also don’t have too much trouble learning from someone talking at me, but other people who really prefer discussion, q&a, and breakout sessions as part of their learning experience would have been disappointed. 

Finally, the logistics of TA sessions and office hours were different. Arguably, TA sessions and office hours are easier to attend virtually, but there is a lot that is lost in virtual TA sessions. I was a TA last semester, and attendance dropped drastically after the transition. I had like 13 students every Tuesday night, the atmosphere in the room was great, people collaborated on problems on the blackboard. After the transition, I had one or two students each week, who mostly just asked one question and then logged off. Also, if you’re not up to date with the lectures, then TA sessions and office hours can’t help you much. So if you have trouble keeping yourself on track, or some family emergency or something means you end up cramming in a few weeks of lecture at the last minute, you lose the ability to take advantage of those resources.",9.0,jello34,,,,,,,,

mi3re5,Going into foreign policy after Williams?,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/mi3re5/going_into_foreign_policy_after_williams/,8,2021-04-01 20:05:16+00:00,vaeporwave,"Hello,

I was wondering if it is easy for Williams undergrads to go into foreign policy (e.g. working in global affairs for the Government, working at a Think Tank, etc.) after they graduate. Are there students at Williams who have these aspirations, and how successful are they with their goals?

The reason I am asking is because Williams doesn’t have an international relations/global affairs major. However, in every other way besides major offerings, Williams is my dream school (I hope that makes sense). I was thinking the best supplement for international relations is a major in economics and a concentration in global studies. However, I want to know if I would have a solid shot at going into the foreign policy world with a degree from Williams or should I look elsewhere?

Thank you so much for your help.",gt51o9n,"This is a very common path, and Williams is very well-connected in government, law, and policy. Williams has one of the highest number of current alumni serving in office (4 in the House of Representatives, 1 senator, tons of state congresspeople, a few members of the extended presidential cabinet, etc.), not to mention the College is very well-respected in DC and several prominent lobbying/PR firms and law firms were founded by Williams alumni. There is an annual trek to DC that the career center organizes (paid for by the College) where students go to DC and meet alumni working in government, policy, and think-tanks. I can give you more info on how well Williams is represented on Capitol Hill to assuage any concerns you may have, but given how strong the alumni network is and how well alumni do in this field, Williams will give you a huge advantage when trying to enter this field down-the-line.

Generally speaking, the political science major at Williams works like this -- you major in Political Science, but you have to specialize in one of four subfields (international relations, political theory, etc.). Additionally, you can also concentrate in global studies and/or double-major in a language/ethnic studies, leadership studies, etc. Further, there is a Political Economy major, which is fairly unique, and is essentially a Public Policy major, and you can double major in PoliSci and Econ if you were interested in both. The major itself is really flexible like that.

Lastly, Williams offers tremendous opportunities outside of academics to gain exposure to foreign policy, policy research, etc. Williams showers undergrads with grants for research, travel, foreign language study, policy research, etc., and this aspect of Williams can't really be found at other colleges. All-in-all, Williams will help you tremendously with trying to enter the foreign policy/government field.

Hope this was helpful-- happy to elaborate on any questions you may have.",6.0,Farquaado,gt3dne2,"I’m just a student, so not really a super knowledgeable source, but I’d say a Williams education would set you up extremely well for such a career, given the catalog of courses available and the presence of the CDE. I don’t have statistics, but anecdotally I’ve known a few people who went into such careers after graduation and afaik are doing well.

A lot of political science classes at Williams are very much foreign policy related as well. I think a major in political science or political economy coupled with electives in economics, sociology, and environmental studies might be your best option.

Economics is a bit more abstract and quantitative than I think a lot of people realize before coming, especially in the core courses.",3.0,Stone2443,gt5kdke,"You've gotten some good responses here, but I just want to add that if you're interested in foreign policy at Williams you're right, there is no specific global affairs program, but Williams prides itself on staying at its Liberal Arts roots.

It's not a school where many people specialize early on. Sure you have some people going on one path early and sticking to it, but you can save your specialization for your graduate program. I would recommend using Williams as a place to learn how to learn, and a place to expand your horizons. You want to take courses from professors that interest you, and courses you might not have chances to take in the future. 

As was mentioned elsewhere Williams has connections and courses that will set you up well for a career in politics both foreign and domestic. But take your time working out how you want to achieve those goals. You could go into public policy, go into a think tank, get a masters or phd degree, get a law degree and practice, or even use Williams as a jumping off for a political career. My one recommendation would be to not limit yourself because they don't have 'X' major. Take your time, experiment with courses and professors and with your idea of what you want to do. Then when you find your direction you'll have the network and skills to make that idea reality. 

I hope that helps and isn't too vague or long winded! Good luck! Also that guy who just said those jobs don't exist is an idiot lol.",2.0,None

All the college essay blogs say it's just a bad idea to submit the academic paper, but I am not sure. 

The Williams admission website says it's ""entirely"" optional to turn in the supplemental essays, but I actually doubt that. But, unlike Amherst, Williams lacks explanations for option 4, which is submitting an academic paper...? Also. ""in the last year"" means within the past 12 months, right? 

I got a good grade from that essay and my teacher wrote down really good comments as well... so I am not sure if this choice is really against my chance!

Thank you!!!",gii9mmk,"I honestly don't even remember that being an option when I applied (class of 23), but I could be wrong. I personally wrote my supplemental essay in response to the prompt about the entry system.  

You're absolutely right to doubt that the supplemental essay is really optional. Although I'm sure it's possible to get in without writing one, putting in the extra effort and doing it is a great way to reaffirm your interest in Williams. With a school as selective as Williams, it's best to do everything possible to give your application an edge.  

All in all, I think it's a better idea to write a new essay responding to one of their prompts than to submit an academic paper. Submitting a paper you've already written takes less effort than writing an entirely new essay, and it's best to avoid anything that could be interpreted as laziness/lack of interest in Williams.

If you feel *that* strongly that you have something special to offer and that Williams is the right place to explore it, I don't think it would be bad at all to email a professor or adjunct in the music department whose interests overlap with yours.

Here's the good news, you can't make a wrong choice here. Both schools give you a good education, have thought provoking and caring professors, and a vibrant student body. The upside of Colby is that because they are so intensely remote there is a very strong campus connection. This is true at Williams as well, but moreso at Colby. The benefit of Williams is easier access to places like Boston etc. if you want to get away even though it is still remote and in the mountains for the most part. Both have January terms, Williams does have Mountain day which I think is an absolutely phenomenal tradition. You should also consider that Williams is a more difficult school to get into, and ED is your best shot of getting into your stretch in general.

I think overall there's not a huge difference in the two. If I were you I'd think back to my visits, think about the things you liked and didn't like at each place, and don't be afraid to just decide on your gut or a small opinion. You can't go wrong here either way. Good luck!",7.0,None,,,,,,,,

Some articles I read indicated it's not a useless major (and that some significant tech companies even go out of their way to hire philosophy majors to work on machine learning, the comp sci subfield I'm most interested in), but I'm not sure it adds much value, employment-wise, beyond the comp sci major.  It would still be fun though.  I've also considered a second major in mathematics.  If choosing is too hard though, is it unusual and/or super difficult for people to triple major at Williams?   What about swapping out one of these potential majors for a concentration?

&#x200B;

Thanks to anyone who helps.",eljqqv8,"It is possible to triple major, but I wouldn't worry about it too much. From an employment perspective downstream I agree it's probably good to have a STEM degree on your resume if you want to go into e.g. a tech job (probably CS if you want to do ML, but probably math and/or stats could work too). Beyond that, I'd just focus on taking courses you're interested in and getting the most you can out of them. If you wind up with a second or third major or a concentration (or something close enough that it's worth finishing) then great, but I wouldn't kill yourself to get there unless you really want to do it.

As an aside, you might like to explore the cognitive science concentration at Williams, given your interests. There are some good professors / classes involved, and it does a nice job of bridging between some of the fields you've expressed interest in (CS, philosophy).

For background: I was a math & philosophy double major and did a cog sci concentration (and took a bunch of CS) at Williams and subsequently worked in tech.",3.0,JFoss117,,,,,,,,

If I continue this semester on my current path, I should have around a 3.8 GPA. My question is what is the overall vibe and culture at Williams in terms of the student body? How’s the campus? Would I have a good shot at getting in based on my GPA and current situation as a transfer student? Thanks!",hgzfltu,"Of 356 transfer applicants last year, Williams admitted only 9, as per the Common Data Set ([https://www.williams.edu/institutional-research/files/2021/09/2020-2021\_CDS\_Williams\_College\_tuit-2.pdf](https://www.williams.edu/institutional-research/files/2021/09/2020-2021_CDS_Williams_College_tuit-2.pdf)).

But your grades are good, so there is no harm in giving it a try, even though the odds are slim. Perhaps also try for many other similar small schools.

The campus has some great aspects, with gorgeous mountain views, a beautiful library, an attractive library quad, a walkable campus also with walking distance of hiking trails… and two less nice aspects:  Route 2 bisecting the campus (not too terrible- it is a two lane road that is much less busy than the double yellow lined two lane road in my suburb at home) and dorms that are in various stages of aging/upkeep.

Students vary, as is true anywhere, I suppose. Lots of nerdy types, lots of athletes (and somewhat different cultures between those two groups)… people who like to party, people who like to play board games or video games, people who like to hike or bike or canoe, people who like to sit and around and talk with friends, lots of attendance at concerts and plays and speeches and campus sporting events. The students are nicely diverse, from a wide variety of backgrounds. You can expect to have friends from different racial, cultural, national, state, sexual preference, and socioeconomic backgrounds from yourself. 

As a transfer student, you won’t have the unifying experiences of the freshman entry experience, so I would recommend getting involved quickly in an organized club or group or a club sport, in order to make friends. That’s the best way to meet people, although you also can ask someone you’ve been talking to in a class to join you afterwards for lunch. You will meet people and find friends, *though it will take effort and initiative to do so.*  In general, though, people are friendly and nice.

But the reason to go to Williams is the academics. IMO, that’s where you will love Williams. If you crave intellectually stimulating conversations with brilliant, caring professors and bright, interested peers, Williams is THE place to go. It is hard to imagine that a college education could be better anywhere else. For deep thinkers, Williams is nirvana.",12.0,Wordwoman50,,,,,,,,

\- Maybe the essay prompts harder this year (? IDK if they're different but maybe students got started on the ""storytime"" one and then read that storytime has been canceled, something like that)

\- Maybe Zach Wood's book caused negative impressions of the school?

While the tuition cost into a problem, the “un-feasible” part about applying to the school is due to a variety of variables. One of them being the student loan debt crisis the United States is facing. As I look to the people who are 10-20 years older than me, and continually receive the advice of “DO NOT GO INTO DEBT” or well at least enormous debt, it had an off putting vibe to it which ultimately resulted in  my decision to not apply to the “elite” LAC’s. 

Another reasoning for revoking my own application from most of the NESCAC schools, is due to the schools environments. While I know Williams is undeniably elite in its academic rankings, and social connection ratings, one thing I couldn’t overcome was the overall emphasis on school to work ratio. After all, its college, and with that I don’t want to delve into a four year program filled with un-healthy amounts of stress, depression and binge drinking at a relatively smaller school, which seems to have a culture similar to a high school environment. Yes, Williams may set me up for a nicer job in life, and place me into a higher social network, but the average 18 year old (aside from myself) is most certainly not thinking about the long-game. Applicants nowadays I believe, have woken up to the notion that maybe their dreams aren’t obtainable anymore, so instead of paying the application fee (unless you have a waiver fee), they have given up entirely and set goals which are more obtainable and bring satisfaction. Not only this, but kids are also looking at more value schools. From a general consensus of my friends, everyone is either opting for a state school, or banking on over 1/2 tuition.

* The number of computer science majors has skyrocketed to more than 120, but no new faculty member was hired for this fall. Consequently, as of now, it is hard to get into core CS classes (>136) if you are not a major.

* The math department is wonderful.

* The physics department is wonderful too--and at least as weird as you would expect.

* The biology and philosophy departments are also great.

Study spaces:

* The new South Building has opened, and in it new study spaces.

* Schow is better deeper into the library. White noise machines make it very quiet. But some seniors have reported they prefer to be surrounded by stressed out Div I and II majors in Sawyer than stressed out pre-meds in Schow.

* Being that ""rando"" who sits at a senior's research carrel is an all too common occurrence.

Food:

* Driscoll is an excellent dining hall.

* The '82 Grill (in the basement of Paresky) has good snack-bar food.

* The student-run coffee bar is moving back to [Goodrich](https://sites.williams.edu/goodrich/) Hall after its year in Dodd. They have heterodox, if not heretical, cream cheeses.

Nerd Culture:

* The physics common room (PCR) is frequented by an unusual concentration of people who know elvish, and periodically plays a unique game called krockball.

* WARP is the Williams Association of Role-Players. They play tabletop role-playing games as well as several cool board games.

* The Aristocows are a Disney-themed *a cappella* group.

As a liberal arts college, Williams's philosophy is that students should gain rigorous problem-solving and research experience in a broad set of fields, acquire skills to ask questions and solve problems (rather than acquire skills as an end-goal), and experience ""the world"" in an enriching way beyond a singular professional goal. As such, you'll have fewer opportunities during the academic year to study ""healthcare administration,"" although Williams is one of the top feeders for top graduate programs in business, medicine, public health etc. (there is some WSJ article that ranked it just behind Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Princeton). 

What would prepare you well for a career in healthcare administration is to do well in your courses (there are lots of courses in public health, healthcare economics, bioethics, etc.), work on an independent research project/thesis related to some aspect of healthcare (healthcare economics, healthcare policy, public health, etc.), and intern in a healthcare administration setting. For the latter goal, there are a few unique resources that Williams offers to help with: Williams has a great alumni network that can help you with securing internships in healthcare administration (e.g. the last CEO of the Cleveland Clinic was a Williams alumnus); Williams also supports 150-250 unpaid internships every year with a stipend of $4,600-$5,000+/summer depending on your funding source; Williams also has strong connections to regional hospital/healthcare systems, and every year students intern/shadow part-time to get hands-on experience in the local medical system.",1.0,Farquaado,fsbw67l,"Williams can prepare you for almost anything.

One of the things that attracts me to Williams is the exchange program with Exeter College, Oxford\(WEPO\). I'd be curious to hear if anyone has either first\-hand experience with this program or knows anyone who has gone.

I'd be interested in hearing both about the academic side of things as well as student life.

I've met visiting students from a number of American colleges who are here for a term or multiple terms or the full year, and most of them actually get to live in their Oxford colleges, whereas visiting students on WEPO live off-campus and outside of city centre, in Summertown.

i'll be blunt: there are several professors in the department with major failings as educators. they're all smart, interesting people that are very knowledgeable about their domains, but some of them simply can't deliver a coherent lecture, create an environment for discussion, or communicate feedback effectively. i'd say 3 (out of 9) are awful at all of those things.

that said, there are a couple professors that shine. i took 5 of my 9 classes in the major with one professor, and 3 of those were among my favorite classes i've ever taken. of the 4 classes i took with other professors, 2 were among my least favorite i've ever taken.

but take all this with a huge grain of salt&mdash;i have strong feelings about several professors in the department and i know people that totally disagree with me. i'd highly recommend you get a second opinion before you make any kind of judgment.

&nbsp;

as to what the department is like, there are 9 professors, each of whom specializes in a field (mostly) unique within the department. basic summarization of their fields:

- classicist/logician

- applied ethicist

- contemporary ethicist (normative and metaethics)

- kantian scholar

- quasi-continental

- cognitive scientist/phil. of mind

- continental/feminist

- wittgensteinian/logician

- philosopher of science/various

I am so attracted to specific programs( WEPO, tutorials, etc.) that I am even considering applying ED.

I am, however, a bit worried by the stereotype of Williams students as smart but unambitious athletes who study/drink/party and aim for jobs on wall street. Someone on CollegeConfidential stated that he felt socially isolated at Williams as someone who enjoyed discussing literature in his free time.

Obviously, I'm confident that the above stereotype doesn't apply to most Ephs  and it does seem that most students are really intelligent and driven. However, I am curious if Williams does have a dominate alcohol/athletics/wall street focused culture or if one can find a thriving ""intellectual"" scene?

TL;DR: Could I fit in at Williams as a non-white person who enjoys having intellectual/literary conversations outside of the classroom, doesn't drink, and is idealistic about ""changing the world""(not pre-professional)?

",dwanlb3,"An anecdote:

A couple of evenings before sophomore fall started, campus was relatively empty. I took to wandering about various dorms in search of conversation. I found myself welcomed by a small, somewhat tame party of people chatting and drinking in Lehman Hall, no more than ten or so, attended by a junior I knew. I felt no pressure to drink, and listened to the conversation for a while. At my inquiring about philosophy, I was quickly introduced to a philosophy major, who made impressive observations about solipsism considering his intoxication.

The philosophy major turned out to be a philosophy, math, and computer science triple-major with a concentration in cognitive science - among the smartest people I have ever met.

&#x200B;

I was admitted to Williams earlier today and am excited to potentially attend, but I have a few academic concerns.

&#x200B;

I was browsing through ratemyprofessor's website in order to see how well or poorly the professors in STEM fields were regarded. I mainly stumbled upon extremely old ratings of professors that do not teach here anymore. I do plan on doing pre-med and major in Chemistry, so I was wondering what everyone's perceptions on this department (or STEM in general is)?

  
A few more questions:

1. How large are intro science classes? Such as Physics, Bio, Gen Chem, etc.
2. Are STEM majors a minority at Williams?
3. Is there flexibility in choosing professors? The course catalog shows only one person teaching Intro Chem/Bio classes, so I am worried about the class-sizes for intro courses and the inability to switch professors if one happens to be bad or highly irrational.  


Thanks everyone. I will also be visiting Williams for Preview Day (if anyone (STEM major or not) would be willing to talk to me one-on-one - I'd greatly appreciate that)",eivhwkd,"I was really terrible at Chemistry because I didn't have a good base course in high school. While there was one professor I did not feel was the greatest lecturer in the world, the Chemistry faculty, on the whole, were engaging in lecture. They were also very understanding of my concerns and went out of their way to help me learn during office hours. Most of the rating/criticisms for Williams professors are posted on WSO's internal professor rating system, and even those are opinions at the extreme ends of the class in general. 

1. Intro classes are quite large. I believe we had about 70 students in the intro Bio and Chem courses when I took them. They do try to separate Chem class into sections according to the students' background knowledge in chemistry. (At least, they did when I was taking the course)

2. I wouldn't say STEM majors are a ""minority"" at Williams from my experience. I imagine you could look for published stats on that one. A lot of people also double major across the divisions. 

3. There's not really a flexibility. Usually there is only one professor teaching each class. If you really wanted to avoid someone, you need to wait a whole year and hope that they do switch the teaching faculty for that class. That said, you're always going to find yourself dealing with people you find ""bad"" or ""highly irrational"" in life. A part of college education is rising up to that kind of challenge. At any decent higher-level learning institution, you're going to need to take responsibility for your own education regardless of class size and quality of instruction. I would say, on the whole, Williams almost coddles their students by offering ample office hours, constantly reviewing and making adjustments, opportunities for peer tutoring and open tutoring hours, and making sure there are times available for you to introduce yourself to the instructor. At least, that was my experience in science classes as a non-STEM major.

This will be a further part of your education, as dealing with extremely qualified people, respecting them, and being able to learn from them while not necessarily liking them personally will be a part of life after school, too. 

I hope you go to Williams and enjoy it, but if you're worried that the professors might be 'highly irrational' and frustrate you, frankly I don't see anything we will be able to say that will assuage that.

Thanks!",dvwwkvf,"Tutorials are overall less common in Div III (Science and Math) than in the other academic divisions. As it so happens, I am currently taking my second Div III tutorial.

From the professor's standpoint, it requires a considerable amount of time to teach tutorials - each pair needs to meet with you for an hour each week, and there can be as many as five pairs in a section. A professor teaching two, 50-minute MWF lecture classes is teaching many more students in the same amount of time. That's probably why no statistics tutorial has been offered in five years - huge enrollments and few professors.

Looking at the course catalog, there were 71 tutorials offered this semester. Some of them were cancelled for lack of interest. The typical tutorial is a high level (300-400 level) humanities or social science class with partners alternating between writing position and response papers. Tutorials in Div III can vary considerably in their form and content.

It is certainly possible to take three or four tutorials during one's time at Williams.",2.0,Quaerendo_Invenietis,,,,,,,,

Also, is there anything that really makes the WEPO unique or is it basically like any other school’s study abroad program?",dz4ee3k,"As someone who has done WEPO recently, it is definitely NOT the only established program at an American college to study abroad at Oxford for a year. I have met students from Tufts, Middlebury, Stanford, and Harvard. Not to mention visiting students from European universities like Sciences Po. Also, with WEPO you can only study at Exeter, and you live with a room mate. To be honest I wish I would have applied to a non-Williams study abroad program to be at Oxford -- like one which would put me in a dorm with other Oxford students rather than 20 minutes away from city centre with a bunch of Williams students. 
Also, the whole idea of ""less competition for STEM spots"" isn't really true. That's not how Oxford works, nor the WEPO program. Basically, you may be more likely to get accepted if the WEPO director can easily find professors or PhD students who will work with you. If you don't care about taking courses in your major, then don't worry. But just FYI -- being a humanities or social sciences (minus most econ courses) student on WEPO is much, much easier, because Oxford students will have completely different knowledge than you in all respects, and therefore in science/math subjects you can expect to be confused or behind if the tutorial is not specifically designed for you/if it's a tutorial with another Oxford student. 
On that note, grades do matter but I had kinda meh grades when I applied, but I was an interesting candidate in other ways -- involved in the school community etc. Just be yourself and be authentic, and of course, do the best you can academically. It's competitive, but so was getting into Williams. ",2.0,trashcan00001,dt523d2,"first, jsyk: most people who go to wepo are humanities-focused. I don't know if this is because the people who apply just tend to be in humanities already or because the interviewers prioritize humanities candidates.

if you ace all your classes you'll have a very good shot, but again I'm not sure what the bias is towards accepting humanities candidates.

wepo's unique for a couple reasons. first, Williams has (I believe) the only established program in the world to study abroad at any Oxford college. second: the classes are tutorials, so you're meeting with a professor one-on-one every week (and there isn't much/any lecture). there tends to be a lot of work (both reading and writing). I'm not sure how this translates to stem tutorials, but I expect you'd be reading journals and doing research.

tbh I wouldn't commit too hard to it or make it your reason to come here (unless you have some very compelling reason to *need* to go to Oxford). if you do decide to this is the place for you, I'd shelve the idea and reevaluate when it comes time to apply for it. just my 2¢",1.0,ar-pharazon,,,,

Imagine being thrown into a microcosm of a college campus where the range of household income is definitely skewed higher than the United States as a whole. It will intensify the issue. If at least 50% of your class can afford to shell out $40-50 on a dinner at Sushi Thai and you're scrimping to make sure you can have school supplies and money for emergencies, you will feel alienated even if none of your classmates meant to make you feel that way. You have to say no to a lot of things. But if you're a student from a low-income family, you will feel that anywhere you go in the future.",7.0,purofound_leadah,f88gy67,With that being said Williams does a great job or reducing this divide.

I’m a senior thinking about applying and the school has everything I want. The only downside is the location. One rep from the school told me that the location is almost in the mountains-ish, which sounds nice but idk if I wanna feel secluded every day. I’m from a big city and would like to be at least near a city so I can have stuff to do off campus. For anyone who came from a city to Williamstown, how was the transition? 

What do you students do on the weekends when you’re not studying? Both on and off campus?",f1rmteo,Definitely in the mountains - not mountain-ish,5.0,PhillyPete12,f1sd6zz,"I graduated over 30 years ago, but Williamstown is still in the same location so I guess my thoughts are fairly relevant.

I never felt cut off from the world, but I grew up in a rural setting and love outdoor activities.  I can see how someone from a city could see it as pretty isolated though.  The closest major cities (NYC and Boston) are 3 hours away.  The closest cities (north Adams and Pittsfield) didn’t have much to offer.  

If you’re looking for an urban experience, Williams is probably not the place for you.

That said, I think most colleges are pretty insular.  I worked briefly at university of Pennsylvania, and despite being in a major city the undergrads lived in a bubble.  

Good luck - I’m sure you’ll do fine wherever you choose.",2.0,PhillyPete12,f1xl3c9,"I actually lived in both big city and suburban area before Williams, but Williams was the most rural I've been at the time of matriculation. That said, I was actually seeking to go to college in a rural campus, because there's a lot of things you can learn from living in a rural area, and 3-4 years is not a huge commitment to one environment. I really treasured the smallness of the campus, being able to experience nature, the closeness you can develop with the community. I wanted to experience the ""college campus culture"" during undergrad and it was what I got (minus Greek system, but I didn't really care for that in the first place). 

It was quite difficult sometimes, especially with food (I'm also a POC from an immigrant family) and holidays. However, my weekends were filled with studying, extracurricular activities, exploring, cultural events, catching up with friends, and just kind of basic get-life-together activities I fell behind on during the week. At the time, my family lived close to NYC area, but I only went back home during breaks because I was so busy with school. 

I know some people who hated being in a secluded rural area. Most of them transferred out, but some settled for getting a car on campus and making trips down to NYC almost every weekend. That options seemed a little bit extreme to me, but people got by. That said, if being secluded is an absolute dealbreaker for you, it's probably best not to apply to a school like Williams, where it's very difficult to even find transportation to go off campus. If you're really into a specific activity or culture-- being a huge Instagram foodie, for example-- it will also not serve you well to go to Williams.",1.0,purofound_leadah

I know several people who are considering transferring because of how toxic the work culture here is and how damaging it is to the mental wellbeing of the students. Somehow this school costs over 70k a year yet the counseling center and office of accessibility are understaffed.

Additionally, the administration has treats us like actual children. Yes, it is great that with COVID they ensured we did not have an outbreak. However, they put unnecessary measures in place that literally no one supports. For example, there was rumors that someone got roofied a few weeks ago and the school decided that we could only swipe in to our own dorms. And this was at all times.

I took 5 years at Williams and had to leave school for mental health reasons for one year. As you said, they encouraged me to drop out but then they also encouraged me to come back when I was ready. They supported me throughout that journey. Were there some staff and faculty at Wiliams who were unhelpful? absolutely. Were there some that saved my life? Also yes. 

However, Williams is, first and foremost, an institution of higher learning. Its aim is to train the leaders of tomorrow in their various fields. It's not a mental health facility. It's not a hospital. They have on campus counseling, their teachers and staff will help you, but outside a few people at the health center they are not professional therapists and psychologists for the most part. As callous as it sounds, it's really not their job and should not be our expectation of them to help us when our own mental health has deteriorated to that point. They can do the best they can, and I've seen them try to help in many ways, but at a certain point the best option simply is to step away from school and go get some professional help. When that point arrives, there's not much the school can do except recommend a medical leave of absence. 

If you're struggling like this I would recommend continuing to weigh your options carefully. Don't consider the work, or the academic goals, or anything else. Just think about what you need, and whether or not Williams can provide it. For me, I got to a point where there was nothing left they could do, so I had to leave. I hope you can find a way without that, but if not just know that that's fine! you can take your time. 

Good luck, hope things turn around for you.",11.0,None,,,,
