ptxa1h,"Beyond their first two semesters, BYU undergraduate, single students will no longer be required to live in BYU On-Campus or BYU Off-Campus Contracted Housing",536,https://och.byu.edu/student-letter,131,2021-09-23 15:09:04+00:00,U8oL0,,hdz15he,Byu finally listened to their economics professors about rent control lol. Big win for students,132.0,michiganpatriot32,hdz1sxi,RIP Redstone management and all the other property management companies that had a monopoly,119.0,sarlacc98,hdz6ra0,"Interesting. I see a couple other noteworthy changes in here not being mentioned:

1. Institute no longer qualifies one to live in BYU housing. This means that neither UVU students nor recent graduates are allowed to live in BYU contracted off-campus housing.
2. BYU students with more than two semesters still *can* live in contracted off-campus housing, but the implication of ""limited space"" is that contractors are required to give preference to newer students.

I strongly suspect this will not affect rent prices as much as people here think it will. Yes, you now have more options, but Redstone, Aspen Ridge, Continental, and all the other property management companies still own most of the properties in the area. True, they won't have a captive market in the sense that students have to live in approved housing, but they also no longer have to follow off-campus housing regulations. Here are some things I would expect to see from the scummier management companies:

1. Expect to see rent stay about the same but with the addition of a monthly fee for apartment furnishings.
2. Crappy properties near the university (especially south of campus) that have previously been forced to provide some basic maintenance in order to keep their contracted housing status will probably get crappier.

Some other consequences I would expect to see in the immediate future:

1. Parking will become even more competitive. With more students choosing to live in Orem, Springville, and other parts of Provo to get cheaper rent, more students will have to commute to school. I'd find some carpool buddies or take advantage of the fact that your student ID doubles as a bus pass.
2. There will be a significant reshuffling of YSA stake and ward boundaries. With less contracted housing necessary, apartments will begin retooling themselves to offer spots to families, older single adults, and non-members. YSA wards near the university will stay much the same, but those a little further out will become somewhat more spread out (now it'll be a city block instead of a single apartment complex). Much further from the university, YSA wards will become more compact as students begin renting homes or apartments previously occupied by families and older adults.
3. There will be a very strong change in the culture for YSA wards. Contracted housing will comprise mostly of younger students, and off-campus, non-contracted housing will be mostly older students.",81.0,geekusprimus

The committee on race made, along with their other recommendations, a recommendation to review campus policies which may disproportionately affect people of different races. This plays into removing the beard rule for two reasons: 

1) pseudofolliculitis, the primary reason you can qualify for a beard card, primarily affects black people (upwards of 60% of black men according to a brief internet search), meaning they have to go through the painful process of getting a beard card at much higher rates (and they have to pay for it).

2) some races have thicker facial hair than others. I'm of Irish/English descent, and when I shave it takes around two days for my 5 o'clock shadow to really become noticeable due to my light hair color. On the other hand, I have friends of Italian/Middle Eastern descent who have super thick, coarse, dark facial hair. They would look like they haven't shaved for 3 days if they waxed their face.

Everyone knows BYU housing has problems, but it’s time we have a real discussion about the root causes.

Here are a few excerpts from “The Provo Housing Racket” that summarize our findings pretty succinctly:

—

Too often, BYU students are over-charged, abused, and taken advantage of by their landlords. And, despite good intentions, BYU is one of the greatest culprits behind Provo’s broken student housing market.

BYU places significant hurdles in the way of would-be landlords, limiting the supply of available housing and costing students more. First, BYU contracted apartments are required to physically segregate male and female designated units. Since most apartments in the U.S. are gender-neutral by default, a large chunk of housing is written-off on that basis alone. Second, BYU contracted apartments must be located within a certain distance of campus, limiting the geography for BYU housing to a mere 2.7 square miles. That area includes established businesses and married housing, as well as streets and greenspace.

As a result, many BYU apartments are thirty, forty, even fifty years old. Building new is expensive, and the pool of non-BYU contracted housing within the zone is limited. Most newer developments are on the premium side of the market (The Village, College Place, etc.). If students had a wider range of affordable options to choose from, rent would fall and quality would rise.

It’s bad enough that BYU has built a system primed for exploitation—a system where the rules of supply and demand no longer apply, and landlords can count on a captive audience of vulnerable renters. What’s worse is the way that BYU has abandoned its responsibility to protect students. Last winter, BYU moved classes online and told students to go home. Students on-campus were released from their contracts in the dorms without penalties. Students off-campus, however, were left to fend for themselves. BYU did little to pressure complexes to release students from contracts, even though the university could have threatened to rescind BYU approval for non-compliant housing. 

If BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing with all of the drawbacks that entails—special rules, higher rents, lower quality—BYU needs to do more to protect students. This means:

No more 12-month contracts: require complexes to offer fall/winter contracts since most students leave Provo in April. 

No more monopolies: limit the reach of companies like Redstone Residential that exercise unfair control over the housing market.

Finally, pick sides: when crises like COVID-19 break out, BYU needs to side with students. The university has played neutral for far too long.

Or better yet, BYU should let students live where they want and let the problems work themselves out.",gcnnlk3,"My former roommates and I once compiled a list of our off campus housing manager’s contract violations, submitted them to the BYU Off-Campus Housing office, and were then told by the person in charge we should just hope to “marry rich someday so we never have to rent again.”",76.0,smileandlaugh,gcnsdx6,The downvotes must be from BYU approved landlords,66.0,spelcheckmaster,gcnnf86,"Honestly, amen.

raok2y,"Aptive Summer Sales, Pest Control Sales Don't Do it Rookies!!!!",173,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/raok2y/aptive_summer_sales_pest_control_sales_dont_do_it/,137,2021-12-07 02:37:23+00:00,None,"If you're thinking about selling **Door-to-Door pest control** or someone is trying to recruit you, **DON'T** do it, this is from personal experience and will tell you the secrets no one else will.



First of all I've done this previously now and if you are like most rookies you will NOT make the money they tell you, you will make. Remember these guys are salesman and will really persuade you to give it a try and not listen to others who are viewing as a negative experience.




The way it works is you sell pest control contracts d2d (door to door) they are usually for 1-year and will average a contract value of for example $520. You as a salesman will get a % and usually they start rookies out at 25% (which is terrible by the way) so that's $130 in commissions per sale you will make. The recruiter will sell you this idea you can make $20,000, $40,000, $100,000 in one summer. **Reality is 99% will NOT.** It's a very hard industry you are knocking door to door 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.



Now that I get out of the way how it works, Let me show you the realty of it and not only MY experience but experience with other friends and coworkers and how we all get screwed and YOU will too.



So they will most likely give you a % of 25%, 30% or maybe even a little higher. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't sell and service over 100 accounts or sometimes even 150 accounts you will get a low flat percentage of 18%. This will cost you thousands of dollars. For example if you go out and work your butt off and you finish the summer with 95 accounts serviced. ($520x95accounts = $49,400(18%) you are only making $8,892 this is not including rent, groceries, gas, entertainment, etc. so you will make a LOT less than you would staying home with your parents working for $8-$15/hour. Since they prey on college students or returned missionaries from the LDS church.That is ONLY ONE WAY they will try and screw you over.



Another way is if you do happen to go against their favor and you do service over 100 or 150 accounts I've had friends I worked with who didn't even get their commission checks. So the way it works is during the summer you will get only $50 upfront for each serviced accounts and the rest of the commission you will get in the ""backend"" (rest of commission checks later in the year, 2 of them) which usually payout a few months later in November, and January. I've had friends who are out there busting all hot summer for 3-4 months to end up not getting anything. There recruiter will lie and say some of there accounts canceled and it fell below the 150 or 100 accounts serviced. To put in perspective let's say you sold and serviced 150 accounts and you get your $50 for each one ($50x150= $7,500 during the summer) with expectations you are going to get a $15,900 after the summer only to come to find out your recruiter kept all your money then will lie to you that some of your accounts weren't legit or they canceled. Keeping $15,900 of your earned money.

**I had a friend who sold and serviced 198 accounts..** and signed a 35% commission plan, which would of been like $36,000+ he would made (since I don't remember his average contract value) **he ended making only $9,900** ($50 upfront per sale x 198accounts = $9,900) and his recruiter would end up keeping $41,100+ (I figured this since if he only got paid it $9,900 that would be only 10% since he didn't get his backend checks. Since the recruiter can recruit someone and give them a commission deal the recruiter will make the difference of 50%, for example 50%-10%(whatever number they sign a recruit at) = 40% recruiter keeps) we will say he averaged a contract value of $520 x 198accounts = $102,960 revenue (40% recruiter keeps if they screw you over) Recruiter keeps $41,000 and this is how they make their money my screwing over multiple recruits and obviously wanting a couple of them to succeed because they will make override commissions of that recruit but also any recruits they bring on to the team the following summers, almost like a pyramid.


**DON'T sell door-to-door pest control**, 99% of the time they will screw you over. They are not in the industry to make it into a career, they are in it to recruit and have unexperienced and uneducated first year reps make their money year after year. Please spread the word and share this post with people who are thinking about doing it. This is how your recruiter is able to afford all the stuff they are showing off to you. (cars, trucks, clothes, gadgets, toys, lifestyle, travelling, etc.) You will be working 12 hour days, 6 days a week to make money for their pockets and since you're a 1099 ""employee"" that signed some pathetic agreement they can get away with this. You should really avoid any sales recruiter If you have any questions comment below or message me. I got screenshots of my previous agreement commission plan and screenshots how I got screwed over and I sold over the 150 amount.  


If you have any experiences similar or know of anyone who this happened to post below. Let's make it aware for others before going out and wasting their summer since some of us have tuition bills to pay, families to support, etc.

**To add:** Aptive and it’s recruiters/team leaders really do be trying to set you up for failure or set the odds against you however you want to look at it. Because they have control on what they put down on the agreement you sign for example.

- 18% if you don’t service over 150 accounts
- 18% if you switch to a technician (but in reality you won’t get any of it)
- they keep ALL your money if you leave home early (over 60% of reps do)
- if you don’t service a minimum of 6 accounts/week you will get written up then fired if it happens again, resulting in your recruiter keeping ALL your money (recruiters will say this is in both our best interest because we don’t want you to be out here if you’re not selling, but just imagine if you have to take a few days off for a wedding or you get sick.. lol)
- if you go home even a day early from the dates you told them on paper, written you are voiding your contract and they can keep all your money. Even if they say “talk to us and we’re understanding” don’t believe it, only what’s in writing actually is true. Had it happen to a buddy who went home only 2 days early from his end date and kept ALL his money..


Still think I’m only talking about my experience and a personal few other people I know, or maybe that I’m not a good sales rep? Lol If you got time read this:

But most of them are unique to Aptive. They’re definitely the slimiest pest company. I complained about all the same things and then tried another company and had a much more positive experience.

Since transferring isn't really an option for me, I plan on being more open with my gender identity at BYU, and I've already came out to my bishop and a number of professors. Everyone has been pretty supportive so far, which I was not expecting.

Anyway, I wanted to get my ID card updated to reflect my new name and gender presentation. I was a bit hesitant, since I've heard quite a few cautionary tales of LGBT students and the Honor Code Office. I ended up emailing the ID center to verify that what I was doing was kosher.

It turns out that the ID center was totally cool with putting my preferred name on my card and dressing in feminine clothing for my picture. The person I emailed even asked what pronouns I wanted used for me so that when I went in I wouldn't get misgendered. So that turned out really well. Getting the ID card updated was pretty easy too, I simply walked in, took the picture, got my card, and left no questions asked.

In summary, while BYU can still be a tricky place for LGBT students to navigate, things are getting much better for us on campus. If you're a transgender student on campus, you should definitely still weigh the pros and cons of coming out of the closet. I just want y'all to know that (in my experience) the ID center is pretty trans friendly.",f1se0r0,"I got a new ID in October 2017.

em3vln,My experience meeting with an Associate Dean of Students about the beard policy,134,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/em3vln/my_experience_meeting_with_an_associate_dean_of/,19,2020-01-09 03:26:15+00:00,None,"Hey everyone, I'm a sophomore at BYU who thinks he looks way better with a beard, and my wife and friends agree. So I let my facial hair grow and shave before tests. I hate doing this, because I want to let my beard grow out, so a couple weeks ago I met with the Associate Dean of Students Nathan Ward to discuss the issue of beards.

A quick summary of our meeting: that sucks, there's nothing I or you can do, have an ice cream on us.

In all honesty, my meeting with Dean Ward was very cordial and respectful. I went in knowing that people would have spoken with him before and intended on getting some ideas on official ways I can go about appealing it to people in power. And that's where I hit a brick wall. While I got the feeling throughout the meeting that Dean Ward was on my side and in total agreement, he explained to me in no uncertain terms that there's no way for me to directly contact those in charge of the Dress and Grooming Standards.

He also explained to me who's in charge of them: the First Presidency, Twelve, and a handful of other commissioners who meet to talk about the entire CES once a month. He told me that they were aware of the issues and that they were aware that student sentiment had changed. I asked if he could bring it up, he said that while they do talk about student sentiment about many rules that not even President Worthen can make recommendations on changes to the Honor Code: only the board can ask for recommendations. ie the prophet, his counselors, and 3 or 4 other people. The last time they asked for recommendations? 1991.

I asked him if he could see the policy changing while I'm at BYU (two-ish more years), he said he wouldn't be surprised, but that I shouldn't hold my breath.

After 45 minutes of discussion, I said ""it appears we've hit a brick wall."" Dean Ward chuckled sympathetically, and as a well-intentioned final act of placation, gave me two coupons for free ice cream from Cougar Eats, which I enjoyed with my wife.

EDIT: here's a follow up on my experience writing President Worthen himself:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/ex2jse/follow\_up\_to\_my\_previous\_post\_about\_the\_beard/](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/ex2jse/follow_up_to_my_previous_post_about_the_beard/)",fdm6ma4,This was a wholesome read.

If you’re studying away from campus, there’s no way to escape this. 

Additionally, according to the [faq](https://www.byustore.com/student-first), this will continue every year starting with the freshman class so that by 2023 every BYU student will be forced into this program. 

I’m going to be contacting the bookstore and STRONGLY ask them to discontinue this. I plead with everyone who sees this to do the same. Start a petition, call, or write the administration.

And to all incoming freshman, the bookstore should be your last resort, not your first option. You can find textbooks online for only 20%-30% of the bookstore’s selling price most of the time. I can’t remember a time when I actually bought a book from the bookstore after my first semester at byu.

Edit: u/mspixton pointed out that the person to email is mark_clegg@byu.edu

ixr7gs,Warning from Worthen and UVU President,109,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/ixr7gs/warning_from_worthen_and_uvu_president/,91,2020-09-22 16:47:51+00:00,None,"Dear Students,

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah, we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County, particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We’re concerned not only for your well-being, but also for those in the local community who are affected by the trends we’ve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes, work, church, and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren’t wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you’re feeling sick, stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus, may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result, follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks, more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine, closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely,

Kevin J Worthen, BYU President

View Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jw291e/the_problems_with_byu_contracted_housing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

In Part 1, we concluded that one of the biggest drivers behind BYU's broken student housing market is BYU itself. In Part 2, we will examine Redstone Residential and MHE Real Estate as a case study on the greater Provo student housing market. 

\_\_\_

Most students have no idea who their actual landlord is, and unmasking owners can be a lot like taking apart a Russian Nesting Doll—one shell company after another. Consider the Liberty franchise. According to Utah business records, the Liberty on Freedom complex is owned by Liberty on Freedom (LLC). In turn, Liberty on Freedom (LLC) is owned by Liberty Square West Investors (LLC) and Liberty Square West (LLC). Finally, Liberty Square West (LLC) is managed by **(name redacted to avoid doxxing)**, CEO of MHE Real Estate. A quick look through the MHE Real Estate [website](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/) reveals that MHE is a major player in the Provo housing market, despite the fact that the average renter has never even heard of them.

MHE at least partially owns: Campus Provo, Liberty Square, Liberty on Eighth, and Liberty on Freedom. These are among the largest BYU complexes by bed count. Liberty Square is actually the single largest BYU complex by bed count. 

While MHE owns the apartments, Redstone Residential (a real estate operating company) manages everything from leasing to maintenance and rent collections. In other words: Redstone is essentially a middleman between landlords and renters. Most operating companies take a percentage of revenues, driving up rent and disincentivizing any expensive maintenance or improvements. 

Residents we spoke to at Liberty on Freedom noted aged buildings, shared bedrooms, cramped kitchens, and a single shared bathroom. With utilities, rent comes out to about $400/month.

Before MHE and Redstone, Liberty Square had a vacancy rate of [30-40%](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/liberty-square/) during the summer months due to the nature of fall/winter and spring/summer length contracts. Now, Redstone-managed properties almost exclusively offer 12-month contracts, and vacancy has fallen to nearly zero. The burden has shifted from landlords to renters, and students are left scrambling to find replacement tenants for the summer months even though most BYU students leave Provo in April.

Redstone manages about half of all beds at the large BYU complexes and an even greater share of the overall market. Because BYU has kept the barrier to entry for new landlords so high, many students are forced to choose between one Redstone-managed property or another. And if it's not Redstone, it's likely Aspen Ridge. Small landlords are struggling to compete or even get BYU approval.

When COVID hit, the MHE-owned and Redstone-operated Liberty franchise was generally uncooperative with students trying to be released from their contracts or get rent reductions. Meanwhile, Redstone Residential received [between $2-5m](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/redstone-residential-inc-3cfaf714208b0bbd8de93d67b90a1a92) in forgivable PPP loans. 

When a few large firms monopolize a market, competition falls and consumers are made worse-off. Granting students access to the open market is the best way to promote competition and loosen the hold of companies like Redstone and MHE.

It's time for BYU to step-up and fix the broken housing market they helped create.",gcv0um4,"This is the review I left for omni apartments, which is owned by red stone:

NEVER LIVE HERE OR ANY REDSTONE MANAGED COMPLEX!!!! This review is as of 10/23/2020. The management is awful. Just in the last two months I’ve lived here I’ve never had as bad of an experience at an apartment than I have now. As of this morning, they booted at least 20 people’s cars after zero notice. No email or anything. I called and texted with no answer. Finally went by the office and they said they did “everything they could” to give us notice, which was nothing. Not even exaggerating.

Also, our toilet was broken when we got here and was constantly running, and pouring out water. Many, many attempts to reach the management both in person and virtually resulted in absolutely nothing. After a month of this, our bill was an extra $40 for just water. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!

Also don’t even try to contact them, I’ve tried email, text, phone call and in person, and have only seen them once. That was today lol.

***edit: I woke up early to get the boot off my car and it already got towed 🙃. What kind of management tows their own tenants (and a student at that) car after no notice?",27.0,averagesizechungus,gcuyil6,"Oh, let me share a story about my time at the Rivera (2 years ago) who is ~~owned~~ *managed* by Redstone Residential. My thoughts at the time of the events are in italics.

My year-long contract there was hell. Don't get me wrong, I loved my roommates and the ward but the management was shady on a good day. Every month we had a cleaning check, whatever I usually had the kitchen to clean as my job. I scrubbed the hell out of that thing every month and I failed at least 6 of the 12 cleaning checks during the year. They looked for any reason to fail you. Funny thing is, they never told you what it was that you failed for. So when the recheck happens like a few days later, they would fail me again and charge me an extra $35 for a ""cleaning"" crew to come. I stuck around all day twice for the ""cleaning crew"" to come. Once it was the main office staff and they cleaned nothing, the second no one showed up. I could have sworn the checkers were paid per fail they gave to cleaning checks with how fail-happy they were.

My final month comes around and I ask the front office if I have to pay my last month's rent and they confidently say ""Yes!"". I wasn't sure if I paid last month's rent in the deposit or not so I asked them to check and they said, No you have to pay last month's rent. So I write the check and didn't think to make sure until a few days later when I checked the contract. I asked for the money back and of course, I had to jump through 1000 hoops to get my damn money back.

And after leaving my miserable experience didn't stop. You know that all-important deposit that complexes force out of you and tell you a certain amount is ""refundable""? Yeah, good luck prying that from their greedy hands when it's time to leave. Final check day came, I left the stupid addressed envelope, stamp, etc. that they ""need"" (otherwise they charge you $3 for it! lol).  About two months pass and I still haven't seen the refundable part of my deposit. So I call the Rivera. They tell me ""Oh, there was an issue with the printer here and YOURS didn't get printed"" (*wonder how many other people's checks ""didn't get printed""*). So they told me to wait a few days, I waited, no one called me back. So I called them, they said they still are having printer issues, (*yeah sure you are*). So they tell me to call/email Redstone about the issue. So I email Redstone Residential and get into a bit of an email battle with the secretary. I wrote her saying that I still hadn't gotten my refunded deposit back, oh, and that last month's rent I paid but I didn't need to. So after almost a week she finally tells me that she will get on it but that she will deduct $50 because I ""failed the final cleaning check"" (*oh WOW, you don't say! /s*). I finally convinced her to give me that damn $50 because they had already gotten $100+ from me during the freaking school year. Then the best part, she also tells me that they are having ""printer issues"" and that I need to come down to the main office to pick up my check. You would think that with the amount of money they took from me for cleaning checks they could fix their damn printers! (*Imagine if I lived outside of the Provo/Orem area during the summer...*) Finally got my money... after 3 months of lots of pestering them.

TLDR;

I was forced to pay a stupid amount of money for monthly cleaning checks that felt like a coin toss. Redstone Residential and other property management companies attempt to swindle any money they can out of the residents. When it came time to uphold their end of the contract and return my refundable portion of the deposit, they looked for any reason to not return the money or keep as much of it as possible.",20.0,Cholojuanito,gcv8oz9,"The way I see it is this:

In the early 2010s when Redstone was founded they recognized the potential to essentially corner the housing market in Provo. Independent complex owners were getting older and looking to cash out and move on with their grandkids etc. They probably got some venture capital and started buying up complexes and houses as they went up for sale. 

What happened next was some pretty impressive growth. From what I could find, in 2013 they were managing 1,300 beds. Now in 2020 they are in the 20,000s. They look like the future of Provo housing, and in my opinion that future is going up--in the quite literal sense. Land is becoming more scarce, I bet that in the next couple years we will see a lot more homes and entire blocks bought out south of campus and big complexes built there.",15.0,butt-hole-eyes

Pro-tip: This is not the first time groups of people with different standards have had conflict.  So what’s the best way to deal with conflict?  Generally, when there is deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement, it’s helpful to agree to disagree.  

By the way, “deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement” is exactly what this is.  This isn’t Handmaid’s-Tale-style patriarchy trying to oppress you, and it’s not a progressive conspiracy to make you gay.  It’s decent people who genuinely hold one set of values disagreeing with decent people who hold a different set of values.  For the most part.

I have many friends and acquaintances from across the political and social spectrum, and we agree to disagree a lot.  I don’t love the fact that abortions occur, but I have good friends who are one-issue pro-choice voters.  I don’t think Islam is the devil’s scourge, but I go to family reunions with plenty of people who do think that, and I love them dearly.  I think socialism is an atrocious idea, but I haven’t blocked any of my Bernie-loving friends on social media.  Why?  Because we agree to disagree.  We share our opinions, we exchange ideas, and when the day is over, we shake hands and go back to our corners.

By the way, letting the other side “go back to their corner” is an essential part of agreeing to disagree.  Even though I’m pro-life, I’ve never chased an abortion doctor back to his house and picketed his front door.  Because that’s his house.  Even though I’m anti-anti-Islam, I’ve never gone inside my cousin’s rural Baptist church and shouted that everyone needs to stop sending money to Israel and be more open-minded about Islam.  Because that’s their church.  Even though I’m pro-gun, I’ve never gone to a meeting of Moms Demand Action with a firearm slung on my shoulder.  Because that’s their meeting.  Agreeing to disagree means you listen quietly, you state your case, and then you respect the other side’s autonomy.

In summary --  Even if you think homosexuality is a bad idea, don’t go to a gay bar and preach at people.  Nobody forced you to go to the gay bar, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave the people in the gar bar alone.  The gar bar doesn’t exist for you.  And even if you think homosexuality is just fine, don’t go to BYU and protest.  Nobody forced you to go to BYU, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave BYU alone.  There are plenty of universities that don’t think there is anything at all wrong with homosexuality.  Like, ALL OF THEM except BYU.  

I’m NOT saying, “If you don’t like BYU's standards, go somewhere else.”  I’m saying, if you don’t like BYU’s stance on homosexuality, that’s fine!  Stay if you want to.  It’s fine that there are communities that you don’t like.  There are communities that I don’t like.  We don’t have to change everybody we disagree with.  Let BYU’s standards be BYU’s standards.

Respect the fact that different communities see things differently, and leave them alone to do things differently.",fjlk9sa,"Meh I'll hold your feet to the fire on this one. 

Im of the opinion that it's never an all or nothing. I can choose to work for a company but push leadership for better hours or work culture. I can move to a state that is pro-abortion and still protest abortion. I can go to a school and pushback on their policy on major selection, travel grants, beards, or homosexuality. Sure many people don't but I've got mad respect for those that do.

I think the greatest changes have come from people that are passionate about things and willing to bring it to places or people that aren't.

I was a convert with a 36 and a 4.0 and I was left feeling shocked and very hurt. I attended another university for a semester, reapplied with the exact same application, and was ultimately accepted for Winter 2019. 

College admissions is a really fickle process. I don't know why you were denied (and if my experience holds, you will never receive a reason...) but I do have a firm belief—bolstered in large part by my rejection experience—that God will aid us in making the best of these twists and bumps in our life plans. I'm sure I could be in a fantastic place in my life right now had I been accepted the first time, but I also know that my life would be drastically different without the attributes I refined as I weathered this ""trial,"" the amazing friends and faculty with whom I connected at my other university, and the people I met here at BYU only because I arrived when and how I did.

Unfollow BYU on Instagram for a few months if you have to, but keep doing all of the wonderful things you did in preparation to gain admittance and striving to be the best person you can be.

I know, feel free to burn me alive. I worked my tail off to try to change this about print and mail. A few things made this hard:

The supervisor of my supervisor was cheap. They didn’t buy us new printers often and had us (n00bz) repair old ones and try them out before getting new ones. And often the new ones came from BYU surplus used and we still had to repair them. 

There are 4 people on the team and they’re in charge of all tech support for the BYU Print and Mail building PLUS these printers PLUS most of the print service desks located on campus. It’s a hellish workload.

Printers literally suck as a technology. It’s a cliche in movies to have issues with thw office printer because they seriously just SUCK. 

BYU has a contract for harder repairs, troubleshooting, and maintenance to be done by a KonicaMinolta tech who has to travel through all of southern and central Utah. They won’t give us another tech because we don’t own enough printers or something (I can’t really remember why, it’s been five years). 

Rest assured though, that I tried so hard to fix these problems. I streamlined our ticketing system, made submitting student tickets possible, threw out a ton of old print stations nobody used to decrease our load, and vouched for putting brand new printers in. I spent a summer troubleshooting problems with those new printers and there were STILL issues with them once the semester started. Printers seriously SUCK and so do idiot students like me with only on the job training.

I still shake my fist when I go to print and end up wandering through three buildings to find one that works. Some of those printers are absolutely haunted.

Despite following all of BYU's mask and social distancing standards both on- and off-campus, I developed some COVID-like symptoms over the weekend. Per the instructions at [health.byu.edu](https://health.byu.edu) and on the Health Together app, I started self-isolating right away and I called the BYU COVID-19 hotline (801-310-0438). Since it was the weekend, they weren't open, so I left a message and received a call back first thing this morning.

You have to have an appointment to be tested at BYU. When they called me, they gave me several timeframe options during the day. You can either walk up or drive through. Masks are required. I walked since I don't have a car. When I was there this morning, it already seemed pretty busy with a few other people who walked up and 10-15 cars in line waiting to be tested. The whole process took me 5-10 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I left.

There is a tent at the front of the Student Health Center where you give them your name to check in. They took my temperature, and after waiting for a few minutes, one of the doctors administered the test. Yes, it involves sticking a q-tip type thing far up your nose, but at least for me, it wasn't painful and just tickled. They told me I should expect to get a phone call with the test results on Wednesday.

I'd imagine things will only get busier as the semester continues, so it's probably best to be proactive about getting tested even if you start experiencing even the slightest symptoms. I hope everybody stays safe!",g3hut3j,"Yes thanks for the info.

I've been at BYU for the past 6 years earning my BS and MS. I was supposed to continue on and do a PhD, but instead I'm leaving academia to work full-time. Why? Because I lost my faith.

I won't go into details about why I'm leaving the church, but let me assure you it was a painful journey and one that I did not choose. I learned some things that fundamentally changed my understanding of the church, and after a year of praying and studying and hoping I realized I could never go back to feeling the way I once did about Joseph Smith or the current church leadership. I have no hard feelings towards the members I've known and loved throughout my life, but Mormonism just isn't for me anymore.

The hardest part of leaving the church has been deciding to leave BYU, as that has permanantly changed my career trajectory. I would absolutely stay here if I felt like I could. I'd be happy to quietly resign from the church and continue living the honor code, but as per the university's Student Standing Policy ([https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy)) that would disqualify me from an ecclesiastical endorsement. I could fake being active to keep my ecclesiastical endorsement, but I'm not willing to submit myself to that bishop's roulette game any longer than I already have. I feel like I've been forced out of my community because of something outside of my control.

In the past few years I have contributed a lot to this university. I've helped hundreds of students as a TA. I've led research projects that have brought recognition and funding to my department. I've mentored almost every new research assistant that has entered my advisor's lab. I've taught classes and presented published research at conferences. And I would have continued to do the same things for the next three+ years if BYU let me. I believe this school would have been better off with me than without me.

I'm not particularly angry about the situation. I'm going to a great job, and now that I've made my decision I'm excited for the change. But I really feel that by forcing people like me out - people who unwillingly lose their faith - BYU is shooting itself in the foot. Sure, there is a risk that former members might actively detract from the spiritual beliefs of their classmates, but BYU already has other policies in place to prevent that. I hope they reconsider their policy and start treating former church members the same as other non-members. 

The stated goal of the Honor Code is to encourage campus community members to ""conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and...to maintain the highest standards in their personal conduct regarding honor, integrity, morality, and consideration of others"". I believe I can do that outside of the church just as easily as I did it in the church. In fact, it is my honor and integrity that demands I leave the church, and it's my consideration to others that demands I not work to actively lead others out of it.

I'll miss being part of this community, and I think that this community will miss me.",hol1rv1,I think it's morally inconsistent to accept members of every single religion unless they are specifically former LDS members.,70.0,throwaway_86209,hokn6af,Perhaps it is a blessing in disguise. Getting all of your degrees from the same institution is often considered a hindrance academically as it only exposes you to one institutions pedagogy and philosophy.

I think this change is less about the students living south of campus but in preparation for Sophomores and older getting to live wherever they want which means an influx of cars and not enough parking at BYU so the streets south of campus will be filled with student cars.   


Still not great. However, if we could encourage more people to use public transit instead of driving to park close to campus we could cut down on the emissions that add to the inversion.

The presenters said that the honor code first began as a grassroots effort, initiated by the student body, to promote a higher moral standard of conduct amongst the students living on campus. However, as I have progressed through my time at BYU, I am not sure if I have ever encountered any student who particularly likes the honor code. At least every student I've met seems to think that some aspects of the honor code need to be altered if not discarded altogether. 

While the honor code may have represented a grassroots student movement from the class of 1948 (when the honor code was endorsed), it no longer seems to represent the values or opinions of the student body. For that reason, it seems somewhat facetious to pitch the honor code to new students as a body of stipulations that is presently accepted by the student body.

I am curious to hear other opinions though. What are your thoughts on the honor code? Do you perceive that the majority of students like it or dislike it? Do you feel like it is time to implement any changes? If so, of what sort?",gxxnlg8,"I think the vast majority of students support *an* Honor Code, but the Honor Code as it stands needs a lot of fixes.

You'd think Raintree would do everything in their power to stop this kind of thing from happening and to get you your car back, but they probably won't.

Plus, they know their residents can't afford the time or cost of resolving this legally, despite this being totally illegal. The predatory towing company is relying on the fact that you need your car now to keep your job, and you'll probably pay up.

At the same time, I don't think it's unreasonable to expect BYU students to have different standards than at other universities. 

I think the biggest problem lies in the fact that the HCO steps in on matters of *sin*, not just university misconduct. And without the calling and mantle that Bishops have, they mandate things that interfere with or overshadow some of the fundamental precepts of the gospel (the atonement/repentance process). 

I think it makes sense to leave the matters of eternal importance to Bishops (with keys and callings), let the police handle illegal matters (sexual assault, theft, drug abuse), and keep the more university policy stuff with the HCO (plagiarism, academic dishonesty, etc).

Anyways, I’ve seen a lot of people share online President Worthen’s letter about COVID spread at BYU. From what I understood, even small group gatherings outside of class and church are discouraged.

qk3jtp,Advice about church attendance,68,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/qk3jtp/advice_about_church_attendance/,35,2021-11-01 01:36:48+00:00,None,"I want to start off by saying I love this university and I truly value the experience I am having here. It’s a great institution and I feel privileged to be here.

My main concern is that I virtually have no desire to attend church anymore. Ever since my mission my testimony has steadily declined and now I’m not sure I really believe anymore. When I attend church services I feel empty and disingenuous. I don’t want to transfer schools because I worked so hard to get here and I love it here. But I’m worried about the honor code since I don’t attend down here. My family lives an hour away so I enjoy spending weekends with them when I can. I occasionally attend church with them. 

I really want to be a good person and serve others. I want to minister to others and help bring about Zion. I figure the church is a great way to do that, but each time I attend I leave feeling sadder and more discouraged.

I still pay my tithing diligently so I’m not free-loading (as much) on my subsidized tuition. Does anyone have any advice or insight?

EDIT: just to clarify, I am living every other aspect of the honor code. I feel sad and discouraged because my participation in the church for the most part has been to placate my parents (they have sacrificed a lot for me and my inactivity would make them feel like they have failed or that I am rebelling against them). This brings me sadness at church because I feel that on some level I’ll probably never have that child-like faith again and that now I’m attending for the wrong reasons.",hiugwzy,"My advice is to spend some time pondering and praying about three things: your testimony of Christ, your testimony of the COJCOLDS, and your testimony of your Ward. When I was closer to your age, I was prone to feeling that if Jesus was real, then my home teachers ought to actually care about me, and that if my Sunday School teacher taught a good lesson that must mean the atonement is real. I don't believe either of those things. I'm all for giving people as much grace as possible, but sometimes your Ward just sucks. Sometimes people around you are idiots, and sometimes BYU culture makes you want to run away screaming. These things can make it a lot harder to be excited about church, but they're not worth ditching (or joining) a religion over.

As an ""old man"" (comparatively) I like to say that I actually believe fewer things than I used to, but I'm more firmly rooted to Christ. There have been times in life where I've just had to hunker down with that knowledge and wait until I was able to resolve some other things.

Whatever you do, I wish you well. Don't let anyone convince you that your value as a person has anything to do with your activity in the church or what university for attend.",31.0,TomPastey,hiutr0e,"As someone who struggles with church faith and things like that for reasons that are literally out of my own control (I'm part of the LGBTQ community much to the dismay of what feels like every single leader), I've found that it's just best to find some friends that go to that ward and sit with them. Being near people you like makes the whole experience a lot more bearable even if it hurts. It's just a few more years and then you can truly decide for yourself, no strings attached, if this church is truly for you or not. You got this!",28.0,Wifijoe,hivsqnv,"The BYU survival guide ( https://byusurvivalguide.com/ ) is a useful resource for your situation. BYU does not supply any support or resources for students who lose their faith for any reason, so it can be isolating and difficult to keep going, especially when leaving isn't a realistic solution or when trauma is involved.

If you want to regain a testimony, whether in the church or outside it, I'd recommend spending time outside of church discovering what parts of your religious upbringing and beliefs you value, and what kind of person you want to be. 

If the church helps you to live those values and be that person, great! If not, that's great too! The church doesn't have a monopoly on spirituality or truth or goodness. It's okay to find what you need in other places, in other churches or inside yourself. It's not a betrayal of BYU or the church. After all, I figure God would rather you be a good person than just a good member.

And in the meantime, the survival guide has the most complete advice I've found on surviving at BYU during a faith crisis, a situation that requires limited church attendance, or as an ex member. I hope you find it useful.",24.0,Czarcasm2jjb
