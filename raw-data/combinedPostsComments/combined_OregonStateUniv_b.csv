# EMAIL FROM OREGON STATE

11 March 2020

Oregon State University is committed to state, national and global efforts to reduce the risk and spread of COVID-19, while appropriately continuing the essential activities of teaching, research, OSU Extension and engagement. While at this time, the public health risk in Oregon from the coronavirus is lower than it is in other states, we became aware today of a presumptive COVID-19 case in Deschutes County and testing for a possible case in Benton County is underway.

**Effective Saturday, March 14, OSU will move to a higher level of response that continues the essential operations of the university, but seeks to reduce the frequency of interactions among students, faculty, staff and visitors throughout all university campuses, centers, facilities and operations. Our focus is on continued university operations and social distancing.**

In taking these steps, we remain mindful and informed by the public health guidance of our local county health departments, the Oregon Health Authority and the CDC.

**Effective March 14, 2020:**

¬ß  Campuses and OSU facilities and operations statewide will remain open.

¬ß  Winter term finals week exams and activities will be delivered remotely where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

¬ß  University academic and remote meeting tools, including Canvas and Zoom, will be used to minimize in-person meetings.

¬ß  All non-essential OSU-sponsored travel will be suspended.

¬ß  All OSU employees will be encouraged to work remotely where work responsibilities and duties allow.

¬ß  All OSU students, faculty and staff are encouraged to avoid personal travel over spring break. Students should instead consider remaining at our campuses in Corvallis and Bend.

We are taking these immediate steps while OSU employees and students prepare to take expanded public health measures at the start of spring term.

**Effective March 30, 2020:**

¬ß  All of the above actions are maintained.

¬ß  All spring term courses, labs and exams will be delivered remotely, where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

¬ß  Until at least April 30, no non-essential OSU-sponsored events of more than 50 attendees will be permitted. All events with fewer than 50 attendees will be held with maximum social distancing.

**The status of these measures will be evaluated every two weeks.**

We recognize such steps will prompt many questions and cause disruption. We ask for everyone to accommodate these changes, engage in and support appropriate support personal health measures, support as able other OSU community members, and frequently check the university‚Äôs [COVID-19 website](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus) for updated information.

Given that OSU plans that all university operations will remain in effect, we anticipate the continued employment and benefits for all employees. During this time, the university will seek to continue the employment of its student workers.

The following provides additional information regarding important aspects of OSU‚Äôs COVID-19 response.

**SOCIAL DISTANCING:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html) as avoiding crowds and mass public gatherings, and when possible, maintaining a distance of approximately six feet from others. Social distancing also means staying at home when ill, avoiding contact with people who have symptoms of illness, and not shaking hands.

**FINAL EXAMS:** Because OSU will administer final exams using a social distancing model, for those exams that must be held in-person, the university will seek to relocate final exams to locations where room capacity is three times the number of people registered to take that test. Faculty will notify students of changes in finals week logistics.

**REMOTE TEACHING:** Remote teaching delivery is when a faculty member facilitates the delivery of their in-person course instruction from a different location by using tools such as Canvas and Zoom. With the¬†suspension of face-to-face meetings and the requirement for remote teaching, OSU will provide key resources available to faculty, staff and students. These include the following web pages: [Keep Teaching](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-teaching), [Keep Learning](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-learning) and [Keep Working](https://uit.oregonstate.edu/keep-working). If you have any questions or require any technology assistance, please [contact the Service Desk](http://is.oregonstate.edu/help). Additionally, there will be online and telephone resources readily available to help students navigate all aspects of online delivery, including Zoom.

Additional information on remote teaching is available for all students, faculty and staff within the university‚Äôs COVID-19 web page [‚ÄúHot Topics‚Äù under remote teaching.](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus/remote-teaching-learning-and-working-faq)

**SPRING BREAK:** We ask that OSU students, faculty and staff carefully evaluate Spring Break travel plans. If you are a student, please consider staying on campus or simply going home instead of traveling elsewhere during the break. OSU‚Äôs residence halls will remain open during spring break. If you are an employee, please consider remaining within your home community. We realize this may disrupt your plans, but broader travel within the U.S. and abroad brings additional risk of exposure to COVID-19, which includes the possibility of self-isolation upon return.

**EVENTS:** OSU‚Äôs future requirements regarding events is based upon the university‚Äôs interest in reducing the opportunity for COVID-19 to spread among people who gather in large public settings.

OSU recognizes that other universities, colleges, K-12 school districts, the state of Oregon and employers may at some time institute other requirements regarding the number of people in attendance at event. We also recognize that CDC guidance on crowd sizes may be different. In OSU‚Äôs case, university leaders believe that the facilities throughout the university can best accommodate our social distancing goals at a maximum of 50 people within OSU-sponsored events.

Information about the university‚Äôs COVID-19 response involving OSU Athletics events will be updated on Thursday, March 12.

Because COVID-19 remains a rapidly developing situation, it is important to check OSU‚Äôs page regularly, as well as advisories and warnings from the [U.S. Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) prior to finalizing personal travel plans and undertaking travel.

Please utilize OSU‚Äôs dedicated non-emergency COVID-19 information line, which is available to assist faculty, staff and students with questions at 541-737-7211. You can also seek information through the questions and non-emergency contact form on the [COVID-19 website](https://oregonstate.edu/COVID-19). In the case of a medical emergency, call 911 or a nearby emergency medical facility.

The best preventive measures for COVID-19 and any communicable disease continue to be the practices you undertake as part of your daily routine, especially during flu season:

¬ß  Engage in social distancing;

¬ß  Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with warm soapy water or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol;

¬ß  Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with another person‚Äôs saliva, whether in your own living or social environments;

¬ß  Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue; then discard the tissue;

¬ß  Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to support a healthy immune system;

¬ß  If you are not well, remain at home and contact your primary care physician, Student Health Services or a local emergency medical care provider.

During this time of public health concern and changes in OSU‚Äôs operations, please remain mindful and supportive of members of the OSU community who may be more directly affected by the coronavirus situation. Also, it is important that we remain a united community. If you witness any acts of bias or discrimination related to COVID-19, please report them to the [OSU Bias Incident Response](https://diversity.oregonstate.edu/bias-incident-response) team.

Thank you for your understanding and your continued work to keep the OSU community safe and healthy.

Sincerely,

Edward Feser

Provost and Executive Vice President

Had my sense of taste devolved to that of some uncultured monkey, unable to comprehend the complex gustatory nuances of sandwich spreads? For the first day or two I was plagued by such thoughts, fearing I‚Äôd spiraled down into some sandwich induced schizophrenia. It was only when I sought external sources that, upon tasting true chipotle mayo, I reaffirmed my reality. Interestingly, my sandwiches were handled by different people each time. This is clearly not the result of some rogue employee‚Äîthese orders came from above.

## Most OSU Corvallis campus fall instruction to be offered remotely and online

Dear OSU faculty and staff,

We write to announce important decisions regarding instruction for the fall term.

Based on careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU‚Äôs Corvallis campus will deliver most courses remotely in the fall, making it possible for students to live and study from home if that is the best option for them. This approach will limit the density of activity on-campus and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19 among students and employees.

Given OSU-Cascades‚Äô smaller size, the Bend campus will offer a higher complement of fall courses on-site, while also creating remote learning options so that OSU-Cascades students also have a choice of where to live and study. A separate communication that provides information on fall instruction at OSU-Cascades is [available here](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/speeches-and-statements/osu-cascades-provide-variety-fall-instruction-modalities). The additional details we offer below apply to the Corvallis campus unless noted otherwise.

The decision to deliver instruction primarily virtually on our Corvallis campus was difficult. However, it is fully consistent with the principles we established in our resumption plan, which the Board of Trustees will review on Friday for consistency with guidelines issued by local and state health authorities and the Higher Education Coordinating Commission. While current conditions on our Corvallis campus remain at Level 2 of the university‚Äôs [four public health levels](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/s/tdml14g559oah972olzvwzs46d2e39gk), conditions are trending toward Level 3. Although the path of the virus remains uncertain, students, faculty and staff need clarity regarding fall teaching and operations in order to prepare for the term.

The university‚Äôs COVID-19 [Safety and Success website](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/) and [this video](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_oxupk2bk) offer details on what OSU will look like this fall. The following provides an outline, with a focus on instruction and student life. We will provide additional information on other operations in coming days.

**Choice:** To the greatest extent practicable, we are providing students with the ability to decide the location that works best for them to pursue their OSU studies. If a student feels safest living at home or off-campus and taking OSU courses remotely, almost all of our instruction will support that choice. If they choose to live on campus while they pursue their studies (mostly remotely and online), they are welcome at OSU.

Over 90 percent of OSU Corvallis course sections will be offered remotely. Courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs and field courses. Therefore, some students‚Äîespecially advanced undergraduates and graduate students‚Äîmay need to be in Corvallis in order to take those courses and continue progressing in their degree programs. The [OSU Schedule](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/) of Classes lists the instructional modality or format for each course: on-site/in-person, remote, a blend of on-site/in-person and remote, and online through Ecampus. Regardless of instructional modality, courses will be compelling and engaging, supporting students in achieving their academic goals.

**Living on campus:** Residence halls will be open to students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Capacity will be reduced to offer only single and double occupancy rooms and to create space for use in isolating and quarantining, should it be needed. We have adjusted our First Year Experience Live-on policy so that all first-year students otherwise subject to this policy may make the choice to remain at home. If students elect to stay at home and attend OSU remotely, no exemption request is required. Students with a current UHDS contract who decide to stay home must cancel their contract by emailing [housing@oregonstate.edu](mailto:housing@oregonstate.edu).

Buildings with classrooms and teaching laboratories for in-person instruction and applied learning will be open during fall term, along with the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, buildings that provide students with student services and study spaces, child care, health and wellness, food services and emergency assistance. Advising services will be mostly provided remotely.

**Living near campus.** We know that many students remain in and around Corvallis during the summer months while others will return to the area in order to utilize the university‚Äôs facilities, information technology infrastructure, and support programs while taking remote or online courses. Therefore, the campus will be open under modified conditions to support those students, and we will have public health measures and COVID-19 testing protocols in place. We ask all students, faculty and staff accessing the campus and living in the Corvallis community to be vigilant in adhering to OSU, local and state public health guidelines, and to participate in voluntary virus testing.

**Public health measures:** The multiple public health measures we have implemented include [physical distancing](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-040_COVID19_social_distancing) and [face covering requirements](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-041_COVID19_face_covering); enhanced cleaning protocols within university buildings; isolation and quarantine rooms in residence halls; improved HVAC filtration, where possible; expanded availability of hand sanitizer; and other public health measures recommended by local and state health officials. These measures are working well and have helped OSU to offer selected programs and services on-site and in-person over the summer.

**On campus testing:** We will test continuously for the prevalence of the virus that causes COVID-19 on the Corvallis and OSU-Cascades campuses and at the Hatfield Marine Science Center with the expert guidance of OSU researchers leading the [TRACE-COVID-19](https://trace.oregonstate.edu/) project. In addition to prevalence testing, we will monitor wastewater on our campuses and at HMSC for the presence of the virus. We are also exploring providing an initial test to students who choose to live on campus in Corvallis and students arriving from out-of-state hotspot communities.

**Financial assistance and student fees:** The OSU Board of Trustees froze tuition rates for the 2020-21 academic year for continuing OSU undergraduates enrolled in Corvallis, Bend, Portland and at Eastern Oregon University; we are increasing need-based financial aid assistance for eligible students; and we are preserving scholarship offers for students who elect to study elsewhere in the fall and return to OSU in a subsequent term. As well, fees associated with Student Fee-funded programs are now under review by student leaders. Information on any student fee reductions will be provided after the student fee committees complete their review.

**Research and Extension.** Campus-based research activities and fieldwork will follow existing resumption [guidelines](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/keep-researching) and on-site OSU Extension activities around the state will take place as local conditions permit.

We certainly had hoped that we would be at a different place in the national battle with COVID-19 by this point in the summer, such that we would be able to return to a significant complement of on-site and in-person instruction for fall term. However, we believe that by shifting to a primarily virtual instructional format, while also offering a limited mix of on-site teaching that facilitates students‚Äô continued progress toward their degree, we will maintain a low density of activity on the Corvallis campus and help minimize the spread of COVID-19. Of course, we are prepared to pivot to fully remote operations if public health considerations dictate such a decision.

We sincerely appreciate the patience and understanding of all members of the OSU community as we adjust to ever-changing pandemic conditions and public health circumstances. Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health and success.

As resilient members of Beaver Nation, we will continue to respond, adapt and recover from these challenging times and become an even stronger community and better university for all we serve.

Sincerely,

F. King Alexander¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

gk4x2t,SHS Pharmacy is being closed permanently....followed by the entirety of SHS in five years.,75,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonStateUniv/comments/gk4x2t/shs_pharmacy_is_being_closed_permanentlyfollowed/,14,2020-05-15 07:56:40+00:00,Xen0plasm," 

Somebody else posted about this recently, but OSU administration is about to begin drastic reductions to the overall capacity of student health services, starting with the permanent elimination of the SHS pharmacy. *Some people* responded to the other post with some ""spicy"" accusations of phishing attempts....it was not a phishing attempt, and making accusations of such things is very counterproductive in this context. If you lack the patience to wait for someone to verify sources, don't get involved. 

  
Anyway, I ran into one of the SHS pharmacy technicians at Fred Meyer a few days ago. I knew this technician because they helped me acquire travel meds for an internship last year. They told me that the pharmacy was told without warning that they'd be closing at the end of the term. Apparently there was a degree of animosity between Grace Kuo, dean of the College of Pharmacy, and (I think) Jennifer Davis, the director of the SHS pharmacy; according to the technician, the director was defending the pharmacy, and that was one of the reasons she became a scapegoat. Apparently the director offered her resignation in exchange for the promise that the pharmacy would remain active, which was obviously not the case. 

The other piece of information the technician gave to me is that OSU is going to **permanently eliminate Student Health Services and replace it with a privatized service offered by Samaritan Health** in five years. 

Of course, the reasoning for both of these changes boils down to money. Despite that various university sports coaches are still being paid their exhorbitant salaries (even in the absence of actual sporting events), the fact that the SHS Pharmacy helps train students from the College of Pharmacy, and the fact that having a school pharmacy *might help a little during a global pandemic,* the pharmacy is somehow higher on the list for being eliminated.

As far as my source, I have every reason to trust the technician who gave me this information; this technician went above and beyond his duties to help me acquire the medication I needed for my internship last year, and was very honest about the realities of acquiring certain medications in quantity and the probability of my insurance covering them. For sake of protecting their future job prospects, I am not going to identify the technician; they are one of [the staff members listed at the bottom of this webpage](https://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/pharmacy), and that is the furthest I am willing to go. 

I don't know what  to do about this, and I probably don't have time to help very much with it. The only real idea I have for confronting this is that some of the organizations that help fund the College of Pharmacy might not like to find out that the school is getting rid of their own pharmacy to save money instead of pulling funds out of their expensive sports programs. The SHS pharmacy is a very direct means of training students who want to become pharmacists, and it's hard to frame the loss of the pharmacy as anything other than a loss to the students in the College of Pharmacy, and to the university as a whole. 

I don't know if it would work, but if someone could demonstrate to the organization(s) providing funding to the College of Pharmacy that OSU has degraded the functionality to the college for the sake of saving money, it might make the donors/grant committees a little unhappy.",fqozhqb,[deleted],28.0,None,fqppsng,"As far as your lengthy post goes, I'll only comment to this part: "" *If you lack the patience to wait for someone to verify sources, don't get involved*.""

You are right: wait until there is an official announcement regarding this question. Until then your post is nothing more than just fear-mongering, speculation, and gossip. It doesn't serve any other purposes than sparking an argument about what might happen in the future, what might OSU do, and how athletic jobs are still being paid the same way (which, I'm sure, is because of their contracts -- you can't just violate a valid contract and not pay them without mutual agreement...).

They tried to get the city council to pass a ""law"" limiting everyone who lives in town and has been following the rules. City council said ""our PD does not have the resources to be the party patrol"" and makes it a 'recommendation' instead. 

Why did OSU invite thousands of students to live on (and off) campus? Money > health. Same as ever, they put the burden of solving hard problems on the City of Corvallis (housing comes to mind).

It's still a shit situation for the university though, for example they have cut the salary of every employee making above $50k (the rate of cutting increases with salary up to 12% at $222k) because they have a projected defecit of $50 million this year.

On the other side, the Corvallis economy would not be nearly what it is without the university (obviously). If no students came back, many businesses would need to close permanently (and might still from what I've been reading).

Not saying ANYTHING justifies OSU's piss poor response to the situation, just highlighting that it is a nuanced issue.

n3juzk,"Mugshot of Edmund Creffield, leader of a cult that was based in Corvallis in the early 1900's known as The Holy Rollers (story in comments).",66,https://i.redd.it/qkrnobwnvsw61.png,7,2021-05-03 00:32:50+00:00,None,,gwq8k5y,"From wikipedia, ""Edmund Creffield"".


""Edmund Creffield did not say anything outrageous when he first came to Corvallis in 1903, preaching mostly about ""the beauty of the full Gospel.""[5] Soon his followers believed he was receiving messages directly from God.[6] Creffield preached for hours on end and his followers loudly rolled on the floor pleading for God's forgiveness. When their cacophonous meetings began running into the early morning hours, Creffield was barred from holding services within city limits.[7]

During the summer he and his followers camped out on Kiger Island in the Willamette River. When the fall rains started Sarah Hurt and her three children, Maud, Frank, and Mae, some of his most ardent followers, invited him and about twenty others to move into their house just outside Corvallis. In October the group burned most of the house‚Äôs contents including furniture, utensils, heirlooms, a cat, and a dog.[8] Reports that a baby had been sacrificed were false.

People soon began to ask if Creffield could really ""live in the same locked house with a number of young girls, and do nothing in the world but be religious.""[9]

In January 1904, twenty vigilantes called the White Caps tarred and feathered Creffield, and told him to leave town and never come back. The next day Creffield and Maud Hurt were married in a room where ""the odor of [pine] tar was noticeable.""[10]

In February Creffield was accused of having adulterous relations in Portland with Maud‚Äôs aunt, Donna Starr. Adultery was a criminal offense, so a warrant was put out for his arrest. A statewide manhunt went on for months. Meanwhile, many of his followers fasted and spent their days lying flat on the floor praying.[11] Most were committed to either the Oregon State Insane Asylum or the Boys and Girls Aid Society in Portland.

In July, one month after Sarah Hurt was committed, Creffield was discovered nude and starving under her house. Creffield said he was innocent, but was found guilty and served seventeen months in the Oregon State Penitentiary. When released, he claimed he was Jesus Christ risen from the dead, his resurrection being his emergence from prison.[12]

Creffield said he was responsible for the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and his followers, all of whom had been released from the asylum, believed him.[13] ""Creffield is Jesus Christ,"" Cora Hartley said. ""He condemned the city of San Francisco and brought the earthquake; he has condemned the city of Corvallis and an earthquake will destroy this place.""[14] She and the others obeyed his order to evacuate to the coast.

In April, Louis Hartley, a wealthy mine owner, followed his wife, Cora, and daughter, Sophie, when they went to Newport to meet up with Creffield and the others. As the group boarded a ferry, Hartley fired a revolver four times at Creffield. The gun snapped harmlessly because the centerfire cartridges were wrong for the rimfire gun.[15]

Others were also gunning for Creffield, so he fled to Seattle with Maud. There, George Mitchell, Esther's brother, found him and, in front of witnesses, killed him.[16]

Multnomah County‚Äôs district attorney, John Manning, sent King County‚Äôs prosecuting attorney, Kenneth Mackintosh, a letter saying, ""I investigated many, many charges against him [Creffield] while he was on his Holy Rolling tour in Oregon, the character of which were perfectly awful, in so far as being low, degenerate and brutal, and if permitted, I would like an opportunity to testify before the grand jury, before Mitchell is indicted ‚Ä¶ I think the taking of the law in one‚Äôs own hands, under such circumstances, to mete out summary justice is almost excusable."".[17] Mackintosh was appalled by Manning‚Äôs suggestion.

O.V. Hurt, Creffield's father-in-law, hired one of the best law firms in Seattle to defend George. Numerous witnesses testified to telling George that ""free love""[18] took place in 1903. They said they told George that Creffield preached that Christ would be reborn and one of the Brides‚Äô of Christ would be the new Mary and that he needed to lay his hands upon them and purify them.[19] They said they told George that mothers were debauched in front of their daughters, including Sarah and her then sixteen-year-old daughter, Mae.[20] They said they told George that finally Creffield announced that the new Mary was Esther Mitchell, the then sixteen-year-old sister of George.""[21]

Many believe that much of the testimony was perjury, a tactic to avoid hearsay and put Creffield on trial. George was found not guilty by reason of insanity and released. Two days later, Esther shot and killed him using a gun Maud bought using their witness fees.[22]

O.V. was devastated, but still loved his daughter so he hired the same lawyers who had defended George, to defend her.[23] Before the case went to trial, Maud committed suicide.[24] Esther was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed to Western State Hospital, an asylum in Steilacoom, Washington.[25]

Esther was released from the asylum in 1909.[26] She committed suicide in 1914.""",14.0,None,gwqcw9d,Maybe this is common among creepy people's mugshots but goddamn does his mugshot project so many scary things.,3.0,ThatHappyCamper,gwrgvl8,"That's so breathtaking,so terrific",0.0,Few-Scheme6111

I come home and my girlfriend informs me that this officer has a reputation for being a complete dick,  making BS stop, and all with zero sympathy. 

I Google his name to find he's pulled a gun on an unarmed black man that ""was wearing the same clothes"" as a warrant suspect. Didn't even ask the guys name. Just rolled up with a gun.

So my question is, has anyone else had any experience with this cop? Is so what was it like? Also does he show up to trials for tickets he writes?

Has anyone ever beat his tickets? How was the court fight?",h666dan,Fight the ticket and file a complaint report about the officer. Do you run any apps while driving that shows your speed???

j5lje4,Winter Term 2021 to be predominantly remote,62,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonStateUniv/comments/j5lje4/winter_term_2021_to_be_predominantly_remote/,25,2020-10-05 15:33:33+00:00,sushithoughts,"Email pasted below: 

Dear OSU Corvallis students,
 
We write to announce decisions regarding instruction for winter term for the Corvallis campus.
 
Based on continued careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 pandemic locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU‚Äôs Corvallis campus will continue providing instruction primarily through remote modalities for winter term 2021. Winter term plans for the OSU-Cascades campus will be announced by Oct. 15. 
 
We will continue to use remote delivery to contribute to student wellness and educational success, limit the density of activity on-campus and in the Corvallis community, and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19. As with fall term, courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs, field courses and some graduate courses.
 
By the time registration opens in mid-November, the OSU Schedule of Classes will list the instructional modality for each course, as determined in consultation with academic units. Our aim is to limit the need for students to change where they live based on how winter term courses are offered.
 
We plan to have the following building open on the Corvallis campus during winter term: those with classrooms and teaching laboratories used for in-person instruction and applied learning, UHDS residence halls and dining centers, the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, Valley Library, and other buildings that provide child care, Student Health Services, food services, emergency assistance and study spaces (such as LInC). OSU updates the open/closed buildings list regularly. Student advising will continue to be provided mostly remotely.
 
Residence halls will continue to be open for students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Students who chose to remain in their home community during fall term but wish to live on campus for winter and spring terms are welcome to live on campus. Visit University Housing & Dining Services‚Äô or email housing@oregonstate.edu.
 
As we plan for spring term, we will closely monitor COVID-19 conditions and if possible, provide increased in-person instruction, extra-curricular and experiential learning opportunities for students. We will communicate more details on spring term as winter term is underway.
 
Winter term tuition and fees will be the same as fall term. Student fees for the academic year will be based upon recommendations from student leaders in Corvallis and at OSU-Cascades.
 
Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health, safety and educational success. Thank you for being a resilient and responsible member of Beaver Nation.
 
Sincerely,
 
F. King Alexander

With that being said, my recommendation is to talk specifically with the DAS office (the office that works with students to get accommodations) because they sometimes are able to have processes where the university/individual colleges have provided funds to be used to go towards the expensive testing. You could always try and see if that works.

Option B: Just try for a 2nd opinion from a healthcare provider (like a primary care physician) that takes your insurance and explain your situation from a psychological perspective and see if they can refer you for psych care with you doing some free tests online and showing them the results (someone else suggested this in this comments section). The psychologist might then be able to evaluate you for cheaper than $2000. Potentially. I don't know this from experience. Basically what I'm trying to explain is that the SHS ""network"" of healthcare providers is going to be more limited than other clinical practices that are out there.

Seems pretty cut and dry. She resisted arrest, so they dropped her(relatively softly tbh) to the grass to put on cuffs. I‚Äôm not going to comment on if she deserved to be arrested in the first place, but thinking that there was any racial injustice here or police overreaction is ignorant and simply incorrect, imo.

> can I sit up?

> sure.

*officer helps lift her up*

>I can get up by myself!

> no you aren‚Äôt.

> let me get up by myself

> no. Stop or you aren‚Äôt getting up.

> okay I‚Äôd rather lay down.

*she repeats this a bit*

*officers lay her down on her stomach*

> please let me sit up by myself

> no.

*conversation is repeated a few times*

*women again says she will not answer questions, just like she‚Äôs been saying since the beginning of the video*

> can you stop touching me?

*officer continues to hold on to her arm with the one hand*
> no. 

> can you stop touching me? It‚Äôs making uncomfortable.

*officer releases her*

> can I sit up?

> no.

*moves a bit, can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs trying to get up or not*

> don‚Äôt try to get up.

*women calls out to bystanders, asking for someone to send their mother a ‚Äúvideo or something‚Äù. Phone numbers(multiple, because she gives the incorrect phone number first) are bleeps out.*

*3rd officer arrives to keep back the bystanders that keep walking up behind the officer with the women*.

*women again asks to sit up a few times. Officer again denies the request.*

*4th officer arrives. First officer explains why she is under arrest to the officer, and the 2nd officer tells the 4th officer to be mindful of the cuffs, because they were put on very lightly/softly, since he didn‚Äôt want to hurt her wrists.*

*there are more than just 4 officers now, but 5 and 6 don‚Äôt seem to do anything.*

*4th officer notifies the arrested women she is here to do the search, because she is a female officer.*

> can I stand up?

> I would like you to get up.

*again, officers hold her as she gets up, and again, she protests being touched(however, she only calls out against the male, not the female officer)*

*again, asks to not be touched. Officer has to tell her that, since she is in custody, she won‚Äôt be waking on her own.*

To me, it seems like the main issue is the women both didn‚Äôt want to speak to the police(which is perfectly legal, but you can be detained for this. However, there is nothing wrong with someone enacting their right to be silent or following [STFU Friday](https://youtu.be/JTurSi0LhJs)) and also constantly spoke out about being detained. 

If she had answered the original questions, she *probably* wouldn‚Äôt have been detained(see the beginning of this comment for the quotes about why she was arrested). Maybe identifying herself somehow would have notified the police that she was dangerous or wanted, but I doubt it. Also, if she hadn‚Äôt attempted to stand up on her own and then explicitly stated she would ‚Äúrather lay down‚Äù, she would have been sitting normally on the curb, which would have been much more comfortable(emotionally, I don‚Äôt mean feel better sitting on a hard curb than laying in grass).
