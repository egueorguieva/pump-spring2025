I'm an undergrad student here at BYU and I feel very lost and confused. After spending the last good while (2+ years) studying and learning about LDS theology, I no longer believe it. I just don't. I'm not here to argue about that or talk about specifics. It is a decision backed by more careful thought and study than anything else I have done up to this point in my life. I even ended up returning home early from my mission because of it (mostly painted over as a 'mental health' exit), but I still ended up back here for the finances/convenience. I am thinking now that it may have been a mistake. I feel so alone, like nobody does or could understand me. I don't know what my next step should be. I've been thinking about transferring literally anywhere but I'm so far along in terms of credits here that I think it may set my life back a good bit, not to mention essentially uprooting all of my social circles and likely completely changing my family relationships. I just don't even know if its worth it, do I just shut up and drag myself through the next couple years? Is it even an option to stay? I do really like BYU I just can't anymore with the church, I have like zero desire to attend Sunday meetings or even pretend like I care about the LDS lifestyle you know? I lowkey just need someone who's gone through what I'm going through or understands what I'm saying cause I have no one that seems to get it. I'm sorry if this reads like a trash can of unorganized thoughts cause it basically is haha but I'd love any advice. Thanks :)",

The women on campus are out of control. Just today I was ambushed by 4 different females while studying my scriptures in the WILK. It's like they can smell my righteousness the moment I step into a room. It's not my fault God called me to be an Assistant President. I'm of a different breed among mankind. Sue me. 

Last week, I was speaking to an old companion over the phone in my mission language. As I masterfully wove the most beautiful vocal tapestry in the Spanish language (that's right, I served overseas), I couldn't help but notice the drooling daughters of God that surrounded me. One of them tried to approach me, but I fended her off with the power of the spirit. After a few minutes, she finally realized that I didn't want to copulate against the glass walls of the Garden Court, and I was able to get back to my daily language study. 

In my classes, I know I'm different from everyone else. As they tell stories from their missions, I can't help but feel bad for them. They don't know what it was like to be an Assistant President. One of the guys in my Eternal Families class (easy for someone like me) tried to tell me that AP stands for ""Assistant to the President"", but I could tell he was just jealous of me. When the ladies have to pick between me and him, he knows who they will run to. 

It's just tiring to know that every time I step out of the house, I'm going to bombarded with marriage proposals and Facebook friend requests. Normal former missionaries just don't understand what it's like to live with a burden like this. Sometimes I resent my strong spirit and perfect knowledge of the scriptures. There's a reason my bishop asks me not to bear my testimony on fast Sunday. We both know that the average young woman wouldn't be able to keep her panties dry listening to me recite the First Vision from memory. The first time I did it, multiple ward members had to leave early because they couldn't handle my massive spirit. 

I'm sick and tired of girls only seeing me for the fact that I was an AP on my mission. Just because I led my mission to success doesn't mean that I want to lead you to 15 kids before we graduate. Does anyone else have this problem?",

I'm an alumni and graduated from the Marriott school MISM program. I now work in tech and have worked for several prominent tech companies.

My main question is though is if anybody else feels ashamed to have BYU on their resume? To be honest I bury it and don’t talk about it during interviews. It’s so tied to anti LGBTQ sentiments that I believe it’s actually harmful to find a job.

I can’t tell you how many LGBT coworkers I’ve had who feel unsafe around me as soon as they find out I went to byu or was Mormon, and I have to tell them that I do in fact support gay marriage and want them to know they’re included and safe and that I believe god loves them just the way they are without needing to change.

Anyways just a curiosity if anyone else feels this way too.",

raok2y,174,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/raok2y/aptive_summer_sales_pest_control_sales_dont_do_it/,138,2021-12-07 02:37:23+00:00,None,"Aptive Summer Sales, Pest Control Sales Don't Do it Rookies!!!! If you're thinking about selling **Door-to-Door pest control** or someone is trying to recruit you, **DON'T** do it, this is from personal experience and will tell you the secrets no one else will.



First of all I've done this previously now and if you are like most rookies you will NOT make the money they tell you, you will make. Remember these guys are salesman and will really persuade you to give it a try and not listen to others who are viewing as a negative experience.




The way it works is you sell pest control contracts d2d (door to door) they are usually for 1-year and will average a contract value of for example $520. You as a salesman will get a % and usually they start rookies out at 25% (which is terrible by the way) so that's $130 in commissions per sale you will make. The recruiter will sell you this idea you can make $20,000, $40,000, $100,000 in one summer. **Reality is 99% will NOT.** It's a very hard industry you are knocking door to door 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.



Now that I get out of the way how it works, Let me show you the realty of it and not only MY experience but experience with other friends and coworkers and how we all get screwed and YOU will too.



So they will most likely give you a % of 25%, 30% or maybe even a little higher. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't sell and service over 100 accounts or sometimes even 150 accounts you will get a low flat percentage of 18%. This will cost you thousands of dollars. For example if you go out and work your butt off and you finish the summer with 95 accounts serviced. ($520x95accounts = $49,400(18%) you are only making $8,892 this is not including rent, groceries, gas, entertainment, etc. so you will make a LOT less than you would staying home with your parents working for $8-$15/hour. Since they prey on college students or returned missionaries from the LDS church.That is ONLY ONE WAY they will try and screw you over.



Another way is if you do happen to go against their favor and you do service over 100 or 150 accounts I've had friends I worked with who didn't even get their commission checks. So the way it works is during the summer you will get only $50 upfront for each serviced accounts and the rest of the commission you will get in the ""backend"" (rest of commission checks later in the year, 2 of them) which usually payout a few months later in November, and January. I've had friends who are out there busting all hot summer for 3-4 months to end up not getting anything. There recruiter will lie and say some of there accounts canceled and it fell below the 150 or 100 accounts serviced. To put in perspective let's say you sold and serviced 150 accounts and you get your $50 for each one ($50x150= $7,500 during the summer) with expectations you are going to get a $15,900 after the summer only to come to find out your recruiter kept all your money then will lie to you that some of your accounts weren't legit or they canceled. Keeping $15,900 of your earned money.

**I had a friend who sold and serviced 198 accounts..** and signed a 35% commission plan, which would of been like $36,000+ he would made (since I don't remember his average contract value) **he ended making only $9,900** ($50 upfront per sale x 198accounts = $9,900) and his recruiter would end up keeping $41,100+ (I figured this since if he only got paid it $9,900 that would be only 10% since he didn't get his backend checks. Since the recruiter can recruit someone and give them a commission deal the recruiter will make the difference of 50%, for example 50%-10%(whatever number they sign a recruit at) = 40% recruiter keeps) we will say he averaged a contract value of $520 x 198accounts = $102,960 revenue (40% recruiter keeps if they screw you over) Recruiter keeps $41,000 and this is how they make their money my screwing over multiple recruits and obviously wanting a couple of them to succeed because they will make override commissions of that recruit but also any recruits they bring on to the team the following summers, almost like a pyramid.


**DON'T sell door-to-door pest control**, 99% of the time they will screw you over. They are not in the industry to make it into a career, they are in it to recruit and have unexperienced and uneducated first year reps make their money year after year. Please spread the word and share this post with people who are thinking about doing it. This is how your recruiter is able to afford all the stuff they are showing off to you. (cars, trucks, clothes, gadgets, toys, lifestyle, travelling, etc.) You will be working 12 hour days, 6 days a week to make money for their pockets and since you're a 1099 ""employee"" that signed some pathetic agreement they can get away with this. You should really avoid any sales recruiter If you have any questions comment below or message me. I got screenshots of my previous agreement commission plan and screenshots how I got screwed over and I sold over the 150 amount.  


If you have any experiences similar or know of anyone who this happened to post below. Let's make it aware for others before going out and wasting their summer since some of us have tuition bills to pay, families to support, etc.

**To add:** Aptive and it’s recruiters/team leaders really do be trying to set you up for failure or set the odds against you however you want to look at it. Because they have control on what they put down on the agreement you sign for example.

- 18% if you don’t service over 150 accounts
- 18% if you switch to a technician (but in reality you won’t get any of it)
- they keep ALL your money if you leave home early (over 60% of reps do)
- if you don’t service a minimum of 6 accounts/week you will get written up then fired if it happens again, resulting in your recruiter keeping ALL your money (recruiters will say this is in both our best interest because we don’t want you to be out here if you’re not selling, but just imagine if you have to take a few days off for a wedding or you get sick.. lol)
- if you go home even a day early from the dates you told them on paper, written you are voiding your contract and they can keep all your money. Even if they say “talk to us and we’re understanding” don’t believe it, only what’s in writing actually is true. Had it happen to a buddy who went home only 2 days early from his end date and kept ALL his money..


Still think I’m only talking about my experience and a personal few other people I know, or maybe that I’m not a good sales rep? Lol If you got time read this:

My name is Tanner Bennett, I’m a 24 year old student and I’m running for Provo City Council! 

I’m extremely excited for this opportunity to participate in the democratic process, and wanted to tell you a bit about myself, my campaign, and why I’m running. 

Link to socials: [https://linktr.ee/bfp2023](https://linktr.ee/bfp2023)

# About me:

I’m a full-time student at BYU studying political science and Mandarin. I’ve spent my whole time at BYU studying about politics and the political process and felt compelled to try and participate when the opportunity presented itself. 

I am a global sales executive at a company in pleasant grove and have an extensive work history/background in building, working for, and running nonprofits. 

# Why I’m running: 

Provo is Utah’s 4th largest municipality with about 115,000 residents, 40% of which are age 18-25 with most attending BYU, UVU or one of the other colleges/technical schools located nearby. This 40% of Provo’s population has been repeatedly shafted by our City Council and major concerns of this population are completely ignored. Why is that? Frankly, **students don’t vote**. When I asked incumbents why they don’t campaign to or talk with college students it’s because we are not engaged. This is for several reasons that range from how busy we are in this stage of life, to complete apathy for government and I completely understand it.

**However, I want to change that but I need your help.**

I’m running as a moderate independent, trying to be a voice for Provo’s silent 40% on both sides of the aisle. This means that I care about:

1. Living within a budget (but also setting a budget that realistically can achieve what provo actually needs)
2. Acting as a voice for renters against abusive/manipulative landlords and providing concrete reporting methods and fines against landlords that refuse to resolve major issues for their tenants. 
3. Promoting active transportation and increasing Provo’s walk/bike/scooter friendliness.
4. Increase the level of shuttling and public transport offered for areas further from the universities
5. Continuing to fund, maintain, and improve Provo's trails, biking paths, and conservation/sustainability efforts! (Also improving our leash laws and improving their control/implementation-- nearly been bitten a bit too much!).
6. Improving the parking situation all over Provo while focusing on increasing our greenspaces.
7. Working to further improve the level of inclusivity for members of the LGBTQ+ community in Provo.
8. Focusing in on developing sustainable housing solutions for Provo’s growing unhoused population.
9. Attracting more businesses to Provo and helping our current businesses to continue to grow and develop.
10. With more to come!

People seem to hate that I'm running on a ""moderate independent"" platform, but at the same time hyperpartisanship is preventing us from achieving solutions that work, are cost-effective, and are based in science and research. According to Gallup research, 37% of Americans identify as moderate, more than conservatives (36%) and more than liberal (27%). I'm hoping to bring both sides closer to the middle and actually work to get things done.

# My campaign: 

I’m running a **$0 campaign** which means I am not seeking donations and I’m not spending any money beyond what was required to register. This means I’m not spending money on: 

* signage
* hand bills
* advertisements
* campaign managers
* etc.

What I *am* doing is trying to use social media to educate, promote, and share about the importance of civic engagement and trying to get the 40% people who for sure live in Provo 3/4ths of the year to register here and vote for someone who actually cares about them and their needs. I know what it’s like being a college-age student in Provo because I am one! In office, I hope that I can keep this platform up to share updates and news in a way similar to how Rep. Jeff Jackson has been doing, I think this kind of campaigning and communication is the future.

If you’ve read this long and this sounds like something you would support, I ask that you please take the time to like (or upvote), follow my social media accounts and help share my message! Together we can keep money out of politics and do a lot of good for Provo!  

Even if I’m not the person for you, I sincerely hope you’ll register and take the time to find someone who you do want to vote for! In municipal elections, your vote matters more than in any other.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hope that if you have questions you will reach out! Thanks again!

I know the past few weeks have been rough for BYU and BYU Athletics (and, just as a caveat, I 100% agree with our recent statement that we all need to be better and work together to create a safe, inclusive environment at BYU).

However, going to the BYU Baylor game last night reminded me of what makes BYU great—I believe that \*most\* BYU fans, at their core, are kind (if imperfect) people who want to make the world a better place. 

There were so many things to love about last night—the enthusiasm in the stadium was insane, and I sat by a bunch of Baylor fans who told me that we were the nicest fanbase they've ever interacted with (which is so good to hear!)

The best part of the night, though, was at the very end, when Jaren Hall walked over to Jake Oldroyd, who was bawling his eyes out, and gave him a huge hug.

For context, Oldroyd had missed two field goals (one at the end of regulation, one in the first overtime) that would have won us the game. I'm sure he was absolutely devastated as we headed into the second overtime. That kind of mistake can weigh heavily on a player. 

When we won the game, you could tell Oldroyd was absolutely relieved. Jaren Hall walked over to him and held him. What a stellar leader and teammate!

Although BYU fans aren't perfect and we definitely have lots of room for change and growth, I also believe that my time at BYU taught me how to be a better person, leader, and friend. I hope moving forward that we can all emulate Jaren's example, because that is the kind of BYU that I want to represent!!",

The fact is BYU is failing to hold up their end of the agreement to protect us and unintentionally created an environment that invites monopoly-like behavior. Raintree apparently isn't the first time something like this has happened according to the comment section, so there's nothing that's going to stop it from happening in the future unless we demand change.

Taking more than 15 credits in your first semester is probably a BAD IDEA. 

Especially if you are taking notoriously difficult classes, i.e. econ 110, chem 105 

I graduated high school as valedictorian with a 4.0 gpa and 11 AP classes under my belt. My first semester, I took 16 credits. I didn't have a job. I got a 2.9 GPA that semester and lost my scholarship at the end of the year. Plus I changed my major two years later so I really wasted my time.

You have at least 3-4 years ahead of you. There's no rush! Take 12-14 credits and give yourself time to adjust. Replace a hard class with a lecture series or two. for many freshmen, this will be your first time living away from home, which is a huge adjustment by itself.

Also, IMO, AP classes do not really prepare you for a college class. Most high school teachers don't implement the same structure and format that you will see in a college class. My AP classes gave me false confidence in my college abilities.

Squeezing in 1-2 extra classes is NOT worth starting your college career with a low gpa. Especially if you have a scholarship with gpa requirements! Prioritize that scholarship. 

TL;DR: Be humbler than I was, take less than 15 credits, build a solid gpa, give yourself some time to adjust to BYU.",

I feel like the general premise that BYU is to be different from other universities is a valid argument to make, but that argument loses its validity for me when we begin categorizing anything contrary to our own political views as the ""worldly ideology"" that BYU is allegedly adopting and, according to leaders, consequently destroying itself with.

Select leaders of the Church (oddly enough, the ones who have served as presidents of the university in the past) seem very concerned with the trajectory of BYU, and I can't really seem to understand why. Elder Holland's speech to the faculty of BYU last year seemed to trigger this culture of concern, and it seems to have stuck around pretty strongly since. I feel like BYU is simply just shifting the way we build our communities and treat and understand marginalized groups. Certainly there are students at BYU who are antagonistic toward the Church in general, but they seem to be a very vocal minority--I feel like the majority of students who are hurt by these kinds of teachings are not these, but are those who love the Church and the gospel but are navigating how to be more open-minded toward different viewpoints, perspectives, and backgrounds. Speeches like President Oaks' feel a bit divisive to me because it conveys this idea that we all have to think the same, act the same, look the same, and be essentially a monolith structured by Church leaders, and I simply don't agree with that notion. I also feel like that black-and-white approach is harmful and more faith-destructing than faith-promoting, because it teaches people that if they have doubts, questions, or concerns, that they should just leave BYU/the Church instead of wrestling with them and seeking to gain ""further light and knowledge."" In my opinion, some of the fence-sitters in the Church are genuinely good people just seeking to build a testimony on truth rather than tradition and they are having a hard time because leaders are rushing them in their process of receiving answers to their desperate questions and prayers. It's doing more harm than good, in my opinion.

I wasn't seeking to be offended by the devotional, and I don't feel that I was, just trying to grapple with why this topic felt ""priority"" and the point President Oaks was really trying to make. I don't see the ""destruction"" of BYU's uniqueness as a priority in my book when there are members of the Church literally killing themselves because they feel like they don't belong in their wards, communities, college campuses, etc. I just came away from this feeling like there is an imbalance in priorities among a few of the leaders. I think they're doing their best to tackle difficult subjects in today's world, but sometimes the execution just doesn't resonate with me. I'd love to hear what you guys thought--I'm curious to see if anyone felt similarly, or if anyone interpreted this speech differently.",

A family member of mine was a straight-A student in high school who attended BYU on an academic scholarship. She figured her future husband would be the breadwinner, so she majored in something useless and irrelevant (humanities, I think?) 

After graduating, she married some guy and just had a kid with him. Right after she found of she was pregnant, her husband got laid off. He is still looking for a job, and in the meantime, the best she can do is work...retail. That's right, our former honor student with her fancy BYU degree is working alongside high school kids earning poverty wages. She graduated from college with no marketable skills, so thus far only retail will hire her.

I've seen this happen over and over and over again: academically-talented young women who put all their eggs in the homemaker basket and then get a rude awakening when they get divorced, widowed, their husband loses his job, or they never find a husband in the first place. I recently brought this up in in last week's Gospel Doctrine class (we were discussing the principle of self-reliance) and literally every person in the room had a similar story from their friend circle.

I think it's great that BYU and the Church extol the preeminence of motherhood and I'm *not* dissing SAHMs, but you must be prepared to take on the role of breadwinner should the need arise and earlier you can develop those skills or earn those credentials, the better off you'll be. ",

We know from history the church has been wrong so what’s up with this teaching becoming so pervasive nowadays? 

Additionally, stating that people aren’t truly following Christ unless they’re doing it through the Church is just so weird when we simultaneously acknowledge the validity of other denominational Christians, and many of my current friends continue to believe in and follow Christ independent of the church because of bad experiences they’ve had. We need to honor that instead of judging it. 

Why are we getting messages like this from the church so often? It’s so exhausting and old.

So I was chatting with one of my professors last week and apparently the Office of Belonging from here on out will only be providing services for racial/ethnic minority students and disabled students. Additionally, they sent this invite out to faculty to pass along to their “LGBTQ+ students” (as if professors are supposed to just know who is queer and who isn’t, because if you’re not out you’re apparently not queer) for an activity in the Wilk and the invite originally didn’t have the location of the gathering; you had to contact Women’s Services to get the room number. My professor chose to add it on regardless. 

How is Women’s Services an appropriate organization to house LGBTQ+ efforts on campus? How are queer issues strictly women’s issues? This is just so bizarre and sad to me. LGBTQ+ are by far the most mistreated students on campus and to not allow them a space in an office designed to integrate belonging is just cruel. And to advertise LGBTQ+ events intentionally without a room number to gatekeep the event and (presumably) require potentially closeted students to reach out first to get the location makes me super weary. This is why I am not out at BYU and probably never will be. 

I had high hopes for this office, but it seems to be turning out to be just another disappointing, virtue signaling pick-and-choose fest. Anyone know anyone who works at the office of belonging or has more insight on what on earth is going on here? I’d love another perspective if I’m getting it wrong here, but from what I’ve been told I can’t help but feel like the university is yet again signaling that it doesn’t care about its queer population.

Edit: here is insider information provided below from someone who talked with an employee in the office: 

“Here’s what I’ve learned today from a member of the Office of Belonging…

-- Any student who wants to talk with someone at the Office of Belonging is absolutely welcome and encouraged to come in, including LGBTQ+ students. Students who have experienced any form of discrimination can make their reports through in the Office of Belonging.

-- The Office of Belonging wants LGBTQ students, along with students from other demographics, to participate on student councils, in focus groups, as student employees/researchers, and on panels. If any student is interested in becoming involved with these projects, they’re encouraged to reach out to the Office of Belonging.

-- The Office of Belonging will be involved in developing education and training for employees and students. The experience of LGBTQ students is an important consideration in the curriculum.

-- Rather than having just one place for LGBTQ students to find support, the Office of Belonging would love to consult with any department who is interested in creating more welcoming environments for LGBTQ students.

-- Independent Office of Belonging events will be for the entire campus community rather than specific groups (Belonging Begins with Me, etc). Any demographic-specific events will be cosponsored with other departments. Ex- The Office of Belonging will not independently organize an event for students with disabilities but would consider co-sponsoring an event organized by the University Accessibility Center.”",

While increased media attention and sustained critiques regarding conservative stances on social issues have caused a PR nightmare for BYU's administration, one less acknowledged point of secular judgment stems from BYU's rigid and seemingly arbitrary enforcement of the beard ban.

While the beard ban once served the purpose of discouraging anti-authoritarian protests in the 60s and 70s, nowadays the meaning of the beard ban has faded into obscurity. Instead of serving any apparent social cause, the beard ban seems to be enforced as a matter of tradition. Although beards have no negative connotation in contemporary society (indeed, they may have a positive connotation), BYU has continued to enforce the ban as a matter of principle.

While it is entirely within BYU's rights to enforce such a ban, I suspect that by doing so, they inadvertently cast a bad light on the University as well as its sponsoring organization the LDS church. To outsiders, the continued enforcement of a 1960's dress code seems to denote a spirit of rigidity and inflexibility that permeates BYU's administration. The inability of BYU's policy to update to better accommodate contemporary social norms and grooming trends reeks of arbitrarity and dogmatism.

As the outward-facing academic institution of the LDS Church, the beard ban raises questions regarding the Church's ability to cope with similar trends on a global scale. That is, can the Church adapt and grow to meet the needs of a new generation, or, like BYU, will it stay rooted in arbitrary traditions and dogmatisms that have arisen from a previous time? If the beard ban were rooted in LDS theology, then I suspect there would be good grounds for maintaining a beard ban on campus. But, given that the original justifications for the ban have faded into obsolescence, all that remains is a shadow of BYU's (and possibly the LDS Church's) resistance to change, commitment to another generation's social norms, and a failure to update to the current needs of the modern world.",

I know BYU has always been the butt of many jokes. But I feel like it’s reached a new level. I recently graduated from BYU and attended a large orientation back east for my new work with thousands of other recent graduates. Every time someone would ask where I graduated from college and I told them BYU, their reactions were very interesting. Some people would ask about the interviews that are often filmed on campus by the black menaces account. Other people brought up the recent Netflix documentary about the FLDS church and wondered if BYU was tied to that. Other people would try not to laugh or smile when I told them I graduated from BYU. It was quite shocking, and I don’t think I would get the same response from older adults.

Have any of you experienced this as well? And no I didn’t grow up in Utah so I haven’t been living in the BYU bubble forever, but it has been shocking to the point where I don’t even enjoy telling people where I went to college. Maybe current students should do BYU a favor and stop answering questions when being filmed on campus.",

So the Church Newsroom just published this today, and sent an email out to all of us students notifying us of these changes. It's been posted in other parts of this sub, but I have to post here to add my own thoughts as an active member of the church and a current BYU student.

Dress & grooming standards doubled down on the beard ban, so no flexibility there. BYU-I students can wear shorts now (which I would hardly call progress) due to the alignment of dress and grooming standards across all CES institutions.

Honor Code doubled down on LGBTQ+ students and same-sex romantic behavior.

**Worst of all:** in order to be endorsed to attend BYU, students must do more than simply follow Honor Code standards; they are **now expected to answer questions mirroring all of the temple recommend interview questions to the satisfaction of their local leader in order to retain their academic standing at BYU.**

I have friends here who struggle with Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, aspects of church history, sustaining church leadership, paying tithing, being temple worthy, and a variety of other things. This change has absolutely told those students that they don't belong here. If you can't profess faith in these things, and prove to your bishop that you have a testimony of them, you're out.

The church is a so-called place for sinners, but I guess BYU is not. I am *furious* about this. I hope people understand just how much this will damage students and professors alike. What an absolute failure on behalf of the Church Educational Board for making these changes.

They just effectively gave the boot to more than half of my friends at BYU.",

I am a recent BYU alumni. I come from a family of die-hard BYU fans and mostly active members of the church. I, myself, am in the middle of a faith transition and as a result, am diving deeper than ever into the history, good and bad, of the church and BYU. I recently came across this information that shocked and appalled me. 

BYU approved and allowed a study in 1976 that essentially gave gay students an ultimatum: either be kicked out of school and face church and familial punishment for being gay, or participate in this “therapy”.

Not only did it traumatize most of the 14 men who went through it, but 2 of them ended up dying by suicide later and others seriously contemplated suicide.

Though this doesn’t make it okay at all, I understand that at the time, there were other “studies” and “gay aversion therapy” practices going on at other universities, yet why would BYU, a school lead, ultimately, by a prophet of God, be a part of such a disgusting thing? 

It makes me so angry that BYU, which should be a school associated with the spirit of love and kindness of Christ, not only allowed this to happen but continues to actively discriminate and tolerate hateful behavior towards LGBTQ students.

Note, as I was researching this, I learned that Dallin Oaks, who was the president of BYU at the time, was asked about this last year during a Q&A at another university but denied that this happened, which is clearly a lie. Why would an apostle blatantly lie?

I’m not looking for excuses about why this might have been accepted at the time or any “hate the sin” garbage. I just want other students to know that this happened because I never did and I want to know why it’s not acknowledged, and even lied about?

I'm really struggling with dating here at BYU. It just seems like dating has gotten more and more difficult. I'm not shy so I've asked out lots of women, gone on lots of dates as well as been turned down a bunch, but I feel like I've exhausted my usual methods of finding people to date.

I'm a 23M senior in a STEM major, so there are very few women in my classes. Those I have asked have said no. I've tried asking out women from my other classes and have rarely gotten anywhere with that. Ever since I got back from my mission I've gone out as much as possible to try to meet people, like I used to go to club night every week. I don't go as much because it seems like 90% of the women who go to on campus clubs are freshmen. That was fine when I was just back from the mission but now at 23 even thinking about asking out a girl who just graduated high school, even by accident, feels creepy and gross. I go to parties most weekends but they're too loud for conversations. I use Mutual but matches are few and far between and texts back from matches are even more rare.

I've talked to a bunch of people who have had better luck than me and haven't gotten very far. My friends in relationships are either with someone they grew up with or someone who made it obvious they were interested from the beginning. My single friends around my age are either going after freshmen or have given up.

So I'm kinda stuck. Do I just go to the library and walk up to someone cute and start talking? My parents suggested that but it feels like most people in the library are there to study or hanging out with their friends and wouldn't be very receptive to a random guy walking up and striking up a conversation. Is there really anywhere else to go to meet girls closer to my age? Or do I just have to wait until I graduate and move out of Provo?

This is really stressing me out because I'll never have as big of a dating pool as I do here. I have no clue whether I'll be able to get a job here and other YSA wards I've been in outside of Utah are sparse. Being around so many people with what I assume are similar long term goals, but not being able to click with any of them, while seeing things work out for so many others, is getting to be discouraging.",

I've been at BYU for the past 6 years earning my BS and MS. I was supposed to continue on and do a PhD, but instead I'm leaving academia to work full-time. Why? Because I lost my faith.

I won't go into details about why I'm leaving the church, but let me assure you it was a painful journey and one that I did not choose. I learned some things that fundamentally changed my understanding of the church, and after a year of praying and studying and hoping I realized I could never go back to feeling the way I once did about Joseph Smith or the current church leadership. I have no hard feelings towards the members I've known and loved throughout my life, but Mormonism just isn't for me anymore.

The hardest part of leaving the church has been deciding to leave BYU, as that has permanantly changed my career trajectory. I would absolutely stay here if I felt like I could. I'd be happy to quietly resign from the church and continue living the honor code, but as per the university's Student Standing Policy ([https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy)) that would disqualify me from an ecclesiastical endorsement. I could fake being active to keep my ecclesiastical endorsement, but I'm not willing to submit myself to that bishop's roulette game any longer than I already have. I feel like I've been forced out of my community because of something outside of my control.

In the past few years I have contributed a lot to this university. I've helped hundreds of students as a TA. I've led research projects that have brought recognition and funding to my department. I've mentored almost every new research assistant that has entered my advisor's lab. I've taught classes and presented published research at conferences. And I would have continued to do the same things for the next three+ years if BYU let me. I believe this school would have been better off with me than without me.

I'm not particularly angry about the situation. I'm going to a great job, and now that I've made my decision I'm excited for the change. But I really feel that by forcing people like me out - people who unwillingly lose their faith - BYU is shooting itself in the foot. Sure, there is a risk that former members might actively detract from the spiritual beliefs of their classmates, but BYU already has other policies in place to prevent that. I hope they reconsider their policy and start treating former church members the same as other non-members. 

The stated goal of the Honor Code is to encourage campus community members to ""conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and...to maintain the highest standards in their personal conduct regarding honor, integrity, morality, and consideration of others"". I believe I can do that outside of the church just as easily as I did it in the church. In fact, it is my honor and integrity that demands I leave the church, and it's my consideration to others that demands I not work to actively lead others out of it.

I'll miss being part of this community, and I think that this community will miss me.",

When I first went through orientation at BYU, I was interested in the way that the honor code was pitched to new students. The presenters said that the honor code first began as a grassroots effort, initiated by the student body, to promote a higher moral standard of conduct amongst the students living on campus. However, as I have progressed through my time at BYU, I am not sure if I have ever encountered any student who particularly likes the honor code. At least every student I've met seems to think that some aspects of the honor code need to be altered if not discarded altogether. 

While the honor code may have represented a grassroots student movement from the class of 1948 (when the honor code was endorsed), it no longer seems to represent the values or opinions of the student body. For that reason, it seems somewhat facetious to pitch the honor code to new students as a body of stipulations that is presently accepted by the student body.

I am curious to hear other opinions though. What are your thoughts on the honor code? Do you perceive that the majority of students like it or dislike it? Do you feel like it is time to implement any changes? If so, of what sort?",

But I think graduating with a high GPA at BYU is as tough or tougher than any school in the country. 

I had friends that went to some good schools. - UC Berkley, Pepperdine, USC, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine. 

With the exception of one friend who took his university studies very seriously, every other person I knew that went to these good schools partied their balls off. I'm talking the frat parties went down on Thursday nights. Of course Fri & Sat. Then the good ol' Sunday Funday of day drinking. - I didn't know anybody who knew anybody who partied or just drank alcohol at BYU. - The parties in Provo (with no alcohol) get shut down by the cops at midnight because the neighbors (who are married students) called and complained. 

That Testing Center is packed with people up until closing at 10 pm on Friday night. 

During my time at BYU, I swear about 40% of the students were married; some with children. 

So... Forget how hard the classes are... if your class is graded on a curve... Good luck. You're competing with students who don't party and might be married. I'm sorry but married people are more focused on doing well in school. They don't have to try to date or be social. 

I knew a guy who for whatever reason attended Brown University for his first semester of college, then transferred to BYU. He said the general ed classes he took at Brown weren't as hard as BYU's. 

I knew someone who was in the Business program at a school in southern California that everyone thinks is a top notch private school. But he really wanted to find a wife because he was 26, so he transferred to BYU and chose the shortest major - History. He said his History classes at BYU were way harder than his Business classes prior. 

I knew a girl who graduated from BYU, then got some Masters at Cal State Fullerton. She was going to be a teacher. She said BYU undergrad was harder. 

Thank you for reading my rant. 

I guess my main point is, it bothers me people don't know how hard BYU is that haven't attended. 

I have a 2.9 GPA from BYU, and was rejected from two schools for Grad School, so I'm bummed. I really had no business attending BYU. I got lucky getting in. I should have attended a state school. Then I'd have a higher GPA.

BYU can’t have double standards. They can’t force students to stay home and then penalize them for doing so. I am a vaccinated student and I social distance. Why do I have to be punished for following the rules?

I have proof of my Covid diagnosis too. The least BYU could do is excuse absences that are Covid related when a student provides proof. I feel like I’m losing my mind here- anyone else?

The code links to a blog post promoting a protest against the recent proof of vaccination requirements at public events. If you find one of these, don’t waste your time and don’t support them. Their reasons for protest are ridiculous for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, vaccination is still not a requirement. It is only indoor public events that require proof of vaccination *or a negative test result*.

Further, the blog also has a testimonial from a parent of a student athlete, in which the parent claims BYU is forbidding them from attending their child’s events. This parent trashes on BYU saying:

“I have invested much of my life to creating and nurturing this child and chose to help my child attend this school whom I actually (yes, stupidly) trusted and they treat me as if I am an enemy. They discriminate against me as if I am dirty or immoral. I am absolutely neither and I am standing up and pushing back for all students, all adults, and parents and fighting against discrimination and segregation.” 

To whoever this is and those who feel the same: You’ve probably never personally dealt with true discrimination or segregation, as other groups at BYU have, and continue to deal with. It is disgusting to me that these childish adults compare their selfish wishes to today’s true social issues. Grow up. 

Also, if this parent “stupidly trusted” BYU, why not just leave? I’m so tired of people like this playing the victim. Stop acting like you’re helpless to the situation when everything is in your power to solve it. Here are some ideas: leave BYU, get vaxxed, or just show a negative test result. 

This person also goes on to say that it is satanic to require vaccinations for such events since that is how satan would operate, and “good people would stand up to this!” Whether or not you are vaccinated, good people respect other people, and getting vaccinated or showing a negative test result are the literal bare minimum effort ways someone could show respect to the other attendees, the school, and the community in general. 

If you read the full article, you can see that the organizers are delusional. They claim that vaccination breaks the fourth amendment, is discrimination/ segregation, and is a type of bioweapon. 

Please don’t support people like this. If you choose not to get vaccinated, so be it. Clearly I am an advocate for vaccination but don’t hold it against you if you refrain. But don’t act like you don’t still have a choice under these new rules, and don’t compare yourself to truly marginalized groups. If your only social concern is vaccination, count your blessings and try to sympathize with those who are still unequal in society. 

The people who want to protest to “maintain their individual freedoms” (which they still have since nobody is forcing them to get vaccinated) are the same people fighting against (or at least not actively fighting for) women’s rights, racial injustice, LGBTQ+ rights, etc. The blatant hypocrisy is outrageous! 

I know my opinions may be unpopular in this sub, but this has to be said. I’m happy to respectfully discuss the topic further if you leave a comment. Thank you for reading my thoughts/ rant.

If I bike on the sidewalk, I risk hitting a pedestrian and crashing, not to mention that the sidewalks are already horribly maintained and extremely narrow. 

I get that there isn’t an easy solution as 900 doesn’t have a whole lot of room to begin with, but something needs to change if BYU is going to keep removing parking to make new buildings and claiming that you don’t need a car to live in Provo and go to school. 

I mean come on, the biking conditions literally get better on 900 E the **further** you get from campus. Maybe my perspective is wrong and I am being unfair, but it just seems completely backwards to me.

But instead of reducing people’s exposure to the virus, they cordoned off all the books and have employees fetch them while students stand in line. 

This doesn’t change the number of students getting their books, it just reduces the amount of space for students to spread out in. This reduces the average amount of space per student, increasing exposure risk.

Additionally, instead of 30 people pulling books off the shelves at once, there’s about 8. This increases the amount of time people spend in the bookstore; an enclosed, indoor area; increasing exposure risk.

They’d have been better off doing nothing rather than actively making the situation worse.",

It’s a great institution and I feel privileged to be here.

My main concern is that I virtually have no desire to attend church anymore. Ever since my mission my testimony has steadily declined and now I’m not sure I really believe anymore. When I attend church services I feel empty and disingenuous. I don’t want to transfer schools because I worked so hard to get here and I love it here. But I’m worried about the honor code since I don’t attend down here. My family lives an hour away so I enjoy spending weekends with them when I can. I occasionally attend church with them. 

I really want to be a good person and serve others. I want to minister to others and help bring about Zion. I figure the church is a great way to do that, but each time I attend I leave feeling sadder and more discouraged.

I still pay my tithing diligently so I’m not free-loading (as much) on my subsidized tuition. Does anyone have any advice or insight?

EDIT: just to clarify, I am living every other aspect of the honor code. I feel sad and discouraged because my participation in the church for the most part has been to placate my parents (they have sacrificed a lot for me and my inactivity would make them feel like they have failed or that I am rebelling against them). This brings me sadness at church because I feel that on some level I’ll probably never have that child-like faith again and that now I’m attending for the wrong reasons.",

Both Provo and Orem have city councils that you can email and they will reply pretty fast. As for BYU is there a council or something?

There are multiple things that have really started to drive me crazy about BYU that seem like decisions made by people that don't ever have to suffer through them. The biggest one for me though is the off campus housing stuff that BYU has created. It is a system that has been around for decades and clearly doesn't work very well. I think BYU should remove their requirements to live in BYU approved housing. It has created a mess of once landlords get the title of BYU approved they just keep raising rent and caring less and less about the property and because BYU requires their students to live here there is no competition for them to get better. When I am forced to live with in a small group of apartments my ability to chose goes down. It's like only having 2 fast food restaurants in town. It doesn't matter how much they both suck if it is the only option you have, in the end you have to pick one of the terrible choices. I think BYU has created that with the off campus housing and now we have Redstone who is coming along buying up all of the real-estate and making it even worse for BYU students. Is there anything I can do to raise this to BYU's attention. I keep seeing post after post about their land lords did this or that. I also have a lot of beef about the housing contract that BYU has set up, there are a lot of things inside of it that should not be there or clauses that should be added.",

BYU has been sending me mixed messages regarding COVID and how we are supposed to deal with it.   My fiance and I have both tested positive for COVID-19 as of yesterday and are in NO condition to be attending classes for at least the next week, possibly two. Both of us have classes that require in-person participation and do not offer Zoom options for students who are sick or have COVID-19. We have contacted the professors of our respective classes and the response has overwhelmingly been to just collect notes from our classmates and take the hit on our participation grades. For 2 of my classes and 3 of hers though, we know we won't be able to make up the material without attending and found out that we are likely to be dropped a half-letter grade in missed participation without the impact of whatever missed material we have to catch up on.

So this is my question: if BYU is concerned so much about the pandemic, why do they not require all professors to have a zoom option for their courses? We have been in a pandemic for the better part of 2 years now and it's astonishing to me that we can be mandated to stay at home and yet be punished for complying with BYU and the CDC's guidelines. What is even more frustrating though is the classrooms we typically attend all have been set up with tens of millions of dollars worth of microphones and cameras that were paid for with our tuition and tithing money to resolve this very issue, yet remain unutilized by professors who are ""over the pandemic"".  We are all tired of the pandemic, I understand that, but BYU is not a school that you can miss a week or two of and keep up good grades. I know grades aren't everything, but for students who are working to get into graduate school or beyond, they do matter quite a bit.

For other BYU students, have you had experiences similar to this one? Should we just attend classes, double-masked, and sit in a corner somewhere? Should this issue be brought up to someone? We can not be the only ones currently experiencing this issue, and what happens when students decide to attend sick anyways?

Thanks for reading if you made it.

TL;DR: BYU sucks at managing COVID-19 and supporting its students, ideas appreciated.",

Course material can always be scaled up and down. Things can be cut, and things can be put in the next class, should a student wish to keep studying that topic. So, I'm not buying the whole ""It's a lot of material to be covered in just one class"" routine.

Equals nearly a $100k 4-yr scholarship for BYU-Provo students, $250k for BYU-Hawaii. Lots of charts in this new series on BYU financials. We have a new series coming out, an informative analysis of audited BYU system financials.

First up: [a summary of Church subsidies & tuition and breakdowns of campus income & expenses from 2014-2011](http://widowsmitereport.wordpress.com/byu-tuition).

Lots of charts related to tuition and campus income/expenses. Enjoy!

The tithing subsidies equates to:

* 78% tuition scholarship for BYU Provo
* 92% for BYU Hawaii
* 31% for BYU Idaho
* 61% for Ensign College

Note: the data is based on audited financials, available online here:

[https://facdissem.census.gov/Main.aspx](https://facdissem.census.gov/Main.aspx)   (search by school name in the ""auditee"" field)

We estimate the BYU system subsidy is \~19% of the Church’s entire annual cash budget.

This is a huge financial investment w/ likely strong returns in the form of a generation of long-term tithe payers.",

Have you ever been asked these questions in Provo? Hey, I know we haven't talked at all, or you may not even know me, but I just met this AMAZING couple who is super-rich. They're teaching me about how to become like them. I'm not sure if you're up to the task, but next time I see them I can drop your name. Maybe they will want to meet you? Do you want to speed up your financial track?

&#x200B;

Ok, this has happened to me 4 times now. It's really starting to bug me/freak me out. Different people, one in Ohio and 3 in Provo. They ask you a ton of questions about your life and pretty much that's it. Then they will start to slide in references about how they have these mentors. This awesome couple just doesn't have to worry about money anymore. They spend their time as philanthropists. Helping people like you and them to do the same. Sounds great right? Here's where it gets weird. They usually ask to set up a follow-up visit (similar to on the mission). During the next visit, they just ask you more questions about your goals. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, you're starting to wonder what this is all about. Why is this person who barely knows you taking such a big interest in you?

What do your mentors do for a living?

Have you ever heard of information-based assets? That's what they teach me about.

Cool, I'd like to meet them.

Ok, but they are VERY busy and only take a few people on at a time. I can ask them if they would want to teach you.

What are they teaching?

It's not really mine to say.

What, did you sign a non-disclosure?

No, I just really respect my mentor. It's theirs to share.

Usually, if you press hard enough they will say that it takes 6 weeks before the mentor would be willing to share what they are teaching. They need to learn to ""trust"" you first. They want to get to know you.

&#x200B;

All of it's super creepy to me. They all seem to be the same kind of people. Summer sales bros who don't have any money (work at a dead-end job like at a gym). I also study sales techniques and they are using almost all of them to try to get me to meet their mentors. However, many questions still remain. What are their mentors teaching them, why are they so motivated to introduce me to them, how come if you're meeting with these super-rich mentors are you still a poor college student. Speaking of which all of them decided that college wasn't for them.

&#x200B;

Ok, this is getting really long-winded, but now that's it happened 4 times it's not an isolated event. They all say very similar things. Basically, have any of you had similar experiences? Have any of you gone farther down the rabbit hole than me? I'm not from Utah, maybe these groups are common knowledge. Either way, \^\^ if you're curious because I need answers. Every time they talk to me I feel dark and it makes my hands shake. Weird",

I’m sure you’ve heard a little bit about the residential treatment center industry, or the “Troubled Teen Industry.” Paris Hilton held a protest at Provo Canyon school in 2020. Bhad Bhabie went after Dr Phil for sending her to an abusive center located in Utah. 

I’m a BYU Psychology graduate and active Latter-Day Saint. Internship offices and advisors often recommended and even recruited for local residential treatment centers. After working at two between 2019 and 2021, I concluded that the industry (especially the centers in Utah) is rife with abuse. It’s an easy job to get, and looks “great” on a resume, but it’s not worth the malpractice and neglect that goes on. I’m astounded that BYU schools still help recruit for these places. The best professors I know told us to stay far away. Well-meaning but untrained BYU students have no business getting involved in inpatient psychiatric treatment.

I won’t put all the details about the industry here, but head over to r/troubledteens if you want more info. Look specifically for facilities like Center for Change, New Haven, Maple Lake Academy, Heritage, And Telos. Those are frequently posted as hiring on BYU job boards.

EDIT: Let me just add here: the anti-troubled teen industry movement has some very strong anti-mormon feelings. I can understand why. Most owners of these facilities are LDS, and most employees are well-meaning but uninformed and undertrained returned missionaries. Part of me hopes that by posting here, some healing can happen for those particularly angry at BYU or the church for continually feeding these places with employees that (intentionally or not) harmed them.",

“Update: Vaccination Status Report
BYU is grateful for the COVID-19 vaccination status reports received in the last week, but there are many students who have still not responded. This vaccination status report is required of all students who have enrolled this fall. Without an increase in the number of reported vaccinations from the campus community, BYU will need to take precautionary measures, such as requiring masks. Other measures may also be necessary.”

I haven’t cared at all if people get vaccinated. Maybe I don’t know the science well enough but it seems to me that the only people that are affected by someone not getting vaccinated are the anti-vaxxers. Someone else not getting vaccinated doesn’t have a huge influence on my ability as a vaccinated person to get sick. And the amount of people that can’t get vaccinated because of allergies is incredibly low. So I’ve never really been mad about people not get vaccinated, I’ve just kind of thought they were dumb. But I can’t blame/judge/get angry at people for lacking intelligence.

However - if we have to wear masks because of it, I will be mad. I’ve never heard of a respectable person not getting the vaccine.  Everyone that doesn’t get it just seems like they are blinded by something. I thought once the literal prophet posted a photo of him getting it, people would start to do it. It is idiotic to think that everyone (including the prophet and quorum of the twelve) are being duped by the CDC. Or that because it went through a different testing process, it isn’t safe. 

We all want a good college experience again and if the anti-vaxxers are the ones who take my freedom to have that away, I’m going to be very upset with them. Besides the obvious one of being allergic to an ingredient in all three vaccines, I don’t care what their reasonings for not getting it are.",

I called in and they “accidentally” marked me as failing the final cleaning check; “the most expensive one” as said by the office manager. Luckily, my roommate had sent me a picture of the form after the check to show me I passed since I had already moved out by then. Now I can (hopefully) get my full refund back.

I will say that I don’t have any evidence that they marked me failing on purpose to keep more of the deposit, but it does seem pretty convenient for a housing complex run by a notoriously scummy contractor (redstone) to do that with a tenant that has moved out for good….

This is what I wish I knew way back when I was a smol 14-15 year old if I could do it all over again with the same knowledge I have now:

\-AP Credit is almost useless for a lot of classes. Don't take AP Lit (you've already taken AP Lang, so it won't help you), and don't bother with APUSH. The exams are nice for validation, but not nice for actually satisfying gen ed reqs.

\-When they tell you to ""experiment"" and take lots of different classes your freshman year, this doesn't apply if you want to go into engineering. Only take required classes.  (of course I wouldn't have known that I want to be an engineer if I hadn't taken different classes and figured out that engineering classes appealed to me most)

\-Deadlines and due dates actually matter. There is no mercy here.

\-You don't have to be smart in college, you just have to be diligent. Do your homework on a schedule and use a planner.

\-Don't take 8 classes in a semester, even if some of them are very few amounts of credits. There is a sweet spot at 3 credits where you get the most bang for your buck. Try to mostly take these types of classes. 1 or 2 credit classes are way too much effort, and 4 credit classes are usually specifically engineered to be a full-time job and drive you into deep depression.

\-Take spring and summer classes. They're easier and less work, and they're actually saving you money because you'll graduate faster. The only time you're better off taking a semester or term off is when you have an internship.

\-Make friends. This is just as important as doing well in class.

\-Make study groups early on. You may not end up meeting very often, but it's great to have a friend who you can text at the last minute when you aren't sure about something - and it feels great to do the same for someone else.

\-Go to career fairs, join clubs, and try to do all the networking stuff. It probably seems useless but it matters.

\-Don't listen to music while you study. No matter how much you try to rationalize it, it never helps you. Even if it's Bach or Mozart.

\-Don't ever let yourself compromise on sleep. You need to be well-rested for class- otherwise, you might as well not even go. You will learn that you cannot stay awake in class unless you've had your 7-8 hours.

\-Carve out time for fun on the weekends. You need to turn off the ""school"" part of your brain sometimes, and if you can't do it on a schedule, you'll end up doing it involuntarily at times when you can't afford to check out.

Background: I am related to one of the owners of a not-insignificant property management company (NOT Redstone, thank goodness) and I was talking to them about the change. Below is a summary of what I was told:

The major property management companies had a meeting and it came down to them asking Redstone what they were going to do. Redstone's response was: probably drop all units from BYU approval and increase rent prices. When the management company responsible for 30% of the rental market in the area makes a decision like that, guess what the rest of the companies who are in the same market decide to do?

Housing for freshmen is going to be ULTRA competitive for the off campus so a lot of freshmen are going to have to be in on campus. Additionally, (and some folks might choose to be offended by this) some of the ultra sheltered type that aren't used to their roommates being the opposite sex, drinking alcohol, and riding the bologna pony/slammin' the clam might have to do a little bit of growing up when they experience a light version of what the world outside of Utah looks like. And on top of that, goodbye are the days of getting out of your contract because you're getting married, going on a mission, or _________ reason that currently permits people to break their contract unless you are willing to take the companies to court and somehow have more money than they do.

There's going to be some other second and third order effects that people aren't seeing now, but it's certainly is going to bring a shake up to the Provo Orem housing market. Downvote me if you want, but I'm just telling you what was told to me.

While one could write a whole book about the perils and struggles of BYU dating cultures, I think one of the best things you can do to meet someone you might like is take an elective class. This idea also works if you are trying to get to know people. Choose something outside your major that you are interested in and not a core class for another major. 

 These courses could be classes like: 

*  Creative Writing 
*  Book Binding 
*  Floral Design 
*  Beginning Sewing Construction 
*  Introduction to Film 
*  An Unusual Language like Welsh 
*  Camping Skills 
*  Rock Climbing 
*  Fly Fishing 
*  Martial Arts 
*  Bowling 
*  Pretty Much Anything on the Student Wellness Catalog 
*  Stained Glass 
*  Intro to Sculpture for Non-Majors 
*  Folk Music Ensemble
*  And many more

 I have specifically avoided putting dance classes in here as they make trying to meet someone awkward. Likely because dancing is already seen as a way to meet people. 

 Anyway, by taking these classes, you'll meet people who share your interest but not your major. Because this isn't a class in your major, you'll find you are less stressed about the course and have time to get to know the people in the class. As it is a class you picked, you now have something to discuss with the people you are meeting. That gives you a step to build a connection and build a friendship. 

 It seems that people get caught in the grind of trying to date in their singles wards or just apartment complexes. Sure they are nearby, but the chance they are interested in the same things you are is lower. By choosing an elective, you increase your chances to meet people with whom you can connect. 

I will note, though, that you should make sure you have a legitimate interest in the class and that you're not just taking it to meet someone. That comes across pretty clearly and can be pretty creepy. Perhaps that's why the dance class dating stuff comes across as awkward.

 So that's my recommendation for students wondering how to meet people and make friends. These interesting classes give an opportunity to meet new people who already share an interest with you.",

She was a fellow at the Maxwell Institute and wrote the Brief Theological Intro to Jacob as part of their series. However, when I went back later to listen to her interview on the book (the Maxwell institute podcast interviewed each author in the series), they had removed it from the site and from all podcast feeds. All the other author interviews were still available. They had also wiped any mention of her from their website. I was unable to ever find out the reason why. Can anyone share some insight into how this happens and why in particular Green was removed in this manner?",

Everyone knows BYU housing has problems, but it’s time we have a real discussion about the root causes.

Here are a few excerpts from “The Provo Housing Racket” that summarize our findings pretty succinctly:

—

Too often, BYU students are over-charged, abused, and taken advantage of by their landlords. And, despite good intentions, BYU is one of the greatest culprits behind Provo’s broken student housing market.

BYU places significant hurdles in the way of would-be landlords, limiting the supply of available housing and costing students more. First, BYU contracted apartments are required to physically segregate male and female designated units. Since most apartments in the U.S. are gender-neutral by default, a large chunk of housing is written-off on that basis alone. Second, BYU contracted apartments must be located within a certain distance of campus, limiting the geography for BYU housing to a mere 2.7 square miles. That area includes established businesses and married housing, as well as streets and greenspace.

As a result, many BYU apartments are thirty, forty, even fifty years old. Building new is expensive, and the pool of non-BYU contracted housing within the zone is limited. Most newer developments are on the premium side of the market (The Village, College Place, etc.). If students had a wider range of affordable options to choose from, rent would fall and quality would rise.

It’s bad enough that BYU has built a system primed for exploitation—a system where the rules of supply and demand no longer apply, and landlords can count on a captive audience of vulnerable renters. What’s worse is the way that BYU has abandoned its responsibility to protect students. Last winter, BYU moved classes online and told students to go home. Students on-campus were released from their contracts in the dorms without penalties. Students off-campus, however, were left to fend for themselves. BYU did little to pressure complexes to release students from contracts, even though the university could have threatened to rescind BYU approval for non-compliant housing. 

If BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing with all of the drawbacks that entails—special rules, higher rents, lower quality—BYU needs to do more to protect students. This means:

No more 12-month contracts: require complexes to offer fall/winter contracts since most students leave Provo in April. 

No more monopolies: limit the reach of companies like Redstone Residential that exercise unfair control over the housing market.

Finally, pick sides: when crises like COVID-19 break out, BYU needs to side with students. The university has played neutral for far too long.

Or better yet, BYU should let students live where they want and let the problems work themselves out.",

Since transferring isn't really an option for me, I plan on being more open with my gender identity at BYU, and I've already came out to my bishop and a number of professors. Everyone has been pretty supportive so far, which I was not expecting.

Anyway, I wanted to get my ID card updated to reflect my new name and gender presentation. I was a bit hesitant, since I've heard quite a few cautionary tales of LGBT students and the Honor Code Office. I ended up emailing the ID center to verify that what I was doing was kosher.

It turns out that the ID center was totally cool with putting my preferred name on my card and dressing in feminine clothing for my picture. The person I emailed even asked what pronouns I wanted used for me so that when I went in I wouldn't get misgendered. So that turned out really well. Getting the ID card updated was pretty easy too, I simply walked in, took the picture, got my card, and left no questions asked.

In summary, while BYU can still be a tricky place for LGBT students to navigate, things are getting much better for us on campus. If you're a transgender student on campus, you should definitely still weigh the pros and cons of coming out of the closet. I just want y'all to know that (in my experience) the ID center is pretty trans friendly.",

So I let my facial hair grow and shave before tests. I hate doing this, because I want to let my beard grow out, so a couple weeks ago I met with the Associate Dean of Students Nathan Ward to discuss the issue of beards.

A quick summary of our meeting: that sucks, there's nothing I or you can do, have an ice cream on us.

In all honesty, my meeting with Dean Ward was very cordial and respectful. I went in knowing that people would have spoken with him before and intended on getting some ideas on official ways I can go about appealing it to people in power. And that's where I hit a brick wall. While I got the feeling throughout the meeting that Dean Ward was on my side and in total agreement, he explained to me in no uncertain terms that there's no way for me to directly contact those in charge of the Dress and Grooming Standards.

He also explained to me who's in charge of them: the First Presidency, Twelve, and a handful of other commissioners who meet to talk about the entire CES once a month. He told me that they were aware of the issues and that they were aware that student sentiment had changed. I asked if he could bring it up, he said that while they do talk about student sentiment about many rules that not even President Worthen can make recommendations on changes to the Honor Code: only the board can ask for recommendations. ie the prophet, his counselors, and 3 or 4 other people. The last time they asked for recommendations? 1991.

I asked him if he could see the policy changing while I'm at BYU (two-ish more years), he said he wouldn't be surprised, but that I shouldn't hold my breath.

After 45 minutes of discussion, I said ""it appears we've hit a brick wall."" Dean Ward chuckled sympathetically, and as a well-intentioned final act of placation, gave me two coupons for free ice cream from Cougar Eats, which I enjoyed with my wife.

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah, we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County, particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We’re concerned not only for your well-being, but also for those in the local community who are affected by the trends we’ve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes, work, church, and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren’t wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you’re feeling sick, stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus, may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result, follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks, more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine, closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely,

Kevin J Worthen, BYU President

View Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jw291e/the_problems_with_byu_contracted_housing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

In Part 1, we concluded that one of the biggest drivers behind BYU's broken student housing market is BYU itself. In Part 2, we will examine Redstone Residential and MHE Real Estate as a case study on the greater Provo student housing market. 

\_\_\_

Most students have no idea who their actual landlord is, and unmasking owners can be a lot like taking apart a Russian Nesting Doll—one shell company after another. Consider the Liberty franchise. According to Utah business records, the Liberty on Freedom complex is owned by Liberty on Freedom (LLC). In turn, Liberty on Freedom (LLC) is owned by Liberty Square West Investors (LLC) and Liberty Square West (LLC). Finally, Liberty Square West (LLC) is managed by **(name redacted to avoid doxxing)**, CEO of MHE Real Estate. A quick look through the MHE Real Estate [website](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/) reveals that MHE is a major player in the Provo housing market, despite the fact that the average renter has never even heard of them.

MHE at least partially owns: Campus Provo, Liberty Square, Liberty on Eighth, and Liberty on Freedom. These are among the largest BYU complexes by bed count. Liberty Square is actually the single largest BYU complex by bed count. 

While MHE owns the apartments, Redstone Residential (a real estate operating company) manages everything from leasing to maintenance and rent collections. In other words: Redstone is essentially a middleman between landlords and renters. Most operating companies take a percentage of revenues, driving up rent and disincentivizing any expensive maintenance or improvements. 

Residents we spoke to at Liberty on Freedom noted aged buildings, shared bedrooms, cramped kitchens, and a single shared bathroom. With utilities, rent comes out to about $400/month.

Before MHE and Redstone, Liberty Square had a vacancy rate of [30-40%](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/liberty-square/) during the summer months due to the nature of fall/winter and spring/summer length contracts. Now, Redstone-managed properties almost exclusively offer 12-month contracts, and vacancy has fallen to nearly zero. The burden has shifted from landlords to renters, and students are left scrambling to find replacement tenants for the summer months even though most BYU students leave Provo in April.

Redstone manages about half of all beds at the large BYU complexes and an even greater share of the overall market. Because BYU has kept the barrier to entry for new landlords so high, many students are forced to choose between one Redstone-managed property or another. And if it's not Redstone, it's likely Aspen Ridge. Small landlords are struggling to compete or even get BYU approval.

When COVID hit, the MHE-owned and Redstone-operated Liberty franchise was generally uncooperative with students trying to be released from their contracts or get rent reductions. Meanwhile, Redstone Residential received [between $2-5m](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/redstone-residential-inc-3cfaf714208b0bbd8de93d67b90a1a92) in forgivable PPP loans. 

When a few large firms monopolize a market, competition falls and consumers are made worse-off. Granting students access to the open market is the best way to promote competition and loosen the hold of companies like Redstone and MHE.

It's time for BYU to step-up and fix the broken housing market they helped create.",

Pro-tip: This is not the first time groups of people with different standards have had conflict.  So what’s the best way to deal with conflict?  Generally, when there is deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement, it’s helpful to agree to disagree.  

By the way, “deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement” is exactly what this is.  This isn’t Handmaid’s-Tale-style patriarchy trying to oppress you, and it’s not a progressive conspiracy to make you gay.  It’s decent people who genuinely hold one set of values disagreeing with decent people who hold a different set of values.  For the most part.

I have many friends and acquaintances from across the political and social spectrum, and we agree to disagree a lot.  I don’t love the fact that abortions occur, but I have good friends who are one-issue pro-choice voters.  I don’t think Islam is the devil’s scourge, but I go to family reunions with plenty of people who do think that, and I love them dearly.  I think socialism is an atrocious idea, but I haven’t blocked any of my Bernie-loving friends on social media.  Why?  Because we agree to disagree.  We share our opinions, we exchange ideas, and when the day is over, we shake hands and go back to our corners.

By the way, letting the other side “go back to their corner” is an essential part of agreeing to disagree.  Even though I’m pro-life, I’ve never chased an abortion doctor back to his house and picketed his front door.  Because that’s his house.  Even though I’m anti-anti-Islam, I’ve never gone inside my cousin’s rural Baptist church and shouted that everyone needs to stop sending money to Israel and be more open-minded about Islam.  Because that’s their church.  Even though I’m pro-gun, I’ve never gone to a meeting of Moms Demand Action with a firearm slung on my shoulder.  Because that’s their meeting.  Agreeing to disagree means you listen quietly, you state your case, and then you respect the other side’s autonomy.

In summary --  Even if you think homosexuality is a bad idea, don’t go to a gay bar and preach at people.  Nobody forced you to go to the gay bar, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave the people in the gar bar alone.  The gar bar doesn’t exist for you.  And even if you think homosexuality is just fine, don’t go to BYU and protest.  Nobody forced you to go to BYU, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave BYU alone.  There are plenty of universities that don’t think there is anything at all wrong with homosexuality.  Like, ALL OF THEM except BYU.  

I’m NOT saying, “If you don’t like BYU's standards, go somewhere else.”  I’m saying, if you don’t like BYU’s stance on homosexuality, that’s fine!  Stay if you want to.  It’s fine that there are communities that you don’t like.  There are communities that I don’t like.  We don’t have to change everybody we disagree with.  Let BYU’s standards be BYU’s standards.

Respect the fact that different communities see things differently, and leave them alone to do things differently.",

I was rejected from BYU just about two years ago. I was a convert with a 36 and a 4.0 and I was left feeling shocked and very hurt. I attended another university for a semester, reapplied with the exact same application, and was ultimately accepted for Winter 2019. 

College admissions is a really fickle process. I don't know why you were denied (and if my experience holds, you will never receive a reason...) but I do have a firm belief—bolstered in large part by my rejection experience—that God will aid us in making the best of these twists and bumps in our life plans. I'm sure I could be in a fantastic place in my life right now had I been accepted the first time, but I also know that my life would be drastically different without the attributes I refined as I weathered this ""trial,"" the amazing friends and faculty with whom I connected at my other university, and the people I met here at BYU only because I arrived when and how I did.

Unfollow BYU on Instagram for a few months if you have to, but keep doing all of the wonderful things you did in preparation to gain admittance and striving to be the best person you can be. Whether you wind up here in Provo next year or head elsewhere for higher education, I promise you're going to be okay. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to. :)",

Despite following all of BYU's mask and social distancing standards both on- and off-campus, I developed some COVID-like symptoms over the weekend. Per the instructions at [health.byu.edu](https://health.byu.edu) and on the Health Together app, I started self-isolating right away and I called the BYU COVID-19 hotline (801-310-0438). Since it was the weekend, they weren't open, so I left a message and received a call back first thing this morning.

You have to have an appointment to be tested at BYU. When they called me, they gave me several timeframe options during the day. You can either walk up or drive through. Masks are required. I walked since I don't have a car. When I was there this morning, it already seemed pretty busy with a few other people who walked up and 10-15 cars in line waiting to be tested. The whole process took me 5-10 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I left.

There is a tent at the front of the Student Health Center where you give them your name to check in. They took my temperature, and after waiting for a few minutes, one of the doctors administered the test. Yes, it involves sticking a q-tip type thing far up your nose, but at least for me, it wasn't painful and just tickled. They told me I should expect to get a phone call with the test results on Wednesday.

I'd imagine things will only get busier as the semester continues, so it's probably best to be proactive about getting tested even if you start experiencing even the slightest symptoms. I hope everybody stays safe!",

Anyways, I’ve seen a lot of people share online President Worthen’s letter about COVID spread at BYU. From what I understood, even small group gatherings outside of class and church are discouraged. I’ve been invited to some small group social events this weekend, and I’m not sure how to approach my friends and say we shouldn’t even be getting together without sounding self righteous and dumb.

Theory: BYU told the professors to give everyone more hw under COVID precautions.

My guesses why: 

A) To make us feel like we are still getting our money's worth in spite of less in-person interaction.

B) To keep us stationary. If you are busy doing hw all the time, you'd think people would be less likely to move places, go on dates, hang out with friends, etc. Could this be a bit of...um...encouragement (cough* manipulation*) to comply with COVID precautions?",

It was an upper-level CS class, and I was swamped with school and work and made an incredibly dumb decision on one of my projects.

I understand that I may have some harsh consequences coming up, I am going to meet the professor over Zoom tomorrow. Sorry to post this here, I am just distraught and wanted to ask if any other students at BYU have gone through something like this? What were your experiences? Did you survive (I know it is a silly question, it just feels so earth-shattering right now)?

I have worked so hard  in my undergrad  and it is terrifying to think of what this may do...

&#x200B;

EDIT

So, one of the most stressful times of my life is now over and I honestly feel like a better person for the experience. The professor was incredibly kind and understanding, and assured me that life will go on. I felt guilt and stress about copying code for that project for months, and allowed it to hurt me, and I encourage any others who may be in a tight situation to never copy code/cheat/take the shortcut. Reach out to your professor, they are surprisingly understanding, before you make a bad choice. If, like me, you have already made the choice, try to do the honest thing. You will feel better afterwards.

&#x200B;

If anyone is a CS student and struggling in a class, feel free to reach out to me. I may be  able to talk through a  concept you are not understanding for a class, or something similar. If nothing else, I am willing to talk!",

It’s just a personal rant that I just want to get off my chest. In no way do I like to point fingers at anybody specific. 

I had a friend recently that was posted on a social media page where they denounced him of not wearing a mask. He just had it off for a couple of minutes to get that dampness off of his face. He wasn’t speaking to anyone, nor did he have malicious intent. I know this because I was there with him. And yet, people on the media treated him as if he was some sort of criminal. I would’ve understood if the person who posted the photo would’ve approached us and gave him a friendly reminder. But we received no such warning. Now, I don’t want to say who is wrong here. My friend, who is not wearing a mask, is at fault, but did he deserve such treatment? I also cannot agree. 

I’m personally not religious. But, I was a little surprised by how some, perhaps only minority, choose to act in these desperate times. Some people put their views and politics first that they forget the vital part. I don’t think most of the students have malicious intent to spread the virus. I just don’t know if pointing fingers at each other and determining who is right or wrong is the correct thing. I was just a little upset to see that some students in a heavily religious school like BYU like to blame or watch other people being accused. I understand that it's frustrating to see others, not 100% complying with the rules, but I also don’t think Jesus Christ would have reacted the way some people are reacting. 

There are just some personal thoughts that I wish to share with the community. I'm completely okay with people sharing different views or even disagreeing. 

I know most of you are great people out there. I hope you guys keep doing great things!",

The Off-Campus Housing Office is experiencing a heavy volume of inquiries concerning the contract release process. We are asking student’s to communicate with their landlord’s or the landlords’ agent(s) concerning release.  The OCHO recognizes that the contract is a legally binding agreement between the landlord and the student.  However, the OCHO strongly encourages landlords and their agents to consider the value of releasing students. 

BYU has encouraged students to consider leaving campus and return home to finish Winter semester through remote coursework. We recognize individual circumstances may not allow this. (See www.byu.edu/coronavirus for more information.) The intent of this announcement was to allow students the option, when feasible, to improve social distance in the community and their living environment, thus slowing the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. 

Please be advised that in the event the community experiences a high volume of infected and sick students, the landlords will be required to follow the direction of state and local health departments.  By agreement, landlords will be required to quarantine and isolate students.  Landlords will need to provide housing to those impacted, which may include providing quarantined housing to affected students who can no longer reside in their own apartments.  The OCHO asks that landlords carefully examine the risks associated with keeping all residents under contract.  The university will not provide solutions to housing dilemmas which may arise in your properties.  You will be responsible, by contract, for meeting the needs of those students under contract. 

The landlord contract states (#18): “Landlord agrees to maintain the facilities in accordance with all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws or ordinances and with the applicable Minimum Specifications for BYU Contracted Off-Campus Housing shown in Section 20 of the Handbook. Landlord agrees to comply with any reasonable requests of the BYU Off-Campus Housing Office relating to the safety or general welfare of tenants, and correct any failures to comply with such laws, ordinances, and specifications in a reasonable time.”

See Section 16/Management Requirements; Section 17/Respond Promptly to Problems; Section 20/The Minimum Specification in the Off-Campus Housing Handbook. (https://och.byu.edu/landlord-resources)

We ask that you carefully consider the importance of assisting the students during this extraordinary time. 

Respectfully,

The Off-Campus Housing Office",

In my haste, I wrote the wrong conditions in the problem set-up, but still solved the problems correctly.

After class, the professor called me into his office and said he suspected me of copying my friend's homework. I denied it, saying we had done the assignment together and I just mistranscribed some information from the book. ""Here's an idea,"" I said, ""why don't you give me a ILD problem now to prove that I'm not just copying?"" He smiled. ""That's exactly what I'm going to do.""

He reached under his desk and handed me a paper with a problem on it. I sat down and solved it in just a few minutes.

He examined it. ""Okay then, never mind. You're free to go.""

BYU is chapter 20! Hey everyone, this is the first time I've shared anything about my book on the internet, and I'm sharing with the BYU subreddit because you all were the friendliest students when I visited.

When I was 20 years old, I went on a year long road trip around the USA to try to document the ""college experience."" I spent one week each at 23 of the nation's most interesting campuses. At each school, I would find a random student who would agree to host me. I'd sleep on their couch, go with them to class, sit next to them while they studied, and go with them to parties. Each chapter tells the true story of one week in the life of that person.

The BYU chapter has been a favorite chapter for many early readers. A lot of the book focuses on the partying, drinking, and hooking up that happens at most college campuses. But BYU was a completely different experience, and it was my happiest week out of any school.

I personally think that the BYU chapter of this book is one of the best explanations of Mormon culture for outsider readers who don't know much about Mormonism. A lot of my friends who aren't religious have read this chapter and told me they wished they could move to Provo.

You can read the beginning of the chapter here. [https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt](https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt)

If anyone wants to read the full chapter, just PM me. I'd share the full thing here, but Amazon only allows me to put 10% of the book for free on my website.

I'm curious to hear feedback!

My experience writing President Worthen I previously posted [this summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/em3vln/my_experience_meeting_with_an_associate_dean_of/) of my experience of meeting with Dean Ward. After that meeting, I left frustrated because I was essentially hitting a brick wall. I considered writing President Worthen then but decided that it would be fruitless at best. After an incident at the Testing Center, I was rather in a huff and decided to write President Worthen himself. I wrote a respectfully worded email. I wrote, after an introduction:

>I believe that an update to the Dress & Grooming Standards is overdue, and I have the vast majority of BYU students and my own experience in professional settings to back me up. The part that the I and the vast majority of students think should change is the beard ban. The beard rule has been in place for almost 50 years now \[this was a typo, I meant to type ""60""\]. My parents weren't even alive then, and they have multiple grandchildren. Times have changed, and the beard rule has gone from being a symbol of the professionalism and conservatism of BYU to simply embarrassing the school and by association the Church that sponsors it.

I then offered to meet with him to discuss my concerns further and gave him my contact information. Then I waited.

I received this response today:

>I understand your interest in changing the bead rule, but it is not currently a priority issue for the University.   We are focusing our efforts on things such as giving students more opportunities to be involved in research, internships, study abroad and other experiential learning activities; increasing the number of students who can come to BYU, and providing more opportunities in limited enrollment programs.  I would prefer to use the energy we have to advance those and other educational priorities.   
>  
>I wish you well in your educational endeavors.

So there you have it. I honestly didn't even expect President Worthen to respond to my email, and I can respect his response. I still think the beard rule is stupid and only damaging to BYU's reputation, but with other problems the school has I can respect that it's not priority. Hopefully one of these days someone says  ""why do we still have that rule?"" in a meeting and it finally gets changed, but I'm not holding my breath and I don't think there's anything left that anyone can do. It's up to them to act, and it's just not something that they care about right now.

EDIT: some of you might be wondering why I care so much and why I've been willing to put my time and effort into getting the change. I think facial hair greatly improves my sense of masculinity and therefore my personal confidence. It makes me look older, more distinguished, and more mature. In talking with other men I've found that they feel the same. I also love BYU and think that the beard rule is a dark spot on its reputation.",

I'm sorry for making a post about the honor code, but it's been on my mind a lot recently, and I'm curious to hear what everyone's current opinions are regarding the Honor Code Office. It was such a hot topic of debate before COVID and I feel like a lot of issues never were resolved.

Personally, I have mixed opinions about the HCO.

First off, I love BYU's honor code and think it's awesome that the university encourages its students to live at such a high standard. The honor code sets BYU apart from other universities and creates a tame environment for LDS students seeking to be educated and spiritually uplifted.

The problem with the HCO, however, occurs when a student slips up. Unlike the gospel, which teaches that no one is perfect and repentance is possible, the Honor Code Office expects its students to be perfect. The HCO is unforgiving, and one mistake can lead to huge negative consequences in that student's education.

**In this, the Honor Code Office basically incentivizes its students to procrastinate repentance.** Even though a student may have the desire to repent of their mistakes, they might wait to do so until graduation out of fear of being suspended or expelled from school. There are other options, such as taking a year off of school and transferring schools, but these are pretty huge decisions that can be avoided if the student chooses to just stay quiet.

Now, of course, before attending the university, all BYU students are required to sign the honor code. I honestly believe that the majority of these students attend with the intention of abiding by that code as well. The reality of the situation is, however, that NO ONE is perfect. No matter how good their intentions, people are bound to slip up because we are human. I'm not saying that the HCO should allow for students to completely disregard the Honor Code. I am arguing, however, that the HCO should follow the example of our Savior and be forgiving towards the students who seek repentance and change. If a student breaks the honor code and begins taking the steps necessary to repent, I think that he/she should be allowed to continue attending the university.

**The Honor Code Office is great, but it could stand to be more forgiving towards its imperfect students.**

Anyways, those are my thoughts on the subject, but I am curious to see what everyone else thinks of BYU's current Honor Code Office policies?",
