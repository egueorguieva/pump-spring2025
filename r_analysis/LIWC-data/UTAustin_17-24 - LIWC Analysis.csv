Yes, this was originally and still is about a pro-Palestine protest, but this has also quickly turned into a complete violation of constitutional rights and excessive display and use of force.

That is something that cannot be understated.

This protest was entirely peaceful. Nobody threw anything, nobody broke anything, nobody looted anything, nobody assaulted police. Simply walking and chants. 

WHETHER OR NOT YOU ARE PRO PALESTINE, PEOPLE’S 1ST AMENDMENT RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED. STUDENTS WERE ARRESTED FOR BEING ON THEIR OWN CAMPUS. THEY BROUGHT DPS IN FROM HOUSTON, HORSEBACK OFFICERS, MOTORCYCLE OFFICERS, COPS SUITED UP IN RIOT GEAR TO INCITE VIOLENCE AGAINST STUDENTS. UNARMED, HARMELSS, PEACEFUL COLLEGE STUDENTS. 

THEY ARRESTED AND SHOVED TO THE GROUND A FOX 7 CAMERAMAN. HE DID NOTHING. IT’S ON VIDEO. ATTACKING THE PRESS IS FASCISM.

This cannot be the end of this. UTPD, APD, DPS, Greg Abbott, UT Admin, all need to be held accountable for this. 

After today, I have lost complete faith in this University and its leaders.

* Protests of nearly equal or even larger size have occurred with a small UTPD presence and resulted in 0 arrests or disruptions (such as one on Nov. 9). Students attending reasonably expected they were acting legally.
* Student protestors planned a peaceful ""sit in"" in a public, outdoor, and spacious part of the university complete with guest speakers and study breaks.
* State Troopers showed up at 11:40 in riot gear when the protests hadn’t even began, so they couldn’t have been responding to violence.
* State Troopers let people march for an hour on speedway (basically just a massive sidewalk on campus) and randomly declared the march illegal at 12:40 for ""blocking a roadway"". They ordered people to disperse but also blocked people from leaving.
* When people then moved to south mall to not block speedway, they then declared all of south mall illegal to be on. They pushed the crowd onto sidewalks and created a danger of students being trampled
* Students got an email from UT Austin that declared anyone in the south mall area to be a rioter at 5:18pm
* After fencing the normally publicly available south mall off, police jumped over their own fences to arrest random people not on the mall, but on the sidewalks. They arrested compliant students, a Fox News journalist, an elderly protestor, and shoved around many professors.
* Troopers then declared the entire sidewalk off limits, and pushed the students from the sidewalk onto a street, blocking it off with a line of bike cops and horse police.
* For the first time in the day people students were actually obstructed, but not by protestors: UT staff and cops banned anyone from south mall, it’s sidewalks, and blocked a street off next to it with bike cops. If they tried to get to class using any of these routes, a cop (not a protestor) might slam them.
* The state troopers and APD randomly left around 7pm. (I have no idea why they would turn their backs on “violent rioters” without being attacked, calmly walk away, and let the ""violent rioters"" go back to a campus)
* Protestors returned to the south mall after 7pm. They did the same thing they would’ve done if the police never showed up: sat on the mall chanting while people freely walked by.

Why did all of this happen? This was an unconstitutional political stunt by Greg Abbott. He sent the troopers in advance to disrupt any pro-Palestine events on campus, even if legal & peaceful.

They didn’t just wait until violence occurred before sending riot police. Because they knew violence likely wouldn’t break out, and therefore they wouldn’t have a reason to arrive.

They didn’t simply order police to arrest violent individuals, because there wouldn’t be any, and they wouldn’t be able to disrupt the event. This is why they declared an entire area illegal.

This was a pre-planned attempt by UT Officials and Abbott to silence people peacefully protesting. Abbott said it himself on Twitter; he believed UT students belong behind metal bars not because they hurt anyone, but he dislikes what they think. Abbott did this to score points with his party and donors.

Shame on UT officials for going along with this anti-constitutional political stunt and getting students heads slammed on concrete, people’s futures jeopardized, and professors shoved around by cops so Abbott could get some favorable headlines.",1,574,79.75,60.78,34.03,4.9,20.5,23.34,84.32,61.67,49.48,7.84,4.7,0.17,0,0,0.87,3.66,3.14,11.32,7.49,2.09,15.68,5.92,4.7,7.67,2.61,12.72,4.7,2.79,6.62,1.22,0.7,4.7,11.67,0.52,11.15,1.22,2.09,1.57,3.31,0.35,3.66,0,3.66,0.87,2.79,1.22,0.17,1.05,0,0.52,0,0,13.41,3.66,0.17,0,1.57,0.17,2.96,9.93,0,0.17,0,0.87,0.7,0.52,0,0.17,5.05,1.74,0,3.31,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.17,4.01,10.8,0,2.79,7.67,0.35,0.17,0.17,2.79,5.92,0.7,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,18.12,5.05,4.36,0.17,0,1.92,6.62,0

A friend went to the jail, and they said it could take between 24 and 48 hours to process all of the arrests.

Do any of y'all have any insight?

UPDATE: As of 9 ish this morning (May 1), he was released. 

2nd update:  He graduated.   🎓  He's got a solid job,  is off the payroll,  and is happily living life.

TBIs are somewhat cumulative.   He had a few in high school playing FB, a couple playing rugby in college.   And,  well,  this one.   Y'all can think it wasn't enough of a hit to be a brain injury, but based on obvious symptoms,  it clearly was.

This post is very long, and I'm sorry. Please bear with me. I have held off making this post for months, because after hearing stories of some of the cults on campus harassing/following/threatening people who leave, I didn't want to create any content that could be traced back to me. But I feel bad that I haven't said at least something. I hope that new or old students who are considering joining this group will see this post and at least be informed about what they are getting into. **PLEASE read this post through to the end if it could apply to you at all, because a lot of the problems with this group are fairly well hidden.**

I am a freshman. When I came to orientation at UT, I was extremely lonely. I tried to talk to people and got very cold responses. I couldn't make any friends, wasn't interested in parties at the end of the day, and generally spent most of my free time calling my family and non-UT friends. That was until, as I wandered around in Jester trying to figure out where I was supposed to go, a friendly guy came up to me and asked if I was lost. He pointed me in the direction I was supposed to go, and handed me a flier for an ice cream social that CSOC was putting on. It sounded fun, so I decided to go. Everyone there was very kind, although they did immediately ask for my name, phone number, email, and home address on an ipad on the way in. I felt accepted. The students there literally sat in a circle around me and talked to me for hours. I was tangibly the center of attention lol. Sounds narcissistic, but it felt nice after what felt like constant isolation since I had arrived. Later I noticed them asking every freshman they could if they were lost and handing them a flyer, which slightly weirded me out, but I didn't think too much of it.

Literally 6 or 7 people from the group wrote me when I got back to my dorm that night. I set up lunch with two of them one day, and ""Bible studies"" (a misleading term) for the rest of orientation. Free food. Constant texts from people I now saw as sort of friends. Friendly faces around campus. It was great! Something felt a little off about how invested this group was in me, but I pushed it aside. As I returned home, I kept getting texts, and a couple of the older members said that the org was divided into many smaller groups that did Bible studies together. They asked if I wanted to join theirs, and I agreed. We started calling every night, fairly late and for a long time (like 10 pm to 2 am sometimes, WAY longer than a normal Bible study. The Bible studies were structured like this: one of the older students would pick a chapter, and we would take turns reading verses from it. After each verse, the older students would all give (suspiciously identical) interpretations of what it meant, and I was sort of just supposed to listen and ask questions if I wanted.

Here is the most important part. I kept noticing that things they read from their Bibles were different from mine. My translations is very standard (ESV) and I have read the Bible many times. I also competed in speech and debate (including Apologetics, a theology-based event) throughout high school. I know the Bible very well. So I was surprised to notice that a large amount of the verses they read were slightly, but meaningfully, different from what I was reading. I brought this up, and they told me ""Our version is similar to the ESV, just more accurate."" Their version is something they called the ""Recovery Version,"" a translation that no Christian reading this will likely be familiar with. More on that later. I asked them if that meant my Bible was wrong, and they said ""no, but ours is for people who want to know the truth more deeply."" They basically told me that my Bible left things out and was for beginners who aren't enlightened yet. This is deeply troubling and also heretical because the Bible is supposed to be the inspired word of God. These are translations, not different books. But theirs was more correct than mine? They strongly encouraged me to buy one of these, which are only sold by ""Living Stream Ministries,"" every chance they got. They also made a point of having us read footnotes for every verse, which didn't add context like normal footnotes, but literally laid out an interpretation of the verse.

I was really bothered, however, when they told me that the Bible mandates there be only one church in each city that presides over all Christians. The passage they quoted from their Bible to support this was just *straight up* *not in my Bible at all.* The same verse said something completely different. They literally told me that denominations are sinful because they are causing division in the Church and creating separate religions. This is when I started digging. They had told me their group was nondenominational and had Christians of all types, from Catholic to Reformed. This isn't strictly true. 99% of the group goes to a church called ""The Church in Austin."" I thought this was just a quirky name, until I dug a little deeper. They literally believe they are *the* church in Austin. The only one. The others are all fake and evil to them. CSOC is a name that mostly comes up in connection with UT. But the group used to be called ""Christians on Campus,"" which is much more common. All of these groups are tied to a church called ""The Church in \[whatever city\]"" and all of these churches are part of a cult called the Lord's Recovery. When I confronted them about this, they straight up lied and said that they are not tied to any denomination, while still affirming that only their church was valid out of all the churches in Austin. This turned into a 6 hour cross examination of them by me, in which all of my lines of questioning inevitably led to them asking me to go with them to meet one of the elders and have him sort out my questions. Thankfully, a friend gave me the good advice to not put myself in more situations where they outnumbered me, so I did not agree to this.

After I got off the phone, I looked *very* carefully into The Lord's Recovery and realized I had dodged a bullet. They have some fucking insane beliefs. Their founders, Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, are considered to be the divine oracles of God and the footnotes they add to the Recovery Version are taken to be divinely inspired, basically scripture. They also more or less segregate men and women, with occasional events in which the two interact. The group believes in ""courtships"" within the group only, and approved by leadership only, so basically arranged marriages. They're to be kept secret until the two are engaged. The Lord's Recovery bought a $6 million cemetery to have their members buried in, because they consider others unclean (even other Christians, if they're not part of the group.) The ""Recovery Version"" is not a translation, but basically a group of people led by Lee and Nee correcting the Bible. This is when it dawned on me: the reason I was the only person who needed their Bible passages explained to me was that they were just indoctrinating me. Their ""Bible studies"" were a crash course on the basic theology of the group. Everything ended with another ""Bible study"" in which they prayed for me at the end. The prayer was bizarre and disturbing, and they literally warned me that their prayers are ""different"" before starting (not a red flag at all.) The prayer was basically one of them moaning a bunch of stuff, interspersed with ""ohhhhhhhhhh Lord Jesus"" or ""pleaaaaase, God"" from the other one. It sounds funny, but the other guy legit sounded like he was having an orgasm the entire time. It was freaky and kind of comical. I GTFO after that prayer and told them I wouldn't have time for more Bible studies until after classes started. As soon as I moved in, I had CSOC members asking where my dorm was, what my dorm number was, and whether I wanted them to bring me housewarming gifts. They also invited me back into the Bible studies, which of course I declined. This kept going for over a week and I eventually stopped responding. A little while later, so did they.

The group boils down to a recruiting wing for The Lord's Recovery. After you graduate, if you stick with the group, you are expected to go to an expensive school at one of their churches for two years where you learn to be a clergy member in The Lord's Recovery, and the whole free food and love bombing system disappears. You are required to wear a suit at all times and prohibited from interacting with the opposite gender. Others have done long content on what it's like to be a member outside of college, I will link some of them here:

Edit 2: CSOC and the Local Church take PR very seriously. Don't believe them when they tell you they're not a cult. [this article from the cult itself](https://christiansaroundcampus.com/christians-around-campus-cult-or-genuine-christians/) accuses a 1990 Daily Texan article of libel and slander for calling them a cult. That same article calls the Texan an offensive, opinion based publication that pushes agendas, and cites a *now dead rival newspaper* as its source. Zero integrity, and real Christians don't lie like this. 

I'm kind of scared to see what happens after I post this. The last person who made a post talked about getting followed by members online and in person. But I felt I needed to tell the whole story. The problems with this group go far beyond UT Austin and the students here. I dodged a bullet from a group that has international roots and a history of sexual abuse, isolating its members, heretical teachings, and financial exploitation.

I even put “Female Only” for roommate matching. I called the Block on 25th East and they confirmed that I did put female only. However, they tried to turn it around on me and said “oh you should’ve known that you would be put into gender-inclusive room” when I never knew about it. I asked where in the lease it says it and they couldn’t tell me. 

They told me to email the block and I did. I was told they can try to switch me out but no guarantees. If they can’t put me in a room with all girls then can I break out of my lease? It’s unsafe for me as a girl only with all guys. I am even SHARING a room with a guy. Does anyone have any ideas? This is super unsafe and I have a partner.

EDIT1: Update: Got told I can’t break the lease even if they can’t solve this issue and they’re trying their best with room situation. Going to escalate even further now because why can’t they protect a girl if they can’t solve an issue like this?

Thanks all for the comments and suggestions! Escalation will happen.

I briefly spoke with them and they specifically mentioned that an event like this is important not only to promote joint and civil discussion on such a polarized topic but also to show students at UT that their two communities can still come together despite the immense tension on campus at this moment.

i wanted to rant something that has been pissing me off lately and get some things off my chest + ask for advice on what to do.

i am an avid basketball player and try to play at any free chance that i can. however, whenever i go to either the rec or greg, 5 times out of 10 the court is being used for some other shit like volleyball or pickleball. my question is, you can set up the net literally anywhere, but i cant take the basketball hoop and move it outside (i would do it if i could). so why must the volleyball people set it up at the ONLY place where i can play my sport. oftentimes, there are like 40 other people that want to play basketball but we are forced to share 2 courts because the other four courts are being used by volleyball/pickleball.

the reason i am writing this post is because i was playing basketball on halfcourt, just minding my business, when these two fucks came over, set up the net, and started spiking the ball directly at me. it hit me in the face twice and i was like please go ANYWHERE ELSE!!!!",1,214,29.06,1,80.69,33.26,23.78,15.89,88.32,70.09,62.15,14.95,9.35,8.41,0.47,0.47,0,0,5.61,14.95,6.07,3.27,12.62,11.21,7.48,7.94,0.93,18.69,3.74,2.34,1.87,0.93,0.47,0.47,18.69,0.93,17.76,0.93,3.27,5.14,4.67,0,6.54,0,6.54,3.27,2.34,1.4,0,1.4,0,1.4,0,2.34,5.14,3.74,0.93,0.93,0.47,0,2.8,1.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.01,6.07,0,0.93,0.47,0,0.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0.93,0.93,0,0,0,0,0,0,6.54,8.41,0,2.34,7.48,0,0,0,2.34,3.74,6.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,12.62,3.27,4.67,0.47,1.87,0,2.34,0

UT doesn’t have affirmative action based on race, it’s almost entirely the top 6% rule which allows anyone at the top of their class to get into UT , regardless of the amount of resources their school has. There’s also some affirmative action in employment based on veteran status and if you were in the foster care system (which is the law). Race is asked when you apply for a job but it’s just for documentation purposes. The people actually reviewing your application don’t see that.

DEI at UT provides support for people who need it the most in college. Including low income students, students of color, first generation students, and queer students because they are far more likely to drop out. Being at UT was the first time I had any kind of community for queer people of color and having that support is a large reason I succeeded at UT. You can read the statistics on your own but dismantling DEI is like dismantling disability support laws and removing the wheelchair ramps from campus or not letting dyslexic students use reading software. We start off on an uneven playing field and we need more support to get by.

Also you can’t just blame the laws for this because the departments that have been shut down *were* SB17 compliant. The MEC was SB17 complaint and it was shut down anyway. The GSC was SB17 compliant (it was merged with the women’s center) and it was shut down anyway. Which is particularly ridiculous because 90% of what the GSC was provide education on gender and sexuality. If college is supposed to be a space for learning why are spaces to *teach* being shut down?

And even if we’re being completely profit focused, this still hurts UT as an institution. Without support for marginalised communities there will be more minorities dropping out, so retention rates will drop. More people will fail classes, so 4 year graduation rates will drop. Rankings will drop. Less students will attend. Especially when the values of the university continues to show it doesn’t care about its students.

Especially with the change in tenure laws, UT is going to have a much harder time retaining talented students *and* staff/faculty. I’m personally moving out of Texas completely for my PhD because the actions of both the state government, and university leadership make it an unsafe place for me. And I don’t want to start a PhD at a place where my mentor could be fired at any point and I could lose years of work on my PhD.",1,460,53.41,51.73,27.24,32.27,19.17,18.91,90.22,67.17,56.74,10.43,5.65,2.17,0.65,1.74,0,0.87,4.78,13.48,7.17,1.74,14.35,11.96,5.65,7.17,1.74,18.48,5,5.22,6.3,1.52,2.17,3.04,13.26,0.22,12.61,0.87,3.48,1.96,2.61,0.87,3.7,0,3.04,1.96,1.09,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,10.65,3.48,1.3,0,0.22,0.43,0.43,7.17,0,0,0.22,0,1.09,0.22,0.65,0.22,8.7,0.22,0,8.48,0.43,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,0.43,0.22,0.43,0.43,0,0.43,0.43,0.43,0,6.09,9.57,0.22,1.96,6.3,0.87,0,0.22,1.74,3.26,5.65,2.17,0,0,0,0,0,13.48,5,2.17,0.22,0,3.26,2.83,0

Every now and then I would have someone who obviously doesn’t speak English hand me a card saying they’re a student at UT struggling to survive and need help. 

For one thing, it’s obvious to me that these people are not UT students. It’s ok to not know perfect English but whenever I try speaking back at them, they just give blank stares. How these people could be UT students while not knowing any English is beyond me.

Furthermore, it’s always different people but with the same MO. They all wear the same outfit and look like students. They all look like they’re in their upper 20’s or lower 30’s. Same pamphlet. Same “gifts” (crackers or cookies). 

I’ve also had this happen to me in multiple occasions in different locations. They’ve come to me in different floors of the PCL and even around midnight at the EER. 

Some are even a bit aggressive. Just a few minutes ago one lady of this group solicited me and whenever I had to respectfully say no (I’m hella poor) she left in a huff. On the 4th floor of the PCL mind you.

At this point I’m worried about their safety. It could be that these people are not even aware of what they’re doing and are being exploited by some exterior group.

This is creepy to me. I’ll make sure to provide pictures the next time they approach me.


Edit:
After doing some research using the additional information given to me from the comment below. We were able to track down one of the solicitors to a “news anchor” called Princess Laranas using one of the venmo handles they use for donations. This lead us to their official Facebook profile.

Princess Laranas is a news anchor for this group called SMNI News. SMNI is owned and operated by Swara Sug Media Corporation which is the parent company of Sonshine Media Network International. This company is the broadcasting arm for Filipino televangelist and church leader Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy.

Besides making grand claims such as being the “Appointed Son of God” and being the “Owner of the Universe”, Mr. Quiboloy was also accused of brainwashing a former church member, and was indicted for sex trafficking.

Mr. Quiboloy is the founder of the church “Kingdom of Jesus Christ”. This church practices tithing which has made Mr. Quiboloy very wealthy.

Besides that, the church is also guilty of human trafficking, abuse and are required to meet tithing quotas (which is probably why they’re soliciting us for money)

Where can I air these grievances to the University, that they may actually be heard? I know one person complaining will not change anything, but if other alumni see this and jump on board then maybe we can at least hope for change. 

To current students, I'm so proud of you. I'm not sure I would have had the balls at that age to stand up to militarized police. Hell, I don't have the balls now.

Domino has been wheezing and having trouble breathing for the past week or so. 

Although he is very resistant to trapping, [Cats of West Campus](https://www.facebook.com/catsofwestcampus/posts/4887666241287347) caught him tonight and took him to the vet.

He has an upper respiratory infection, which has affected his lungs as well. Unfortunately, he also tested positive for [FIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus). He was having trouble fighting off the respiratory infection due to reduced immune response from the FIV. 

It is pretty common for outdoor male cats to have FIV. He probably caught FIV at some point in the last few years (since his last vet visit) from fighting another male cat. He has had fight wounds a couple times in the past year. (We tried to take him to the vet to treat the wounds, but he was just impossible to catch. We treated him with antibiotic ointment and his wounds healed without requiring a vet visit.)

There were much more immediately dangerous possibilities, such as heart disease or cancer. His breathing sounded so bad, the vet warned me that chances could be grim. So I consider this diagnosis to be pretty good news. 

He is currently fostering with a UT employee, crashing in a bathroom so he can get some rest and medications. Hopefully the antibiotics will knock out this infection. He is in good hands. Huge thanks to his foster for doctoring him!

I paid $1,000 for the vet bill and will be posting a gofundme soon. God bless the fine folks at Pet Specialists of Austin!

The Domino Council has not made an official decision, but due to Domino's advanced age (approx 13 years old) and FIV+ status, I personally believe it is time for him to retire on a comfy couch. He deserves a happy retirement and easier access to vet care the next time he gets sick. Living outdoors brings many risks and dangers for any cat. He has had a good long run as undisputed King of the Campus. 

We will continue to keep you posted with any news. 

Get well soon, little buddy.

Long Live Domino!

I propose ""Shartzell"" instead, for a couple of reasons. 

1) Farts are benign and not all that embarrassing. Yes, Shartzell is loud, unexpected with his proclamations, and it all stinks. But that doesn't fully account for the mess and the cleanup involved when he flaps his sphincter. 

2) SEO. If you search ""Fartzell"" you'll only probably find that word. And if you search ""Hartzell"" you are unlikely to find results for ""Fartzell"". However, ""Shartzell"" contains the Prez's actual name and would mean that a ""Hartzell"" query would include ""Shartzell"" results. 

I could probably come up with a couple more reasons, but I'd love to hear from others and discuss. 

Let's make Shartzell trend for this man who invited DPS to our campus in a fashion that even GOP senators had questions about and over-complied with SB17 in order to lick boot. Abbott's favorite puppet deserves a name that fits. 

Not to mention the continuing layoffs over ""reputational crises"" because the Marketing professor can't manage the UT brand unless it's playing into culture wars.

Yesterday some friends and I who do not participate in this sort of thing walked to Cabo Bob's and had to pass Fiji's house. You could barely see the turf under all the beer cans strewn everywhere. Two cops were outside staring at the mess and barely said a word. The house and the nearby restaurants were surrounded with drunk guys and even drunker looking girls, swaying like they could barely stand and making complete fools of themselves. Trash is everywhere in West Campus and every group of people you walk by smells like alcohol. We watched people vomiting in a parking lot and saw kids who looked younger than us passed out on the side of the road. It's disgusting. 

This is all Greek life is good for. It is the worst part of American university life. That's the truth. I don't give a shit if this comes off as judgmental or self-righteous. That's because it is. Frats are horrible and abusive to new members and cause problems for everyone else, whether that's physical or sexual assaults, or bringing extraordinary amounts of drug and alcohol use to campus. Sororities funnel girls into a hierarchical pattern of social thought and are toxic and shallow, and their interactions with frats frequently end badly for the girls at these kinds of events. As someone else mentioned in a post a few hours ago, there are girls being abused at West Fest parties and turned away because of weight or looks. All this on top of West Fest's racist history and the poorly hidden histories of many of the orgs that it consists of. I would not be comfortable with my family being on campus right now because they would be horrified at the degeneracy and blatant sexism and horrible behavior. 

People say frats and sororities and parties are worth it because of ""connections"" and ""making a guaranteed friend group"" but that's a bunch of bullshit. If these are the kinds of people you want to be friends with or be connected to, your priorities are in the wrong place. West Fest and Greek life at UT (just like most elite universities, it's not just us) is shameful and detrimental to the school's environment. People who participate should feel embarrassed for partaking and the school should be embarrassed for endorsing it.

West Fest isn't fun. It's sad, pathetic, and trashes the campus. We should be better than this. 

Edit: I turned off post notifications and am not responding anymore. It seems the narrative has shifted to “you just didn’t get invited loser, go ahead and sit inside all day while rich people have fun.” This kind of criticism blatantly misses the point, as 1, yall don’t know anything about me, 2, needing to get wasted and demean women to have fun is actual loser behavior, and 3, West Fest/Roundup has been causing real harm to women, minorities, and random attendees who get caught in the crossfire for a long time. It’s documented. I don’t dislike it because I didn’t get invited. It’s hard to get invited to things you have literally no connection to or interest in. I dislike it because it is degenerate and has historically caused a lot of harm. I’m not making headway by responding to these people. If calling people losers for not wanting to pass out on the side of the road in our own vomit or get tased by frat boys makes y’all feel better, I feel sorry for you.

The amount of exclusion I’ve felt since I moved here is debilitating and has affected my academic life and ability to socialize. Coming here is genuinely one of the costliest mistakes I’ve ever made. In my time here, I’ve seen everyone go on and live their lives and love it and haven’t experienced even a bit of the fun they talk about. I’m making a broad generalization here but I’m fairly sure, my experience will apply to most black students here. You’ll start to think you’re the problem if you stay here long enough. The degree and job opportunities really aren’t worth it. I know a lot of will disregard this, whether out of lack of other options or something else, but if there’s even just one person who reflects on this and decides not to come here, I know I’ve at least helped one person out. 4 years is a long time of feeling like this so make sure you think twice. Worst thing about it is that nobody will care how you feel, your voice will be drowned out by all the other people having the best time of their lives while you suffer in silence. I realize this isn’t a problem unique to only black people but Austin is one of the most economically segregated cities in America and has a deep history of systemic racism rooting back to 1928 that still has great effects today so we’re affected in more ways than we can actually see or measure. Everyone’s experience is different, just wanted to voice out my experience for posterity and future classes who might come across this post. 

I only see all this getting worse after SB17. There’s a reason why African Americans are leaving this city at such a fast clip.

Mentally ill people, people with poor/no English, people who are isolated and seeking community such as exchange students.

They also love to create front groups that seemingly have no connection to Scientology itself. Some actual names of such groups are ""Youth for Human Rights International"", ""World Literacy Crusade"", and ""Computer Ethics Institute""

A more realistic scenario is that an exchange student applies for what he thinks is an internship and they ask for him to sign an interest form, take a uniform, and hold some key immigration/ID documents overnight to process his application. When he returns, they don't give the documents back and point to something buried in 20 pages of the form saying he will do hours a week of ""volunteer"" work for them. They also say the uniform they gave him is worth $2000 but he can choose to work instead of paying for it. If he calls 911 they just say they've never seen him before. (Actual story)

Another example could be a student who moved away from their family to UT to avoid their Scientology ties now finds themself being recorded and followed by Scientologists on the way to work or class since the ""grand reopening"" to pressure them to rejoin.

Saying ""just don't be an idiot and make wise choices"" doesn't suffice as a solution to stop the influence of a sketchy organization near campus with decades of experience of using legal trickery and harassment to gain members and harm people.",1,295,60.01,80.82,12.81,34.55,32.78,24.41,89.49,65.42,50.85,12.2,9.49,1.02,0.34,0,3.05,4.41,2.71,12.54,6.78,1.02,13.22,7.8,3.39,7.8,2.03,15.25,5.76,3.39,5.76,1.69,2.03,2.03,10.17,1.36,8.81,3.39,1.69,1.02,1.36,0,1.69,0,3.39,2.03,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,18.64,6.1,0.34,0,0.34,1.02,2.03,12.2,0,0,0,3.05,2.03,1.02,0.34,0.68,8.14,0,0,5.08,0.68,2.37,0.68,0.68,0,0,0.68,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,1.02,0,0.34,0,0.34,0.68,0.68,7.46,5.76,0.68,1.02,4.07,0.68,0,0,4.75,1.69,6.44,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,13.22,3.05,3.05,0,0,1.36,5.76,0

I was living in an apartment with my girlfriend (at the time) doing my homework, when suddenly she tells me “I found the answers to my chem midterm online and used them yesterday during it.” I was speechless, she could tell I was having a hard time processing this so she walked into her room to give me space.

During all this shock, I smelled something burning from another room and heard the apartment’s fire alarm go off.”Will! There’s a fire! Help!” I heard my girlfriend shout. Now I was stuck in a conundrum -- report her to the academic integrity office, or put out the fire in my apartment?

But all of a sudden, the smoke in my apartment cleared and the fire alarm fell silent. My girlfriend walked into the room, and to my astonishment, peeled off a wig and revealed herself to be Jay Hartzell himself! “Im proud of you for upholding and excelling Academic Integrity,” he said, and gave me a free HealthyHorns condom and a 'Make It Your Texas' sticker.

I was lucky enough to get EMS attention, even though their bitch ass made my fiancée pay for water WITH THE TIP SCREEN. The fucking audacity… my fiancee said “I have never pressed the skip button so fast.” I took some from their stash of cold water bottles for that. Fuck them.
Anyways, the ceremony was so badly managed that it basically became a hazard to be there. While I was leaving the medical area, my fiancée witnessed a group of people carry their unconscious friend and get rejected medical attention because they were full. 
Not only was the medical area severely understaffed, but the crowd control was also badly managed. Instead of having people in a line, security basically had people in South Mall packed like sardines behind a barricade; the perfect recipe for another AstroWorld incident. People were pushing each other, starting fights, and raiding the barricade. And the weed smell was very prominent and headache-inducing. 

Jay Hartzell wants to hire a SWAT team for a peaceful protest because he has “a responsibility to keep the campus and its people safe”, but can’t even staff enough security and medic to control this shit show of a ceremony. So much for keeping his word, am I right? 

Edit: Don’t be hyper focused on the fact that I almost fainted. I take responsibility for that and I’m in healthy condition right now for those who are concerned ☺️ Like I said, I was LUCKY and am thankful to even get medical attention. 
But y’all are missing the big picture here. My intention was to highlight my concern of how badly managed the event was, even to the point where security gave up.  Even someone’s daughter got trampled and her mother had to take her to the ER. South Mall was so packed that it was almost impossible to get out of. Even my fiancée who didn’t need any medical attention knew this was a hazardous situation to be in. This could have been mitigated if there was more staffing and better event planning. The event organizers should have expected this a while back when they were hosting a free, public event that had an international star. If anything, this could’ve have been a ticketed event. “bUt yOU sHouLd’Ve HYdRatEd”, okay thanks for nothing?",1,411,37.72,20.12,18.3,23.3,16.44,22.63,88.32,68.86,56.2,12.17,7.54,4.14,0,0.49,0.97,1.46,4.62,16.79,8.03,0.49,10.46,10.46,8.27,6.81,1.46,17.76,6.57,2.19,3.65,1.7,0.97,0.97,11.44,0.49,10.95,0.73,2.19,1.7,1.7,0.24,3.41,0,6.81,2.68,2.43,1.46,0.24,0.97,0,0,0,1.46,7.79,1.95,0.49,0.24,0.73,0,1.22,6.08,1.46,0.97,1.95,0.49,0,0,0,0,2.68,0.49,0,1.95,0.24,0,3.41,2.92,0.73,0.49,0,0,0,0,0,0.73,0.24,2.19,0,0.73,0.24,0,2.19,0,8.52,7.79,1.22,0.97,4.38,0.73,0,0.49,2.19,9.25,2.43,0.73,0.49,0,0.24,0.24,0,14.6,6.08,3.41,0.49,0,1.95,2.68,0.24

I had to rush to my class as I was late, otherwise I would’ve definitely held his arm and guided him all the way. He did have directions on his phone and would listen to siri for guidance. I wonder if he made it, his disability quadrupled the commute time. I also wonder what services UT offers for blind students like that?

This past Wednesday, UT President Jay Hartzell informed Ann Stevens, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, that he would not allow her to continue for a second term:

[https://www.statesman.com/story/news/education/2024/10/02/university-of-texas-dean-says-jay-hartzell-wont-let-her-seek-second-term/75488355007/](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/education/2024/10/02/university-of-texas-dean-says-jay-hartzell-wont-let-her-seek-second-term/75488355007/)

To add further perspective, at the end of August, Hartzell suddenly fired UT's top academic officer (his provost, whom he had chosen himself) and replaced her with the very inexperienced Dean from the College of Communications.

In her email to CoLA (College of Liberal Arts) department and unit managers, Dean Stevens wrote the following:

>Dear Colleagues:

>I am writing to let you know that Jay Hartzell informed me yesterday that he will not allow me to be considered for a second term as Dean.  The reason he gave was that I did not have a grand enough vision for the college.  While I disagree with that assessment, it is clear that he and I have different values and different goals for the college. 

>I am not yet sure of any details about the timing of appointing an interim dean or of starting a search. I have the option to serve through August 2025, when my term officially expires.  I will let you all know as soon as I have more information about plans for the next COLA leader.

>With your help, we have made enormous progress in COLA: building academic excellence; improving research support and infrastructure; investing in student funding, research, and career support; and supporting a culture of respect and care for staff, faculty and students.  I am attaching the two documents I prepared for my review.  They are not relevant for that purpose any longer, but I do hope they will reassure and remind you at this difficult moment of how well the college is doing. You should have no doubt that COLA is in a very good place today.

>I want to encourage all of you, as college leaders, to continue to focus on what is in the best interest of yourselves and your units, and to continue to carry out that mission through what will be another challenging transition.  I will do everything I can to help with that. This news feels terrible to deliver via email, and I am looking for a time in the very near future to be available for some in-person conversations.   I’ll be in touch.   Jay will apparently be emailing all COLA staff and faculty later today, but you should feel free to share the information in this note with your staff and faculty colleagues.

>Thank you so much for all that you do for the college. It’s an honor to work with all of you.

>Ann

If a Dean wishes to continue to serve in their capacity, it is customary for their performance to be reviewed by a committee composed of constituents of their College at the end of their first term. Dean Stevens makes clear that Hartzel **is not allowing that review to take place**, and he is doing so without any public explanation.

I've been seeing a lot of posts about what to do *inside* your home during this weather, but not much on what to do if you actually have to venture *outside* your home. So I'm giving my two cents as someone who managed to survive to adulthood in the north.

Here's the thing: the *number* of layers you have isn’t necessarily what matters. Wearing three pairs of leggings isn't going to feel much different than one pair of leggings. What matters is the *shape and size* of the layers. What keeps you warm is the air between your clothes staying warm.

Shirts: You're going to want at least two layers, but definitely more than that. Make sure that you have at least one layer with tight-fitting wrists and a close-fitting collar, because that will keep warm air in and cold wind out. If you're an athlete and you have those sweat band things that go on your wrists, those are a really good way to keep the wind out of your sleeves.

Shoes: If you have any kind of boot, now is the time to wear them. If you only have normal socks, wear two or three pairs of them. If you have those thicker fuzzy socks, wear those. Yes, even if they have funky patterns. The same rules apply if you only have sneakers, but godspeed soldier.

Pants: If you own leggings or tights, put some on under your jeans or sweats and you're good to go. If you don't (like me), pick your tightest sweatpants and baggiest jeans (or vice versa) and wear those with the baggy pants on top. Tuck your inner layer into your boots (if you have them) or your socks (if you're wearing sneakers). This way, you can keep the wind off your skin while your outer layer hides the fact that pants look really weird when tucked into socks or boots.

Other Accessories: Hat. If you don't have a hat, wear a hoodie. Gloves. If you don't have gloves, pockets. Scarf, wrapped around both your neck and face. If you don't have a scarf, dig out the face masks from COVID and wear those. It keeps the cold air off your face. Lastly, have space in your bag to put some of these layers once you get inside, because you might start sweating to death otherwise.

Coat: If you don't have a winter-ish coat, you probably have a polyester windbreaker or something. It might seem pointless. It's not.

I am editing this because ppl seem to believe my post is about defending myself. If you click the petition above, nothing about my activism involves clearing my name. Here is the statement you could read if you actually clicked the link:

This week I, an autistic student with 0 monthly income, was chased, harassed and then reported to authorities by an official dining employee for leaving JCL Residential Dining Hall with an 8oz cup of self-serve cantaloupe. Today I received an official accusation from The Office of UHD Residence Life for violating my housing contract by removing food from a residential dining hall without permission from an employee. Despite most generous dining hall employees allowing small items like cups of fruit, small plates of dessert and drink cups to be taken freely from the halls, this female employee has not only caused an immense amount of stress on my life, but also placed my future at this university at risk over a cup of “unlimited” fruit included in the $6782.88 I have paid for the “convenience” to live AND eat here.

The University of Texas at Austin currently enforces an unjust policy prohibiting students who have paid for a meal plan from taking food from a residential dining hall without first paying $7.50 per meal (on top of a base $5 program registration fee) to receive a to-go container with the Eco-To-Go program. Statistics show that 1 in 3 UT students face food insecurity, yet residents paying to live AND eat at campus owned dining halls are forbidden from saving “free” food to eat at a later time or at another location. With these policies, students without an income or access to groceries, or those who have run out of dine-in-dollars and bevo pay, do not have access to food during any hour that does not fall between 7am-9pm on weekdays, 7am-8pm on weekends, or during the 2pm-5pm preparation breaks that dining halls often take.

This dining policy–implimented in 2021 following the pandemic–which allows students to be reported for violating housing contract, is ludicrous and quite frankly, contradictory to everything UT Austin claims to stand for. The money hungry changes to dining rules made in order to promote the unaffordable Eco-To-Go program need to be undone. Please sign and share this petition to urge the University of Texas at Austin to allow students the freedom to eat the food they have paid for.

I have deleted the personal anecdote which was shared in hopes you would find comedic relief in the insane enforcement of a fruit cup AFTER reading the link I included. But since it is clear to me ppl are not willing to click links, I will make it easier for you.

If it’s your first year at UT and you’re not from Austin, you may have heard that homelessness is extremely bad in the city. Unfortunately, this is true. 

This post isn’t meant to dehumanize or bash any unhoused - especially those who are mentally ill. However, the recent heat wave is greatly exacerbating mental health issues and increasing aggression. It’s important to know which areas in the city to avoid.

You will not see many (if any) unhoused people ON campus - especially during the day. This changes the closer you get towards Guadalupe St. Please be careful walking down Guad at night - don’t be scared, just very mindful of your surroundings. Avoid the sidewalk area next to / behind Dollar Slice Club at night. 

In West Campus, there are some incidents every year along 22 - 25 Streets. 90% of the time, this is just an unhoused person going through a mental health crisis and screaming / making gestures at bypassers. It’s intimidating, but physically harmless. Don’t interact, just cross the road and try to pass as quickly as possible. 

There are many encampments in wooded areas. Be very careful while walking / jogging in Shoal Creek, Zilker or any Greenbelt areas. A large encampment is also in the woods behind the Starbucks at the Barton Creek and S Lamar intersection. Be careful around there. I’ve had several bad interactions both on foot and in a car. 

6th / 7th St is just flat out dangerous right now, both at day and night. AVOID THE UNDERPASS I-35 INTERSECTION THERE AT ALL COST! Generally, be very, very mindful of your surroundings while walking/driving downtown. 

Overall, please remember that the homeless are also people. Therefore, TREAT THEM LIKE PEOPLE! Many are very polite and will graciously accept any food / clothing that you can give. Don’t live in ignorant fear, just use your best judgment and be knowledgeable about the Austin area.",1,339,50.12,45.3,74.97,5.58,13.04,20.35,87.32,67.85,53.69,7.67,4.13,0.88,0,2.65,0,0.29,3.54,14.16,5.6,2.06,13.57,9.73,9.44,7.08,1.77,15.04,7.67,5.9,2.65,0.59,0.59,1.47,12.39,0.59,11.8,1.47,1.47,0.88,3.24,0.29,2.95,0.29,3.54,0.88,2.65,1.47,0,1.47,0.59,0.29,0,0,6.78,2.36,1.18,1.18,0.29,0.29,0,3.83,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0,0.29,2.65,0.59,0,1.47,0.59,0,3.54,2.36,0,0.29,1.77,0,0,0.59,0,0.29,0.29,0.59,1.18,0,0,0,2.36,0,7.37,15.34,0.59,2.36,11.21,0.29,0.59,0.29,3.83,1.77,6.78,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,19.17,7.08,4.72,0,0.59,2.65,4.13,0

But my friends and I went to the silent disco tonight at Greg. It was pretty low key, but enough people for it to feel safe and such at night. Plus there’s always some people out on speedway at night anyways. So my friend and I are chilling on the side and this guy comes over to sit with us. Initially he seems chill, kinda interesting, whatever. First red flag was that he didn’t even go to UT. He said he was giving his friend a tour of Austin and stopped by campus. Second red flag was that he was obviously significantly older than us and actually showed excitement (ew) when we said we were freshman/sophomores. Then, when we asked him what he does (since he’s apparently not in school), he literally says “you don’t want to know what I do.” Finally after a really awkward few minutes of him calling us “party girls” and “freshies” he asks if we want to go get smoothies?? We both don’t really answer and I think he FINALLY gets the vibe and says he’s gonna go find his friend (who he said was this dude dancing in front of us.) Well when he gets up he goes no where near his “friend” and actually just walks away to a nearby staircase where he sits down and stares at us. 

THEN a group of girls (who were the best people ever like thank you so much for checking on us) comes up to us and repeats everything he told us because he had tried the same lines/story on them JUST BEFORE US. Asking to get smoothies and everything. Lemme just say that gave me freaking chills. We waited for him to get up and leave before even considering walking back to our dorm. 

Anyways. This is tame compared to some situations, I get that. But I just had to say something because I’d never want to hear that some girl actually took him up on the smoothie offer and something happened. And no, there really wasn’t an option to “report” him or anything  as the whole thing was just students (even though I’m honestly thinking I should’ve done more). But just please be careful.

So I live in a house with like 7 other people (big house) and recently we had someone move in for the new semester. Our rooms are like suites and I share a bathroom with the new person. For like the last month or so I keep waking up or not being able to sleep at all because my housemate keeps grunting and making his squeaky bed rock all night. I thought he was working out so one day I asked him to not work out so late at night and he went ""I'm not working out."" I was confused but I just told him to keep it quiet after 11. But he hasn't. He keeps grunting. I was really curious so one night I pressed my ear against the door to his room and he was just going ""yeah, need to keep gooning. Yeah, yeah..."" and just kept grunting. I looked it up and gooning is apparently just like marathon jerking off??? I feel so fucking weird knowing I live next to someone who does this. Kind of afraid to bring it up to my housemates though.

So, last night there was an accident by cain and Abel's. A board fell from a building (I've heard the one directly behind Cain and Abel's that's under construction, but unsure) and landed on a guy's head, severely hurting him. Myself and a couple nursing students did our best to take care of him while the ambulance arrived— God Protect him but he was unconscious and not doing well. 

What I want to know, is who can I reach out to regarding the board? The board was massive, at least 50 lbs, maybe a hundred.  It was improperly secured— it looked like all that was holding it up was tacking nails hardly as long as the board was thick. I'm furious because I think whoever improperly secured that board is responsible— likely a construction company. 

Whomever was hit by the board deserves justice and compensation for what may be extensive hospital bills. I don't know if the patient is even conscious now, or what his situation is, so I think it would be good to reach out to some sort of authority to get the ball rolling on an investigation. Beyond that, he may be a student, so for various reasons (including the possibility the building was a university owned or affiliated apt) it'd be good for the university to know. Would it help to reach out to the dean of students? file a police report? who else would y'all recommend reaching out to?

I am a graduating senior and about an hour and a half ago finished up my last class. I feel nothing and everything at all. I still remember so much, and have gone through an incredible transformation over the last four years here. I wanted to write down my story briefly for you longhorns; I hope you feel comfortable enough to share something as well. 

I come from a small town in Texas, and about only four of our class came to UT. I roomed for three years with one of my best friends, and came into college in a relationships with my then girlfriend. We broke up mid-way through the first semester and it absolutely crushed me. I spent a lot of time isolating, lamenting and being dejected. I was a pretty bad person and so I felt like it was punishment for me to suffer and not enjoy college. I spent most of my time my first two years just studying. I did not make many friends, and the ones I did make I did not keep up with. I played in a sports club but I only made two good friends (still good friends with both). However, most of my time was miserable - I put on weight, struggled with becoming a better person, felt like I didn't deserve much and just wanted to suffer a lot. It was the only sensation I felt really strongly. I didn't have any friends to confide in and just didn't feel like it was worth it. Although this never hurt my studies - I really enjoyed my classes and felt like my professors were the best people in my life. Additionally, I spent much time reflecting and keeping up a journal (which I still do), and reading books. These two things kept me afloat, and actually made me a better person.  

But I realized that holding grudges against myself was wasting so much energy - I was tired of being so sad on purpose and living a miserable life. I started to eat right, work out in the mornings, took up a part time job on campus, and started saying ""yes"" to life more often. Life didn't change magically change or get amazing - but it did get better. I made a few more friends, got nice internships, expanded my network, stayed healthy, got back into my numerous hobbies, went out more and just...lived life. I never did anything I didn't want to, or felt pressured to do something. I made many great memories, and I am thankful for my pain because it gave me wisdom and through that I grew. I am proud of what my four years meant to me, even though it wasn't the most ideal. All my friends have been supportive in their own capacities, and I have grown close to many professors. Everything isn't fine and dandy, but it is better. 

And now it has all come to an end. I really don't know what will happen with commencement. I really don't think it will go through if I am being honest. I am upset my parents won't get to fulfill their own dream of seeing their son graduate and walk. Or that I won't get to take pictures with my professors and friends at graduation. I plan on writing a letter to every professor, TA, and friend that inspired me and meant something to me. This isn't the end of things though. I will also be back here for my dual Master's program, so I am very thankful I don't have to part ways with Austin and UT yet. This isn't the way I imagined it, but that is okay. I have achieved so much, and I have so much to achieve. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that those who read this also share their story - I would love to read it.",1,668,16.91,1.08,95.11,55.15,16.7,15.12,95.81,79.64,62.87,18.71,13.02,11.53,0.3,0.45,0,0.6,5.69,15.42,4.19,1.5,12.28,8.38,6.74,8.68,3.14,19.61,7.49,7.04,5.84,2.69,2.25,0.9,14.82,2.1,12.57,2.84,1.5,1.5,2.25,0.9,4.49,0.3,7.34,4.79,2.54,4.04,1.8,1.95,0,0.15,0.45,0,7.93,2.4,0.3,0.15,0.15,0.3,1.2,4.79,0.3,1.35,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0,4.94,0.6,0.15,3.59,0.6,0,1.5,0.75,0.15,0.15,0,0,0,0.15,0,0,0.75,1.2,0.6,0.3,0.15,0,0.15,0.3,10.18,7.93,0,1.35,4.94,0.45,0,1.65,3.59,8.83,3.29,1.2,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,15.42,6.44,4.64,0,0,2.25,2.1,0

Do well in your classes tomorrow, support each other, and hook em! 🤘",1,76,36.67,95.8,1.85,97.62,9.5,32.89,92.11,72.37,51.32,11.84,6.58,0,3.95,2.63,0,0,5.26,9.21,3.95,0,11.84,9.21,9.21,6.58,0,19.74,7.89,1.32,11.84,6.58,3.95,1.32,14.47,2.63,11.84,0,1.32,5.26,1.32,1.32,3.95,0,14.47,10.53,3.95,7.89,5.26,2.63,0,2.63,0,0,14.47,2.63,1.32,0,0,0,0,10.53,0,1.32,0,0,1.32,0,0,1.32,9.21,1.32,0,7.89,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.32,2.63,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.89,3.95,0,0,2.63,1.32,0,0,5.26,0,7.89,3.95,0,0,0,0,0,21.05,5.26,7.89,0,3.95,3.95,0,1.32

They illegally break leases late into the leasing season and try to take advantage of students who don't know much about the leasing process. They're basically running a scam operation over there. They'll countersign your lease in September, take your fee and security deposit, then send you an e-mail over winter break telling you that they oversold and that you're SOL. At this point in the leasing season, all the good places are full, and the remaining places have jacked up rates. They do this every year to tons of people. I made a website that details everything, https://austinuniversityhouse.com.

I demanded that they give me the difference in lease rates between them and the new place I had to sign at, $2880, and after a ton of back and forth, they demanded that I take down the website, withdraw all my reviews and complaints as resolved, and never speak about it again before they'll give me that. I told them I would do that after they offered compensation to everyone they did this to, and they refused. They tricked a bunch of people into signing forms saying it was a mutual termination. So unfair that they're taking advantage of students who don't know much about the leasing process this way.

I hadn't intended my original tweet to get nearly half as much attention as it did, when I asked if anyone wanted to join it was half me making a joke, half me actually asking. When everyone started asking to join I capped how many people I was going to add to a server to about ten. Im fairly new to Minecraft, so I didn't know how to add anyone to my server at first (process is actually more complicated than I thought), or whether there was a limit to how many people I could add (is there a limit?). A friend and I are currently in the process of getting the Minecraft UT server started, and we'll add as many people as possible. 

I've only been able to complete the outside of Parlin Hall, half of the outside of Calhoun Hall, the courtyard in front of the tower, and a little bit of Littlefield Fountain (not pictured cause it's looking rough so far, she's a work in progress.) It's taken me about four months, this is more of a side project that I like to work on when I have time on my hands. The trees have been a deterrent honestly it's so annoying to make them.

The repica is not perfect, I don't think it's to scale and I'd like to work on that. If anyone has any tips on how to make this whole process easier, any apps I could download that would help the building/add more items I can use to make it look more realistic, or if they wanna go ahead and add some floor plans for the buildings so I can get started on the inside of Parlin Hall/Calhoun Hall that would be awesome!
