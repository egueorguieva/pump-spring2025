I'm an undergrad student here at BYU and I feel very lost and confused. After spending the last good while (2+ years) studying and learning about LDS theology, I no longer believe it. I just don't. I'm not here to argue about that or talk about specifics. It is a decision backed by more careful thought and study than anything else I have done up to this point in my life. I even ended up returning home early from my mission because of it (mostly painted over as a 'mental health' exit), but I still ended up back here for the finances/convenience. I am thinking now that it may have been a mistake. I feel so alone, like nobody does or could understand me. I don't know what my next step should be. I've been thinking about transferring literally anywhere but I'm so far along in terms of credits here that I think it may set my life back a good bit, not to mention essentially uprooting all of my social circles and likely completely changing my family relationships. I just don't even know if its worth it, do I just shut up and drag myself through the next couple years? Is it even an option to stay? I do really like BYU I just can't anymore with the church, I have like zero desire to attend Sunday meetings or even pretend like I care about the LDS lifestyle you know?

The women on campus are out of control. Just today I was ambushed by 4 different females while studying my scriptures in the WILK. It's like they can smell my righteousness the moment I step into a room. It's not my fault God called me to be an Assistant President. I'm of a different breed among mankind. Sue me. 

Last week, I was speaking to an old companion over the phone in my mission language. As I masterfully wove the most beautiful vocal tapestry in the Spanish language (that's right, I served overseas), I couldn't help but notice the drooling daughters of God that surrounded me. One of them tried to approach me, but I fended her off with the power of the spirit. After a few minutes, she finally realized that I didn't want to copulate against the glass walls of the Garden Court, and I was able to get back to my daily language study. 

In my classes, I know I'm different from everyone else. As they tell stories from their missions, I can't help but feel bad for them. They don't know what it was like to be an Assistant President. One of the guys in my Eternal Families class (easy for someone like me) tried to tell me that AP stands for ""Assistant to the President"", but I could tell he was just jealous of me. When the ladies have to pick between me and him, he knows who they will run to. 

It's just tiring to know that every time I step out of the house, I'm going to bombarded with marriage proposals and Facebook friend requests. Normal former missionaries just don't understand what it's like to live with a burden like this. Sometimes I resent my strong spirit and perfect knowledge of the scriptures. There's a reason my bishop asks me not to bear my testimony on fast Sunday. We both know that the average young woman wouldn't be able to keep her panties dry listening to me recite the First Vision from memory. The first time I did it, multiple ward members had to leave early because they couldn't handle my massive spirit. 

I'm sick and tired of girls only seeing me for the fact that I was an AP on my mission. Just because I led my mission to success doesn't mean that I want to lead you to 15 kids before we graduate.

If you're thinking about selling **Door-to-Door pest control** or someone is trying to recruit you, **DON'T** do it, this is from personal experience and will tell you the secrets no one else will.



First of all I've done this previously now and if you are like most rookies you will NOT make the money they tell you, you will make. Remember these guys are salesman and will really persuade you to give it a try and not listen to others who are viewing as a negative experience.




The way it works is you sell pest control contracts d2d (door to door) they are usually for 1-year and will average a contract value of for example $520. You as a salesman will get a % and usually they start rookies out at 25% (which is terrible by the way) so that's $130 in commissions per sale you will make. The recruiter will sell you this idea you can make $20,000, $40,000, $100,000 in one summer. **Reality is 99% will NOT.** It's a very hard industry you are knocking door to door 12 hours a day, 6 days a week.



Now that I get out of the way how it works, Let me show you the realty of it and not only MY experience but experience with other friends and coworkers and how we all get screwed and YOU will too.



So they will most likely give you a % of 25%, 30% or maybe even a little higher. What they DON'T tell you is if you don't sell and service over 100 accounts or sometimes even 150 accounts you will get a low flat percentage of 18%. This will cost you thousands of dollars. For example if you go out and work your butt off and you finish the summer with 95 accounts serviced. ($520x95accounts = $49,400(18%) you are only making $8,892 this is not including rent, groceries, gas, entertainment, etc. so you will make a LOT less than you would staying home with your parents working for $8-$15/hour. Since they prey on college students or returned missionaries from the LDS church.That is ONLY ONE WAY they will try and screw you over.



Another way is if you do happen to go against their favor and you do service over 100 or 150 accounts I've had friends I worked with who didn't even get their commission checks. So the way it works is during the summer you will get only $50 upfront for each serviced accounts and the rest of the commission you will get in the ""backend"" (rest of commission checks later in the year, 2 of them) which usually payout a few months later in November, and January. I've had friends who are out there busting all hot summer for 3-4 months to end up not getting anything. There recruiter will lie and say some of there accounts canceled and it fell below the 150 or 100 accounts serviced. To put in perspective let's say you sold and serviced 150 accounts and you get your $50 for each one ($50x150= $7,500 during the summer) with expectations you are going to get a $15,900 after the summer only to come to find out your recruiter kept all your money then will lie to you that some of your accounts weren't legit or they canceled. Keeping $15,900 of your earned money.

**I had a friend who sold and serviced 198 accounts..** and signed a 35% commission plan, which would of been like $36,000+ he would made (since I don't remember his average contract value) **he ended making only $9,900** ($50 upfront per sale x 198accounts = $9,900) and his recruiter would end up keeping $41,100+ (I figured this since if he only got paid it $9,900 that would be only 10% since he didn't get his backend checks. Since the recruiter can recruit someone and give them a commission deal the recruiter will make the difference of 50%, for example 50%-10%(whatever number they sign a recruit at) = 40% recruiter keeps) we will say he averaged a contract value of $520 x 198accounts = $102,960 revenue (40% recruiter keeps if they screw you over) Recruiter keeps $41,000 and this is how they make their money my screwing over multiple recruits and obviously wanting a couple of them to succeed because they will make override commissions of that recruit but also any recruits they bring on to the team the following summers, almost like a pyramid.


**DON'T sell door-to-door pest control**, 99% of the time they will screw you over. They are not in the industry to make it into a career, they are in it to recruit and have unexperienced and uneducated first year reps make their money year after year. Please spread the word and share this post with people who are thinking about doing it. This is how your recruiter is able to afford all the stuff they are showing off to you. (cars, trucks, clothes, gadgets, toys, lifestyle, travelling, etc.) You will be working 12 hour days, 6 days a week to make money for their pockets and since you're a 1099 ""employee"" that signed some pathetic agreement they can get away with this. You should really avoid any sales recruiter If you have any questions comment below or message me. I got screenshots of my previous agreement commission plan and screenshots how I got screwed over and I sold over the 150 amount.  


If you have any experiences similar or know of anyone who this happened to post below. Let's make it aware for others before going out and wasting their summer since some of us have tuition bills to pay, families to support, etc.

**To add:** Aptive and it’s recruiters/team leaders really do be trying to set you up for failure or set the odds against you however you want to look at it. Because they have control on what they put down on the agreement you sign for example.

- 18% if you don’t service over 150 accounts
- 18% if you switch to a technician (but in reality you won’t get any of it)
- they keep ALL your money if you leave home early (over 60% of reps do)
- if you don’t service a minimum of 6 accounts/week you will get written up then fired if it happens again, resulting in your recruiter keeping ALL your money (recruiters will say this is in both our best interest because we don’t want you to be out here if you’re not selling, but just imagine if you have to take a few days off for a wedding or you get sick.. lol)
- if you go home even a day early from the dates you told them on paper, written you are voiding your contract and they can keep all your money. Even if they say “talk to us and we’re understanding” don’t believe it, only what’s in writing actually is true. Had it happen to a buddy who went home only 2 days early from his end date and kept ALL his money..


Still think I’m only talking about my experience and a personal few other people I know, or maybe that I’m not a good sales rep? Lol If you got time read this:

My name is Tanner Bennett, I’m a 24 year old student and I’m running for Provo City Council! 

I’m extremely excited for this opportunity to participate in the democratic process, and wanted to tell you a bit about myself, my campaign, and why I’m running. 

Link to socials: [https://linktr.ee/bfp2023](https://linktr.ee/bfp2023)

# About me:

I’m a full-time student at BYU studying political science and Mandarin. I’ve spent my whole time at BYU studying about politics and the political process and felt compelled to try and participate when the opportunity presented itself. 

I am a global sales executive at a company in pleasant grove and have an extensive work history/background in building, working for, and running nonprofits. 

# Why I’m running: 

Provo is Utah’s 4th largest municipality with about 115,000 residents, 40% of which are age 18-25 with most attending BYU, UVU or one of the other colleges/technical schools located nearby. This 40% of Provo’s population has been repeatedly shafted by our City Council and major concerns of this population are completely ignored. Why is that? Frankly, **students don’t vote**. When I asked incumbents why they don’t campaign to or talk with college students it’s because we are not engaged. This is for several reasons that range from how busy we are in this stage of life, to complete apathy for government and I completely understand it.

**However, I want to change that but I need your help.**

I’m running as a moderate independent, trying to be a voice for Provo’s silent 40% on both sides of the aisle. This means that I care about:

1. Living within a budget (but also setting a budget that realistically can achieve what provo actually needs)
2. Acting as a voice for renters against abusive/manipulative landlords and providing concrete reporting methods and fines against landlords that refuse to resolve major issues for their tenants. 
3. Promoting active transportation and increasing Provo’s walk/bike/scooter friendliness.
4. Increase the level of shuttling and public transport offered for areas further from the universities
5. Continuing to fund, maintain, and improve Provo's trails, biking paths, and conservation/sustainability efforts! (Also improving our leash laws and improving their control/implementation-- nearly been bitten a bit too much!).
6. Improving the parking situation all over Provo while focusing on increasing our greenspaces.
7. Working to further improve the level of inclusivity for members of the LGBTQ+ community in Provo.
8. Focusing in on developing sustainable housing solutions for Provo’s growing unhoused population.
9. Attracting more businesses to Provo and helping our current businesses to continue to grow and develop.
10. With more to come!

People seem to hate that I'm running on a ""moderate independent"" platform, but at the same time hyperpartisanship is preventing us from achieving solutions that work, are cost-effective, and are based in science and research. According to Gallup research, 37% of Americans identify as moderate, more than conservatives (36%) and more than liberal (27%). I'm hoping to bring both sides closer to the middle and actually work to get things done.

# My campaign: 

I’m running a **$0 campaign** which means I am not seeking donations and I’m not spending any money beyond what was required to register. This means I’m not spending money on: 

* signage
* hand bills
* advertisements
* campaign managers
* etc.

What I *am* doing is trying to use social media to educate, promote, and share about the importance of civic engagement and trying to get the 40% people who for sure live in Provo 3/4ths of the year to register here and vote for someone who actually cares about them and their needs. I know what it’s like being a college-age student in Provo because I am one! In office, I hope that I can keep this platform up to share updates and news in a way similar to how Rep. Jeff Jackson has been doing, I think this kind of campaigning and communication is the future.

If you’ve read this long and this sounds like something you would support, I ask that you please take the time to like (or upvote), follow my social media accounts and help share my message! Together we can keep money out of politics and do a lot of good for Provo!  

Even if I’m not the person for you, I sincerely hope you’ll register and take the time to find someone who you do want to vote for! In municipal elections, your vote matters more than in any other.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this and hope that if you have questions you will reach out! Thanks again!

I know the past few weeks have been rough for BYU and BYU Athletics (and, just as a caveat, I 100% agree with our recent statement that we all need to be better and work together to create a safe, inclusive environment at BYU).

However, going to the BYU Baylor game last night reminded me of what makes BYU great—I believe that \*most\* BYU fans, at their core, are kind (if imperfect) people who want to make the world a better place. 

There were so many things to love about last night—the enthusiasm in the stadium was insane, and I sat by a bunch of Baylor fans who told me that we were the nicest fanbase they've ever interacted with (which is so good to hear!)

The best part of the night, though, was at the very end, when Jaren Hall walked over to Jake Oldroyd, who was bawling his eyes out, and gave him a huge hug.

For context, Oldroyd had missed two field goals (one at the end of regulation, one in the first overtime) that would have won us the game. I'm sure he was absolutely devastated as we headed into the second overtime. That kind of mistake can weigh heavily on a player. 

When we won the game, you could tell Oldroyd was absolutely relieved. Jaren Hall walked over to him and held him. What a stellar leader and teammate!

Although BYU fans aren't perfect and we definitely have lots of room for change and growth, I also believe that my time at BYU taught me how to be a better person, leader, and friend.

Taking more than 15 credits in your first semester is probably a BAD IDEA. 

Especially if you are taking notoriously difficult classes, i.e. econ 110, chem 105 

I graduated high school as valedictorian with a 4.0 gpa and 11 AP classes under my belt. My first semester, I took 16 credits. I didn't have a job. I got a 2.9 GPA that semester and lost my scholarship at the end of the year. Plus I changed my major two years later so I really wasted my time.

You have at least 3-4 years ahead of you. There's no rush! Take 12-14 credits and give yourself time to adjust. Replace a hard class with a lecture series or two. for many freshmen, this will be your first time living away from home, which is a huge adjustment by itself.

Also, IMO, AP classes do not really prepare you for a college class. Most high school teachers don't implement the same structure and format that you will see in a college class. My AP classes gave me false confidence in my college abilities.

Squeezing in 1-2 extra classes is NOT worth starting your college career with a low gpa. Especially if you have a scholarship with gpa requirements! Prioritize that scholarship. 

TL;DR: Be humbler than I was, take less than 15 credits, build a solid gpa, give yourself some time to adjust to BYU.",1,250,52.91,21.36,87.28,25.39,12.5,20,94,66.8,51.6,14.4,12,6.8,0,5.2,0,0,2.4,17.2,6,6.4,12,6.4,4,6.4,2.4,12.8,8.8,9.6,4.4,0.8,3.2,0.4,11.6,0.4,10.4,0.4,0.4,0,2.8,1.2,6,0,2.8,1.6,1.2,1.2,0.8,0.4,0,0,0,0,9.2,2.4,0.4,0,0,0,0.4,6.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,17.2,0,0.4,14.4,3.6,0,0.4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.4,0,2.4,0.8,0.4,0,0,0,0,6.8,6.4,0,0.8,4.8,0.4,0,0.8,5.6,2.8,3.2,1.6,0.8,0.8,0,0,0,17.6,8.4,4,0,1.2,1.6,2.4,0,,,

I feel like the general premise that BYU is to be different from other universities is a valid argument to make, but that argument loses its validity for me when we begin categorizing anything contrary to our own political views as the ""worldly ideology"" that BYU is allegedly adopting and, according to leaders, consequently destroying itself with.

Select leaders of the Church (oddly enough, the ones who have served as presidents of the university in the past) seem very concerned with the trajectory of BYU, and I can't really seem to understand why. Elder Holland's speech to the faculty of BYU last year seemed to trigger this culture of concern, and it seems to have stuck around pretty strongly since. I feel like BYU is simply just shifting the way we build our communities and treat and understand marginalized groups. Certainly there are students at BYU who are antagonistic toward the Church in general, but they seem to be a very vocal minority--I feel like the majority of students who are hurt by these kinds of teachings are not these, but are those who love the Church and the gospel but are navigating how to be more open-minded toward different viewpoints, perspectives, and backgrounds. Speeches like President Oaks' feel a bit divisive to me because it conveys this idea that we all have to think the same, act the same, look the same, and be essentially a monolith structured by Church leaders, and I simply don't agree with that notion. I also feel like that black-and-white approach is harmful and more faith-destructing than faith-promoting, because it teaches people that if they have doubts, questions, or concerns, that they should just leave BYU/the Church instead of wrestling with them and seeking to gain ""further light and knowledge."" In my opinion, some of the fence-sitters in the Church are genuinely good people just seeking to build a testimony on truth rather than tradition and they are having a hard time because leaders are rushing them in their process of receiving answers to their desperate questions and prayers. It's doing more harm than good, in my opinion.

I wasn't seeking to be offended by the devotional, and I don't feel that I was, just trying to grapple with why this topic felt ""priority"" and the point President Oaks was really trying to make. I don't see the ""destruction"" of BYU's uniqueness as a priority in my book when there are members of the Church literally killing themselves because they feel like they don't belong in their wards, communities, college campuses, etc. I just came away from this feeling like there is an imbalance in priorities among a few of the leaders.

I have some advice for you... MAJOR IN SOMETHING YOU CAN ACTUALLY MAKE A LIVING OFF OF!!!

A family member of mine was a straight-A student in high school who attended BYU on an academic scholarship. She figured her future husband would be the breadwinner, so she majored in something useless and irrelevant (humanities, I think?) 

After graduating, she married some guy and just had a kid with him. Right after she found of she was pregnant, her husband got laid off. He is still looking for a job, and in the meantime, the best she can do is work...retail. That's right, our former honor student with her fancy BYU degree is working alongside high school kids earning poverty wages. She graduated from college with no marketable skills, so thus far only retail will hire her.

I've seen this happen over and over and over again: academically-talented young women who put all their eggs in the homemaker basket and then get a rude awakening when they get divorced, widowed, their husband loses his job, or they never find a husband in the first place. I recently brought this up in in last week's Gospel Doctrine class (we were discussing the principle of self-reliance) and literally every person in the room had a similar story from their friend circle.

I think it's great that BYU and the Church extol the preeminence of motherhood and I'm *not* dissing SAHMs, but you must be prepared to take on the role of breadwinner should the need arise and earlier you can develop those skills or earn those credentials, the better off you'll be.",1,280,49.32,98.42,15.38,20.23,21.54,19.29,92.86,70,55.36,16.43,12.86,2.5,0.71,2.14,5,1.79,3.57,15.71,7.86,0.36,12.5,9.29,3.57,6.79,1.07,17.5,5.71,2.5,9.64,3.93,3.93,1.79,11.07,1.43,9.64,2.5,0.36,2.86,1.43,1.07,2.14,0,3.57,1.79,1.79,0.36,0,0.36,0,0.36,0,0,21.79,2.86,0.36,0,0.71,1.07,1.07,18.93,3.21,0.71,5.36,2.86,0,0,0,0,11.43,0,0.36,9.64,2.5,0.71,1.07,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.36,0.36,0,0.36,0,1.79,0.36,0,0,0.71,0.36,0.71,6.43,8.93,0.71,1.43,6.43,1.07,0,0,5.36,5.36,3.93,1.79,0,0,0,0,0,17.5,5.36,4.64,0.71,1.07,2.14,3.57,0,,,

This speech really didn’t sit well with me. The invitation to replace “the church” with “Jesus Christ” anytime we have concerns or questions is a thought-stopping and theologically flawed approach. We know from history the church has been wrong so what’s up with this teaching becoming so pervasive nowadays? 

Additionally, stating that people aren’t truly following Christ unless they’re doing it through the Church is just so weird when we simultaneously acknowledge the validity of other denominational Christians, and many of my current friends continue to believe in and follow Christ independent of the church because of bad experiences they’ve had. We need to honor that instead of judging it. 

Why are we getting messages like this from the church so often? It’s so exhausting and old.

So I was chatting with one of my professors last week and apparently the Office of Belonging from here on out will only be providing services for racial/ethnic minority students and disabled students. Additionally, they sent this invite out to faculty to pass along to their “LGBTQ+ students” (as if professors are supposed to just know who is queer and who isn’t, because if you’re not out you’re apparently not queer) for an activity in the Wilk and the invite originally didn’t have the location of the gathering; you had to contact Women’s Services to get the room number. My professor chose to add it on regardless. 

How is Women’s Services an appropriate organization to house LGBTQ+ efforts on campus? How are queer issues strictly women’s issues? This is just so bizarre and sad to me. LGBTQ+ are by far the most mistreated students on campus and to not allow them a space in an office designed to integrate belonging is just cruel. And to advertise LGBTQ+ events intentionally without a room number to gatekeep the event and (presumably) require potentially closeted students to reach out first to get the location makes me super weary. This is why I am not out at BYU and probably never will be. 

I had high hopes for this office, but it seems to be turning out to be just another disappointing, virtue signaling pick-and-choose fest. Anyone know anyone who works at the office of belonging or has more insight on what on earth is going on here? I’d love another perspective if I’m getting it wrong here, but from what I’ve been told I can’t help but feel like the university is yet again signaling that it doesn’t care about its queer population.

Edit: here is insider information provided below from someone who talked with an employee in the office: 

“Here’s what I’ve learned today from a member of the Office of Belonging…

-- Any student who wants to talk with someone at the Office of Belonging is absolutely welcome and encouraged to come in, including LGBTQ+ students. Students who have experienced any form of discrimination can make their reports through in the Office of Belonging.

-- The Office of Belonging wants LGBTQ students, along with students from other demographics, to participate on student councils, in focus groups, as student employees/researchers, and on panels. If any student is interested in becoming involved with these projects, they’re encouraged to reach out to the Office of Belonging.

-- The Office of Belonging will be involved in developing education and training for employees and students. The experience of LGBTQ students is an important consideration in the curriculum.

-- Rather than having just one place for LGBTQ students to find support, the Office of Belonging would love to consult with any department who is interested in creating more welcoming environments for LGBTQ students.

-- Independent Office of Belonging events will be for the entire campus community rather than specific groups (Belonging Begins with Me, etc). Any demographic-specific events will be cosponsored with other departments. Ex- The Office of Belonging will not independently organize an event for students with disabilities but would consider co-sponsoring an event organized by the University Accessibility Center.”",1,540,78.59,44.44,46.17,48.44,22.5,26.11,93.15,67.22,56.67,8.89,5.19,2.41,0,0.56,0,0.93,3.7,11.3,6.3,0.56,19.81,9.81,6.11,5.37,2.04,16.67,4.81,2.59,5.37,4.07,0.56,0.74,16.11,0.37,15.37,3.15,1.67,2.41,3.89,0.19,5.37,0,4.07,2.96,1.11,1.3,0.56,0.74,0,0.19,0.37,0,14.26,4.07,1.11,0.37,0.56,0.74,0.93,10,0,0,0.56,0,0.37,0,0.37,0,12.96,0,0.74,12.22,0,0,2.78,0,0,0,0,0,2.78,0,0,0.56,0.93,0.74,0.37,0,0.56,0,0,0.74,5,8.52,0.56,1.11,6.67,0.37,0,0.19,1.3,2.96,6.11,2.41,0.37,0.19,0.19,0,0,16.85,4.07,2.59,0.74,0,2.78,6.67,0,,,

While increased media attention and sustained critiques regarding conservative stances on social issues have caused a PR nightmare for BYU's administration, one less acknowledged point of secular judgment stems from BYU's rigid and seemingly arbitrary enforcement of the beard ban.

While the beard ban once served the purpose of discouraging anti-authoritarian protests in the 60s and 70s, nowadays the meaning of the beard ban has faded into obscurity. Instead of serving any apparent social cause, the beard ban seems to be enforced as a matter of tradition. Although beards have no negative connotation in contemporary society (indeed, they may have a positive connotation), BYU has continued to enforce the ban as a matter of principle.

While it is entirely within BYU's rights to enforce such a ban, I suspect that by doing so, they inadvertently cast a bad light on the University as well as its sponsoring organization the LDS church. To outsiders, the continued enforcement of a 1960's dress code seems to denote a spirit of rigidity and inflexibility that permeates BYU's administration. The inability of BYU's policy to update to better accommodate contemporary social norms and grooming trends reeks of arbitrarity and dogmatism.

As the outward-facing academic institution of the LDS Church, the beard ban raises questions regarding the Church's ability to cope with similar trends on a global scale. That is, can the Church adapt and grow to meet the needs of a new generation, or, like BYU, will it stay rooted in arbitrary traditions and dogmatisms that have arisen from a previous time? If the beard ban were rooted in LDS theology, then I suspect there would be good grounds for maintaining a beard ban on campus. But, given that the original justifications for the ban have faded into obsolescence, all that remains is a shadow of BYU's (and possibly the LDS Church's) resistance to change, commitment to another generation's social norms, and a failure to update to the current needs of the modern world.",1,370,97.06,40.06,24.54,17.12,30.83,24.86,79.46,57.03,46.22,4.32,1.08,0.54,0,0,0,0.54,3.24,16.22,11.62,1.35,15.95,5.41,2.43,6.76,0.27,8.65,6.76,2.7,6.76,2.97,1.35,2.7,10.27,0.54,9.73,2.7,1.35,1.08,3.24,0.81,2.16,0,2.97,1.35,1.62,1.08,0.27,0.81,0,0,0.27,0,6.49,1.89,0.27,0.54,0.27,0,0.27,2.97,0,0,0,0,0.27,0.27,0,0,4.32,0,0,2.16,0,2.16,2.7,0.27,0,0,0.27,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.27,0,4.05,7.03,0.54,0.54,4.32,1.62,0,0,5.14,1.62,3.78,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,12.97,2.97,5.14,0.27,0,2.97,1.62,0,,,

So the Church Newsroom just published this today, and sent an email out to all of us students notifying us of these changes. It's been posted in other parts of this sub, but I have to post here to add my own thoughts as an active member of the church and a current BYU student.

Dress & grooming standards doubled down on the beard ban, so no flexibility there. BYU-I students can wear shorts now (which I would hardly call progress) due to the alignment of dress and grooming standards across all CES institutions.

Honor Code doubled down on LGBTQ+ students and same-sex romantic behavior.

**Worst of all:** in order to be endorsed to attend BYU, students must do more than simply follow Honor Code standards; they are **now expected to answer questions mirroring all of the temple recommend interview questions to the satisfaction of their local leader in order to retain their academic standing at BYU.**

I have friends here who struggle with Joseph Smith, the Book of Mormon, aspects of church history, sustaining church leadership, paying tithing, being temple worthy, and a variety of other things. This change has absolutely told those students that they don't belong here. If you can't profess faith in these things, and prove to your bishop that you have a testimony of them, you're out.

The church is a so-called place for sinners, but I guess BYU is not. I am *furious* about this. I hope people understand just how much this will damage students and professors alike. What an absolute failure on behalf of the Church Educational Board for making these changes.

They just effectively gave the boot to more than half of my friends at BYU.",1,296,68.68,73.01,41.2,51.44,19.73,21.28,87.16,63.18,53.72,12.5,7.09,2.7,0.68,1.35,0,2.03,5.41,15.2,5.74,0.68,15.88,6.76,5.74,5.41,1.35,11.49,6.08,4.73,9.12,4.39,2.03,2.7,12.84,1.69,10.47,2.7,1.69,1.69,2.03,1.01,4.05,0,5.41,3.72,1.69,1.01,0.68,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,17.91,6.08,0.68,0,0.34,1.69,2.03,11.82,0,0.68,0,0,0.68,0,0,0.68,11.15,0,0,6.76,0.34,4.05,0.68,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,0,1.01,0.34,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,0,0,5.74,5.41,0,0,5.41,0,0,0,3.72,2.03,5.07,1.69,0.34,0,0.34,0,0,18.58,5.41,4.39,0,0,1.69,7.09,0,,,

I am a recent BYU alumni. I come from a family of die-hard BYU fans and mostly active members of the church. I, myself, am in the middle of a faith transition and as a result, am diving deeper than ever into the history, good and bad, of the church and BYU. I recently came across this information that shocked and appalled me. 

BYU approved and allowed a study in 1976 that essentially gave gay students an ultimatum: either be kicked out of school and face church and familial punishment for being gay, or participate in this “therapy”.

Not only did it traumatize most of the 14 men who went through it, but 2 of them ended up dying by suicide later and others seriously contemplated suicide.

Though this doesn’t make it okay at all, I understand that at the time, there were other “studies” and “gay aversion therapy” practices going on at other universities, yet why would BYU, a school lead, ultimately, by a prophet of God, be a part of such a disgusting thing? 

It makes me so angry that BYU, which should be a school associated with the spirit of love and kindness of Christ, not only allowed this to happen but continues to actively discriminate and tolerate hateful behavior towards LGBTQ students.

Note, as I was researching this, I learned that Dallin Oaks, who was the president of BYU at the time, was asked about this last year during a Q&A at another university but denied that this happened, which is clearly a lie. Why would an apostle blatantly lie?

I’m not looking for excuses about why this might have been accepted at the time or any “hate the sin” garbage. I just want other students to know that this happened because I never did and I want to know why it’s not acknowledged, and even lied about?

I'm really struggling with dating here at BYU. It just seems like dating has gotten more and more difficult. I'm not shy so I've asked out lots of women, gone on lots of dates as well as been turned down a bunch, but I feel like I've exhausted my usual methods of finding people to date.

I'm a 23M senior in a STEM major, so there are very few women in my classes. Those I have asked have said no. I've tried asking out women from my other classes and have rarely gotten anywhere with that. Ever since I got back from my mission I've gone out as much as possible to try to meet people, like I used to go to club night every week. I don't go as much because it seems like 90% of the women who go to on campus clubs are freshmen. That was fine when I was just back from the mission but now at 23 even thinking about asking out a girl who just graduated high school, even by accident, feels creepy and gross. I go to parties most weekends but they're too loud for conversations. I use Mutual but matches are few and far between and texts back from matches are even more rare.

I've talked to a bunch of people who have had better luck than me and haven't gotten very far. My friends in relationships are either with someone they grew up with or someone who made it obvious they were interested from the beginning. My single friends around my age are either going after freshmen or have given up.

So I'm kinda stuck. Do I just go to the library and walk up to someone cute and start talking? My parents suggested that but it feels like most people in the library are there to study or hanging out with their friends and wouldn't be very receptive to a random guy walking up and striking up a conversation. Is there really anywhere else to go to meet girls closer to my age? Or do I just have to wait until I graduate and move out of Provo?

This is really stressing me out because I'll never have as big of a dating pool as I do here. I have no clue whether I'll be able to get a job here and other YSA wards I've been in outside of Utah are sparse.

The task would be to find a quiet place and record yourself reading aloud about 200 words and answer some open-ended questions about yourself and about language. You can just use the microphone built into your phone or computer. The whole thing should take about 10 minutes.

I've been at BYU for the past 6 years earning my BS and MS. I was supposed to continue on and do a PhD, but instead I'm leaving academia to work full-time. Why? Because I lost my faith.

I won't go into details about why I'm leaving the church, but let me assure you it was a painful journey and one that I did not choose. I learned some things that fundamentally changed my understanding of the church, and after a year of praying and studying and hoping I realized I could never go back to feeling the way I once did about Joseph Smith or the current church leadership. I have no hard feelings towards the members I've known and loved throughout my life, but Mormonism just isn't for me anymore.

The hardest part of leaving the church has been deciding to leave BYU, as that has permanantly changed my career trajectory. I would absolutely stay here if I felt like I could. I'd be happy to quietly resign from the church and continue living the honor code, but as per the university's Student Standing Policy ([https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy](https://policy.byu.edu/view/student-standing-policy)) that would disqualify me from an ecclesiastical endorsement. I could fake being active to keep my ecclesiastical endorsement, but I'm not willing to submit myself to that bishop's roulette game any longer than I already have. I feel like I've been forced out of my community because of something outside of my control.

In the past few years I have contributed a lot to this university. I've helped hundreds of students as a TA. I've led research projects that have brought recognition and funding to my department. I've mentored almost every new research assistant that has entered my advisor's lab. I've taught classes and presented published research at conferences. And I would have continued to do the same things for the next three+ years if BYU let me. I believe this school would have been better off with me than without me.

I'm not particularly angry about the situation. I'm going to a great job, and now that I've made my decision I'm excited for the change. But I really feel that by forcing people like me out - people who unwillingly lose their faith - BYU is shooting itself in the foot. Sure, there is a risk that former members might actively detract from the spiritual beliefs of their classmates, but BYU already has other policies in place to prevent that. I hope they reconsider their policy and start treating former church members the same as other non-members. 

The stated goal of the Honor Code is to encourage campus community members to ""conduct their lives in accordance with the principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ and...to maintain the highest standards in their personal conduct regarding honor, integrity, morality, and consideration of others"". I believe I can do that outside of the church just as easily as I did it in the church. In fact, it is my honor and integrity that demands I leave the church, and it's my consideration to others that demands I not work to actively lead others out of it.

I'll miss being part of this community, and I think that this community will miss me.",1,572,36.88,1.17,98.77,64.31,20.43,21.85,92.83,72.9,59.44,18.88,13.29,11.89,0,0.17,0,1.05,5.59,15.73,6.12,1.05,15.03,10.84,3.85,6.99,1.57,19.06,5.77,3.15,6.64,3.67,1.92,1.4,17.66,0.52,17.13,3.85,2.45,2.45,2.1,0.52,5.94,0,4.72,3.67,0.87,1.4,1.05,0.35,0,0.17,0,0.17,9.79,3.32,0.87,0.35,0,1.05,0.17,5.94,0,0.17,0.17,0,0.17,0,0,0.17,9.27,0.17,0,5.42,0.35,3.5,0.87,0.35,0.17,0.17,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.52,0,0,0,0,0.35,0.7,0.52,6.82,7.87,0,1.57,5.07,0.17,0.17,1.22,4.72,6.99,4.2,2.62,0.35,0.17,0.17,0,0,14.51,5.42,2.97,0.17,0,4.02,1.92,0,,,

When I first went through orientation at BYU, I was interested in the way that the honor code was pitched to new students. The presenters said that the honor code first began as a grassroots effort, initiated by the student body, to promote a higher moral standard of conduct amongst the students living on campus. However, as I have progressed through my time at BYU, I am not sure if I have ever encountered any student who particularly likes the honor code. At least every student I've met seems to think that some aspects of the honor code need to be altered if not discarded altogether. 

While the honor code may have represented a grassroots student movement from the class of 1948 (when the honor code was endorsed), it no longer seems to represent the values or opinions of the student body. For that reason, it seems somewhat facetious to pitch the honor code to new students as a body of stipulations that is presently accepted by the student body.

I am curious to hear other opinions though. What are your thoughts on the honor code? Do you perceive that the majority of students like it or dislike it?

I'm not saying BYU is harder to get into than other schools. 

But I think graduating with a high GPA at BYU is as tough or tougher than any school in the country. 

I had friends that went to some good schools. - UC Berkley, Pepperdine, USC, UCLA, UC Santa Barbara, UC Irvine. 

With the exception of one friend who took his university studies very seriously, every other person I knew that went to these good schools partied their balls off. I'm talking the frat parties went down on Thursday nights. Of course Fri & Sat. Then the good ol' Sunday Funday of day drinking. - I didn't know anybody who knew anybody who partied or just drank alcohol at BYU. - The parties in Provo (with no alcohol) get shut down by the cops at midnight because the neighbors (who are married students) called and complained. 

That Testing Center is packed with people up until closing at 10 pm on Friday night. 

During my time at BYU, I swear about 40% of the students were married; some with children. 

So... Forget how hard the classes are... if your class is graded on a curve... Good luck. You're competing with students who don't party and might be married. I'm sorry but married people are more focused on doing well in school. They don't have to try to date or be social. 

I knew a guy who for whatever reason attended Brown University for his first semester of college, then transferred to BYU. He said the general ed classes he took at Brown weren't as hard as BYU's. 

I knew someone who was in the Business program at a school in southern California that everyone thinks is a top notch private school. But he really wanted to find a wife because he was 26, so he transferred to BYU and chose the shortest major - History. He said his History classes at BYU were way harder than his Business classes prior. 

I knew a girl who graduated from BYU, then got some Masters at Cal State Fullerton. She was going to be a teacher. She said BYU undergrad was harder. 

Thank you for reading my rant. 

I guess my main point is, it bothers me people don't know how hard BYU is that haven't attended. 

I have a 2.9 GPA from BYU, and was rejected from two schools for Grad School, so I'm bummed. I really had no business attending BYU. I got lucky getting in. I should have attended a state school. Then I'd have a higher GPA.

BYU can’t have double standards. They can’t force students to stay home and then penalize them for doing so. I am a vaccinated student and I social distance. Why do I have to be punished for following the rules?

I have proof of my Covid diagnosis too. The least BYU could do is excuse absences that are Covid related when a student provides proof. I feel like I’m losing my mind here- anyone else?

I'm a Jewish journalist and I came out for both the rehearsal and performance of ""Fiddler on the Roof"" from the MDT program. I had a great time — everyone I spoke to was so earnest and thoughtful and I learned a lot about the LDS Church (also through this subreddit! I have an MA in religion so I get in deep) but it was also very strange to be in Provo, which feels extremely foreign to me.

I wrote a feature on the show, and on the Mormon-Jewish relationship, hope you guys will give it a read and let me know what you think.

The code links to a blog post promoting a protest against the recent proof of vaccination requirements at public events. If you find one of these, don’t waste your time and don’t support them. Their reasons for protest are ridiculous for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, vaccination is still not a requirement. It is only indoor public events that require proof of vaccination *or a negative test result*.

Further, the blog also has a testimonial from a parent of a student athlete, in which the parent claims BYU is forbidding them from attending their child’s events. This parent trashes on BYU saying:

“I have invested much of my life to creating and nurturing this child and chose to help my child attend this school whom I actually (yes, stupidly) trusted and they treat me as if I am an enemy. They discriminate against me as if I am dirty or immoral. I am absolutely neither and I am standing up and pushing back for all students, all adults, and parents and fighting against discrimination and segregation.” 

To whoever this is and those who feel the same: You’ve probably never personally dealt with true discrimination or segregation, as other groups at BYU have, and continue to deal with. It is disgusting to me that these childish adults compare their selfish wishes to today’s true social issues. Grow up. 

Also, if this parent “stupidly trusted” BYU, why not just leave? I’m so tired of people like this playing the victim. Stop acting like you’re helpless to the situation when everything is in your power to solve it. Here are some ideas: leave BYU, get vaxxed, or just show a negative test result. 

This person also goes on to say that it is satanic to require vaccinations for such events since that is how satan would operate, and “good people would stand up to this!” Whether or not you are vaccinated, good people respect other people, and getting vaccinated or showing a negative test result are the literal bare minimum effort ways someone could show respect to the other attendees, the school, and the community in general. 

If you read the full article, you can see that the organizers are delusional. They claim that vaccination breaks the fourth amendment, is discrimination/ segregation, and is a type of bioweapon. 

Please don’t support people like this. If you choose not to get vaccinated, so be it. Clearly I am an advocate for vaccination but don’t hold it against you if you refrain. But don’t act like you don’t still have a choice under these new rules, and don’t compare yourself to truly marginalized groups. If your only social concern is vaccination, count your blessings and try to sympathize with those who are still unequal in society. 

The people who want to protest to “maintain their individual freedoms” (which they still have since nobody is forcing them to get vaccinated) are the same people fighting against (or at least not actively fighting for) women’s rights, racial injustice, LGBTQ+ rights, etc. The blatant hypocrisy is outrageous! 

I know my opinions may be unpopular in this sub, but this has to be said. I’m happy to respectfully discuss the topic further if you leave a comment. Thank you for reading my thoughts/ rant.

But I’m worried about the honor code since I don’t attend down here. My family lives an hour away so I enjoy spending weekends with them when I can. I occasionally attend church with them. 

I really want to be a good person and serve others. I want to minister to others and help bring about Zion. I figure the church is a great way to do that, but each time I attend I leave feeling sadder and more discouraged.

I still pay my tithing diligently so I’m not free-loading (as much) on my subsidized tuition. Does anyone have any advice or insight?

EDIT: just to clarify, I am living every other aspect of the honor code. I feel sad and discouraged because my participation in the church for the most part has been to placate my parents (they have sacrificed a lot for me and my inactivity would make them feel like they have failed or that I am rebelling against them). This brings me sadness at church because I feel that on some level I’ll probably never have that child-like faith again and that now I’m attending for the wrong reasons.",1,290,7.55,1,98.15,20.23,17.06,16.55,95.17,75.86,62.76,21.03,16.55,14.48,0,0,0,2.07,4.48,13.45,4.14,0,11.38,9.66,9.31,8.97,2.07,18.62,4.83,2.76,6.55,3.1,2.07,1.38,16.9,1.38,15.52,3.45,2.41,2.41,2.76,1.38,3.79,0,6.21,2.76,2.76,3.79,1.03,2.07,0.34,0,1.72,0,10.69,4.83,1.03,0,0,1.03,1.72,5.86,0.34,0,0,0,0.34,0,0.34,0,7.93,0.34,0,3.1,1.38,3.1,0.69,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.72,0.34,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,11.38,8.28,0,1.03,4.48,0.34,0,2.41,4.83,0.69,8.62,0.34,0,0,0,0,0,11.72,5.52,0.69,0.34,0,2.76,2.41,0,,,

Both Provo and Orem have city councils that you can email and they will reply pretty fast. As for BYU is there a council or something?

There are multiple things that have really started to drive me crazy about BYU that seem like decisions made by people that don't ever have to suffer through them. The biggest one for me though is the off campus housing stuff that BYU has created. It is a system that has been around for decades and clearly doesn't work very well. I think BYU should remove their requirements to live in BYU approved housing. It has created a mess of once landlords get the title of BYU approved they just keep raising rent and caring less and less about the property and because BYU requires their students to live here there is no competition for them to get better. When I am forced to live with in a small group of apartments my ability to chose goes down. It's like only having 2 fast food restaurants in town. It doesn't matter how much they both suck if it is the only option you have, in the end you have to pick one of the terrible choices. I think BYU has created that with the off campus housing and now we have Redstone who is coming along buying up all of the real-estate and making it even worse for BYU students. Is there anything I can do to raise this to BYU's attention. I keep seeing post after post about their land lords did this or that.

BYU has been sending me mixed messages regarding COVID and how we are supposed to deal with it.   My fiance and I have both tested positive for COVID-19 as of yesterday and are in NO condition to be attending classes for at least the next week, possibly two. Both of us have classes that require in-person participation and do not offer Zoom options for students who are sick or have COVID-19. We have contacted the professors of our respective classes and the response has overwhelmingly been to just collect notes from our classmates and take the hit on our participation grades. For 2 of my classes and 3 of hers though, we know we won't be able to make up the material without attending and found out that we are likely to be dropped a half-letter grade in missed participation without the impact of whatever missed material we have to catch up on.

So this is my question: if BYU is concerned so much about the pandemic, why do they not require all professors to have a zoom option for their courses? We have been in a pandemic for the better part of 2 years now and it's astonishing to me that we can be mandated to stay at home and yet be punished for complying with BYU and the CDC's guidelines. What is even more frustrating though is the classrooms we typically attend all have been set up with tens of millions of dollars worth of microphones and cameras that were paid for with our tuition and tithing money to resolve this very issue, yet remain unutilized by professors who are ""over the pandemic"".  We are all tired of the pandemic, I understand that, but BYU is not a school that you can miss a week or two of and keep up good grades. I know grades aren't everything, but for students who are working to get into graduate school or beyond, they do matter quite a bit.

For other BYU students, have you had experiences similar to this one? Should we just attend classes, double-masked, and sit in a corner somewhere? Should this issue be brought up to someone? We can not be the only ones currently experiencing this issue, and what happens when students decide to attend sick anyways?

Thanks for reading if you made it.

Have you ever been asked these questions in Provo? Hey, I know we haven't talked at all, or you may not even know me, but I just met this AMAZING couple who is super-rich. They're teaching me about how to become like them. I'm not sure if you're up to the task, but next time I see them I can drop your name. Maybe they will want to meet you? Do you want to speed up your financial track?

&#x200B;

Ok, this has happened to me 4 times now. It's really starting to bug me/freak me out. Different people, one in Ohio and 3 in Provo. They ask you a ton of questions about your life and pretty much that's it. Then they will start to slide in references about how they have these mentors. This awesome couple just doesn't have to worry about money anymore. They spend their time as philanthropists. Helping people like you and them to do the same. Sounds great right? Here's where it gets weird. They usually ask to set up a follow-up visit (similar to on the mission). During the next visit, they just ask you more questions about your goals. 

&#x200B;

Eventually, you're starting to wonder what this is all about. Why is this person who barely knows you taking such a big interest in you?

What do your mentors do for a living?

Have you ever heard of information-based assets? That's what they teach me about.

Cool, I'd like to meet them.

Ok, but they are VERY busy and only take a few people on at a time. I can ask them if they would want to teach you.

What are they teaching?

It's not really mine to say.

What, did you sign a non-disclosure?

No, I just really respect my mentor. It's theirs to share.

Usually, if you press hard enough they will say that it takes 6 weeks before the mentor would be willing to share what they are teaching. They need to learn to ""trust"" you first. They want to get to know you.

&#x200B;

All of it's super creepy to me. They all seem to be the same kind of people. Summer sales bros who don't have any money (work at a dead-end job like at a gym). I also study sales techniques and they are using almost all of them to try to get me to meet their mentors. However, many questions still remain. What are their mentors teaching them, why are they so motivated to introduce me to them, how come if you're meeting with these super-rich mentors are you still a poor college student. Speaking of which all of them decided that college wasn't for them.

&#x200B;

Ok, this is getting really long-winded, but now that's it happened 4 times it's not an isolated event. They all say very similar things. Basically, have any of you had similar experiences? Have any of you gone farther down the rabbit hole than me? I'm not from Utah, maybe these groups are common knowledge. Either way, \^\^ if you're curious because I need answers. Every time they talk to me I feel dark and it makes my hands shake.

I’m sure you’ve heard a little bit about the residential treatment center industry, or the “Troubled Teen Industry.” Paris Hilton held a protest at Provo Canyon school in 2020. Bhad Bhabie went after Dr Phil for sending her to an abusive center located in Utah. 

I’m a BYU Psychology graduate and active Latter-Day Saint. Internship offices and advisors often recommended and even recruited for local residential treatment centers. After working at two between 2019 and 2021, I concluded that the industry (especially the centers in Utah) is rife with abuse. It’s an easy job to get, and looks “great” on a resume, but it’s not worth the malpractice and neglect that goes on. I’m astounded that BYU schools still help recruit for these places. The best professors I know told us to stay far away. Well-meaning but untrained BYU students have no business getting involved in inpatient psychiatric treatment.

I won’t put all the details about the industry here, but head over to r/troubledteens if you want more info. Look specifically for facilities like Center for Change, New Haven, Maple Lake Academy, Heritage, And Telos. Those are frequently posted as hiring on BYU job boards.

EDIT: Let me just add here: the anti-troubled teen industry movement has some very strong anti-mormon feelings. I can understand why. Most owners of these facilities are LDS, and most employees are well-meaning but uninformed and undertrained returned missionaries. Part of me hopes that by posting here, some healing can happen for those particularly angry at BYU or the church for continually feeding these places with employees that (intentionally or not) harmed them.",1,288,67.92,26.85,59.49,24.67,16,25,84.38,61.11,47.57,9.38,5.21,3.13,0.35,1.04,0.35,0.35,4.17,13.19,6.6,1.39,13.19,5.9,5.9,7.29,1.74,14.24,5.21,3.82,4.17,1.04,1.04,2.08,10.76,0.69,10.07,1.74,1.04,1.39,2.43,0,4.17,0,4.51,2.43,2.08,1.04,0.35,0.69,0.35,0.35,0,0,9.38,3.82,0.69,0.69,0.35,0,1.04,5.21,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,11.81,0,1.04,9.38,0.69,1.04,1.39,0.69,0,0.35,0.35,0,0,0.35,0,0,0.69,1.04,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,5.9,11.11,0.69,1.74,7.99,0.69,0.35,0.35,2.43,3.13,5.9,0.69,0.35,0.35,0,0,0,19.1,6.25,4.17,0,0,3.13,5.56,0,,,

“Update: Vaccination Status Report
BYU is grateful for the COVID-19 vaccination status reports received in the last week, but there are many students who have still not responded. This vaccination status report is required of all students who have enrolled this fall. Without an increase in the number of reported vaccinations from the campus community, BYU will need to take precautionary measures, such as requiring masks. Other measures may also be necessary.”

I haven’t cared at all if people get vaccinated. Maybe I don’t know the science well enough but it seems to me that the only people that are affected by someone not getting vaccinated are the anti-vaxxers. Someone else not getting vaccinated doesn’t have a huge influence on my ability as a vaccinated person to get sick. And the amount of people that can’t get vaccinated because of allergies is incredibly low. So I’ve never really been mad about people not get vaccinated, I’ve just kind of thought they were dumb. But I can’t blame/judge/get angry at people for lacking intelligence.

However - if we have to wear masks because of it, I will be mad. I’ve never heard of a respectable person not getting the vaccine.  Everyone that doesn’t get it just seems like they are blinded by something. I thought once the literal prophet posted a photo of him getting it, people would start to do it. It is idiotic to think that everyone (including the prophet and quorum of the twelve) are being duped by the CDC. Or that because it went through a different testing process, it isn’t safe.

I just got my deposit refund back from last year and it was way lower than I expected it to be. I called in and they “accidentally” marked me as failing the final cleaning check; “the most expensive one” as said by the office manager. Luckily, my roommate had sent me a picture of the form after the check to show me I passed since I had already moved out by then. Now I can (hopefully) get my full refund back.

I will say that I don’t have any evidence that they marked me failing on purpose to keep more of the deposit, but it does seem pretty convenient for a housing complex run by a notoriously scummy contractor (redstone) to do that with a tenant that has moved out for good….

This is what I wish I knew way back when I was a smol 14-15 year old if I could do it all over again with the same knowledge I have now:

\-AP Credit is almost useless for a lot of classes. Don't take AP Lit (you've already taken AP Lang, so it won't help you), and don't bother with APUSH. The exams are nice for validation, but not nice for actually satisfying gen ed reqs.

\-When they tell you to ""experiment"" and take lots of different classes your freshman year, this doesn't apply if you want to go into engineering. Only take required classes.  (of course I wouldn't have known that I want to be an engineer if I hadn't taken different classes and figured out that engineering classes appealed to me most)

\-Deadlines and due dates actually matter. There is no mercy here.

\-You don't have to be smart in college, you just have to be diligent. Do your homework on a schedule and use a planner.

\-Don't take 8 classes in a semester, even if some of them are very few amounts of credits. There is a sweet spot at 3 credits where you get the most bang for your buck. Try to mostly take these types of classes. 1 or 2 credit classes are way too much effort, and 4 credit classes are usually specifically engineered to be a full-time job and drive you into deep depression.

\-Take spring and summer classes. They're easier and less work, and they're actually saving you money because you'll graduate faster. The only time you're better off taking a semester or term off is when you have an internship.

\-Make friends. This is just as important as doing well in class.

\-Make study groups early on. You may not end up meeting very often, but it's great to have a friend who you can text at the last minute when you aren't sure about something - and it feels great to do the same for someone else.

\-Go to career fairs, join clubs, and try to do all the networking stuff. It probably seems useless but it matters.

\-Don't listen to music while you study. No matter how much you try to rationalize it, it never helps you. Even if it's Bach or Mozart.

\-Don't ever let yourself compromise on sleep. You need to be well-rested for class- otherwise, you might as well not even go. You will learn that you cannot stay awake in class unless you've had your 7-8 hours.

\-Carve out time for fun on the weekends. You need to turn off the ""school"" part of your brain sometimes, and if you can't do it on a schedule, you'll end up doing it involuntarily at times when you can't afford to check out.

Background: I am related to one of the owners of a not-insignificant property management company (NOT Redstone, thank goodness) and I was talking to them about the change. Below is a summary of what I was told:

The major property management companies had a meeting and it came down to them asking Redstone what they were going to do. Redstone's response was: probably drop all units from BYU approval and increase rent prices. When the management company responsible for 30% of the rental market in the area makes a decision like that, guess what the rest of the companies who are in the same market decide to do?

Housing for freshmen is going to be ULTRA competitive for the off campus so a lot of freshmen are going to have to be in on campus. Additionally, (and some folks might choose to be offended by this) some of the ultra sheltered type that aren't used to their roommates being the opposite sex, drinking alcohol, and riding the bologna pony/slammin' the clam might have to do a little bit of growing up when they experience a light version of what the world outside of Utah looks like. And on top of that, goodbye are the days of getting out of your contract because you're getting married, going on a mission, or _________ reason that currently permits people to break their contract unless you are willing to take the companies to court and somehow have more money than they do.

There's going to be some other second and third order effects that people aren't seeing now, but it's certainly is going to bring a shake up to the Provo Orem housing market. Downvote me if you want, but I'm just telling you what was told to me.

While one could write a whole book about the perils and struggles of BYU dating cultures, I think one of the best things you can do to meet someone you might like is take an elective class. This idea also works if you are trying to get to know people. Choose something outside your major that you are interested in and not a core class for another major. 

 These courses could be classes like: 

*  Creative Writing 
*  Book Binding 
*  Floral Design 
*  Beginning Sewing Construction 
*  Introduction to Film 
*  An Unusual Language like Welsh 
*  Camping Skills 
*  Rock Climbing 
*  Fly Fishing 
*  Martial Arts 
*  Bowling 
*  Pretty Much Anything on the Student Wellness Catalog 
*  Stained Glass 
*  Intro to Sculpture for Non-Majors 
*  Folk Music Ensemble
*  And many more

 I have specifically avoided putting dance classes in here as they make trying to meet someone awkward. Likely because dancing is already seen as a way to meet people. 

 Anyway, by taking these classes, you'll meet people who share your interest but not your major. Because this isn't a class in your major, you'll find you are less stressed about the course and have time to get to know the people in the class. As it is a class you picked, you now have something to discuss with the people you are meeting. That gives you a step to build a connection and build a friendship. 

 It seems that people get caught in the grind of trying to date in their singles wards or just apartment complexes. Sure they are nearby, but the chance they are interested in the same things you are is lower. By choosing an elective, you increase your chances to meet people with whom you can connect. 

I will note, though, that you should make sure you have a legitimate interest in the class and that you're not just taking it to meet someone. That comes across pretty clearly and can be pretty creepy. Perhaps that's why the dance class dating stuff comes across as awkward.

 So that's my recommendation for students wondering how to meet people and make friends.

Everyone knows BYU housing has problems, but it’s time we have a real discussion about the root causes.

Here are a few excerpts from “The Provo Housing Racket” that summarize our findings pretty succinctly:

—

Too often, BYU students are over-charged, abused, and taken advantage of by their landlords. And, despite good intentions, BYU is one of the greatest culprits behind Provo’s broken student housing market.

BYU places significant hurdles in the way of would-be landlords, limiting the supply of available housing and costing students more. First, BYU contracted apartments are required to physically segregate male and female designated units. Since most apartments in the U.S. are gender-neutral by default, a large chunk of housing is written-off on that basis alone. Second, BYU contracted apartments must be located within a certain distance of campus, limiting the geography for BYU housing to a mere 2.7 square miles. That area includes established businesses and married housing, as well as streets and greenspace.

As a result, many BYU apartments are thirty, forty, even fifty years old. Building new is expensive, and the pool of non-BYU contracted housing within the zone is limited. Most newer developments are on the premium side of the market (The Village, College Place, etc.). If students had a wider range of affordable options to choose from, rent would fall and quality would rise.

It’s bad enough that BYU has built a system primed for exploitation—a system where the rules of supply and demand no longer apply, and landlords can count on a captive audience of vulnerable renters. What’s worse is the way that BYU has abandoned its responsibility to protect students. Last winter, BYU moved classes online and told students to go home. Students on-campus were released from their contracts in the dorms without penalties. Students off-campus, however, were left to fend for themselves. BYU did little to pressure complexes to release students from contracts, even though the university could have threatened to rescind BYU approval for non-compliant housing. 

If BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing with all of the drawbacks that entails—special rules, higher rents, lower quality—BYU needs to do more to protect students. This means:

No more 12-month contracts: require complexes to offer fall/winter contracts since most students leave Provo in April. 

No more monopolies: limit the reach of companies like Redstone Residential that exercise unfair control over the housing market.

Finally, pick sides: when crises like COVID-19 break out, BYU needs to side with students. The university has played neutral for far too long.

Or better yet, BYU should let students live where they want and let the problems work themselves out.",1,483,88.94,66.8,31.91,15.59,19.32,30.85,83.64,57.56,43.89,4.55,1.66,0,0.62,0,0,1.04,2.9,13.87,6.83,1.66,14.49,7.45,3.93,5.18,0.62,13.46,9.11,6.21,4.14,1.04,0.62,2.69,9.32,1.04,8.28,0.83,1.66,2.28,1.45,0.62,1.86,0,3.31,1.45,1.86,0.41,0.21,0.21,0,0,0,0,8.28,1.86,0.21,0,0.21,0.21,0.83,6.42,0.21,0,0.21,0.21,0.62,0.21,0,0.41,14.7,0.21,4.97,7.87,3.31,0,1.86,0.41,0.21,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.24,0.21,0.21,0,0.21,0,0.21,0.83,0.21,4.97,11.39,0,1.66,10.35,0.21,0,0,3.11,3.11,5.38,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,18.01,6,6.83,0,0,0.83,4.35,0,,,

Since transferring isn't really an option for me, I plan on being more open with my gender identity at BYU, and I've already came out to my bishop and a number of professors. Everyone has been pretty supportive so far, which I was not expecting.

Anyway, I wanted to get my ID card updated to reflect my new name and gender presentation. I was a bit hesitant, since I've heard quite a few cautionary tales of LGBT students and the Honor Code Office. I ended up emailing the ID center to verify that what I was doing was kosher.

It turns out that the ID center was totally cool with putting my preferred name on my card and dressing in feminine clothing for my picture. The person I emailed even asked what pronouns I wanted used for me so that when I went in I wouldn't get misgendered. So that turned out really well. Getting the ID card updated was pretty easy too, I simply walked in, took the picture, got my card, and left no questions asked.

In summary, while BYU can still be a tricky place for LGBT students to navigate, things are getting much better for us on campus. If you're a transgender student on campus, you should definitely still weigh the pros and cons of coming out of the closet.

So I let my facial hair grow and shave before tests. I hate doing this, because I want to let my beard grow out, so a couple weeks ago I met with the Associate Dean of Students Nathan Ward to discuss the issue of beards.

A quick summary of our meeting: that sucks, there's nothing I or you can do, have an ice cream on us.

In all honesty, my meeting with Dean Ward was very cordial and respectful. I went in knowing that people would have spoken with him before and intended on getting some ideas on official ways I can go about appealing it to people in power. And that's where I hit a brick wall. While I got the feeling throughout the meeting that Dean Ward was on my side and in total agreement, he explained to me in no uncertain terms that there's no way for me to directly contact those in charge of the Dress and Grooming Standards.

He also explained to me who's in charge of them: the First Presidency, Twelve, and a handful of other commissioners who meet to talk about the entire CES once a month. He told me that they were aware of the issues and that they were aware that student sentiment had changed. I asked if he could bring it up, he said that while they do talk about student sentiment about many rules that not even President Worthen can make recommendations on changes to the Honor Code: only the board can ask for recommendations. ie the prophet, his counselors, and 3 or 4 other people. The last time they asked for recommendations? 1991.

I asked him if he could see the policy changing while I'm at BYU (two-ish more years), he said he wouldn't be surprised, but that I shouldn't hold my breath.

After 45 minutes of discussion, I said ""it appears we've hit a brick wall."" Dean Ward chuckled sympathetically, and as a well-intentioned final act of placation, gave me two coupons for free ice cream from Cougar Eats, which I enjoyed with my wife.

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah, we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County, particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We’re concerned not only for your well-being, but also for those in the local community who are affected by the trends we’ve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes, work, church, and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren’t wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you’re feeling sick, stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus, may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result, follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks, more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine, closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely,

Kevin J Worthen, BYU President

View Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jw291e/the_problems_with_byu_contracted_housing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

In Part 1, we concluded that one of the biggest drivers behind BYU's broken student housing market is BYU itself. In Part 2, we will examine Redstone Residential and MHE Real Estate as a case study on the greater Provo student housing market. 

\_\_\_

Most students have no idea who their actual landlord is, and unmasking owners can be a lot like taking apart a Russian Nesting Doll—one shell company after another. Consider the Liberty franchise. According to Utah business records, the Liberty on Freedom complex is owned by Liberty on Freedom (LLC). In turn, Liberty on Freedom (LLC) is owned by Liberty Square West Investors (LLC) and Liberty Square West (LLC). Finally, Liberty Square West (LLC) is managed by **(name redacted to avoid doxxing)**, CEO of MHE Real Estate. A quick look through the MHE Real Estate [website](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/) reveals that MHE is a major player in the Provo housing market, despite the fact that the average renter has never even heard of them.

MHE at least partially owns: Campus Provo, Liberty Square, Liberty on Eighth, and Liberty on Freedom. These are among the largest BYU complexes by bed count. Liberty Square is actually the single largest BYU complex by bed count. 

While MHE owns the apartments, Redstone Residential (a real estate operating company) manages everything from leasing to maintenance and rent collections. In other words: Redstone is essentially a middleman between landlords and renters. Most operating companies take a percentage of revenues, driving up rent and disincentivizing any expensive maintenance or improvements. 

Residents we spoke to at Liberty on Freedom noted aged buildings, shared bedrooms, cramped kitchens, and a single shared bathroom. With utilities, rent comes out to about $400/month.

Before MHE and Redstone, Liberty Square had a vacancy rate of [30-40%](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/liberty-square/) during the summer months due to the nature of fall/winter and spring/summer length contracts. Now, Redstone-managed properties almost exclusively offer 12-month contracts, and vacancy has fallen to nearly zero. The burden has shifted from landlords to renters, and students are left scrambling to find replacement tenants for the summer months even though most BYU students leave Provo in April.

Redstone manages about half of all beds at the large BYU complexes and an even greater share of the overall market. Because BYU has kept the barrier to entry for new landlords so high, many students are forced to choose between one Redstone-managed property or another. And if it's not Redstone, it's likely Aspen Ridge. Small landlords are struggling to compete or even get BYU approval.

When COVID hit, the MHE-owned and Redstone-operated Liberty franchise was generally uncooperative with students trying to be released from their contracts or get rent reductions. Meanwhile, Redstone Residential received [between $2-5m](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/redstone-residential-inc-3cfaf714208b0bbd8de93d67b90a1a92) in forgivable PPP loans. 

When a few large firms monopolize a market, competition falls and consumers are made worse-off. Granting students access to the open market is the best way to promote competition and loosen the hold of companies like Redstone and MHE.

It's time for BYU to step-up and fix the broken housing market they helped create.",1,548,91.18,55.29,39.16,27.48,18.27,28.83,81.2,56.02,41.42,3.83,1.64,0,0.73,0,0,0.73,2.19,12.23,7.12,3.1,13.87,5.29,3.83,6.2,0.55,10.77,7.85,7.12,5.11,1.82,1.46,2.37,9.49,0.55,8.94,1.46,0.55,0.36,2.19,0.18,3.1,0,2.74,1.64,1.09,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7.48,1.82,0.55,0,0,0.18,0.36,5.47,0,0,0,0,1.09,0,0.18,0.91,14.96,0,4.2,8.03,6.02,0,0.55,0.36,0.18,0,0,0,0,0.18,0,0,0,1.09,0,0,0,0,0.18,0.36,3.47,8.94,0.36,1.64,6.75,0.55,0.18,0,4.01,2.74,5.29,0.18,0,0,0,0,0,21.72,5.47,4.74,0,0,0.91,10.58,0,,,

Pro-tip: This is not the first time groups of people with different standards have had conflict.  So what’s the best way to deal with conflict?  Generally, when there is deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement, it’s helpful to agree to disagree.  

By the way, “deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement” is exactly what this is.  This isn’t Handmaid’s-Tale-style patriarchy trying to oppress you, and it’s not a progressive conspiracy to make you gay.  It’s decent people who genuinely hold one set of values disagreeing with decent people who hold a different set of values.  For the most part.

I have many friends and acquaintances from across the political and social spectrum, and we agree to disagree a lot.  I don’t love the fact that abortions occur, but I have good friends who are one-issue pro-choice voters.  I don’t think Islam is the devil’s scourge, but I go to family reunions with plenty of people who do think that, and I love them dearly.  I think socialism is an atrocious idea, but I haven’t blocked any of my Bernie-loving friends on social media.  Why?  Because we agree to disagree.  We share our opinions, we exchange ideas, and when the day is over, we shake hands and go back to our corners.

By the way, letting the other side “go back to their corner” is an essential part of agreeing to disagree.  Even though I’m pro-life, I’ve never chased an abortion doctor back to his house and picketed his front door.  Because that’s his house.  Even though I’m anti-anti-Islam, I’ve never gone inside my cousin’s rural Baptist church and shouted that everyone needs to stop sending money to Israel and be more open-minded about Islam.  Because that’s their church.  Even though I’m pro-gun, I’ve never gone to a meeting of Moms Demand Action with a firearm slung on my shoulder.  Because that’s their meeting.  Agreeing to disagree means you listen quietly, you state your case, and then you respect the other side’s autonomy.

In summary --  Even if you think homosexuality is a bad idea, don’t go to a gay bar and preach at people.  Nobody forced you to go to the gay bar, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave the people in the gar bar alone.  The gar bar doesn’t exist for you.  And even if you think homosexuality is just fine, don’t go to BYU and protest.  Nobody forced you to go to BYU, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave BYU alone.  There are plenty of universities that don’t think there is anything at all wrong with homosexuality.  Like, ALL OF THEM except BYU.  

I’m NOT saying, “If you don’t like BYU's standards, go somewhere else.”  I’m saying, if you don’t like BYU’s stance on homosexuality, that’s fine!  Stay if you want to.  It’s fine that there are communities that you don’t like.  There are communities that I don’t like.  We don’t have to change everybody we disagree with.  Let BYU’s standards be BYU’s standards.

Respect the fact that different communities see things differently, and leave them alone to do things differently.",1,550,17.81,58.46,74.91,16.11,13.75,17.82,88.73,71.64,58.91,17.45,11.27,3.82,1.64,3.45,0.55,1.09,6.18,13.27,5.82,0.36,12.36,11.27,7.45,6.91,3.82,18.73,5.45,2.91,5.82,4,0.36,1.45,13.27,1.64,11.64,2.91,2,0.73,1.64,0.55,4.91,0,5.45,2.55,2.91,0.73,0.55,0.18,0,0,0,0,18,6.73,0.55,0.36,2.18,0.73,1.82,10.55,0.36,0.73,0.18,0.73,1.09,0.36,0.36,0.36,2.91,0,0.73,0.91,0,1.27,2.55,0.55,0,0,0,0,1.82,0,0,0.36,0.18,0,0.36,0.55,0,0,0,0.18,7.45,8.73,0.36,3.45,5.82,0.18,0.55,0,2.18,2.55,8.36,0.18,0.55,0,0.55,0,0,24.18,6.73,5.45,0.36,0.18,7.09,4.36,0,,,

I was rejected from BYU just about two years ago. I was a convert with a 36 and a 4.0 and I was left feeling shocked and very hurt.

College admissions is a really fickle process. I don't know why you were denied (and if my experience holds, you will never receive a reason...) but I do have a firm belief—bolstered in large part by my rejection experience—that God will aid us in making the best of these twists and bumps in our life plans. I'm sure I could be in a fantastic place in my life right now had I been accepted the first time, but I also know that my life would be drastically different without the attributes I refined as I weathered this ""trial,"" the amazing friends and faculty with whom I connected at my other university, and the people I met here at BYU only because I arrived when and how I did.

Unfollow BYU on Instagram for a few months if you have to, but keep doing all of the wonderful things you did in preparation to gain admittance and striving to be the best person you can be.

Despite following all of BYU's mask and social distancing standards both on- and off-campus, I developed some COVID-like symptoms over the weekend. Per the instructions at [health.byu.edu](https://health.byu.edu) and on the Health Together app, I started self-isolating right away and I called the BYU COVID-19 hotline (801-310-0438). Since it was the weekend, they weren't open, so I left a message and received a call back first thing this morning.

You have to have an appointment to be tested at BYU. When they called me, they gave me several timeframe options during the day. You can either walk up or drive through. Masks are required. I walked since I don't have a car. When I was there this morning, it already seemed pretty busy with a few other people who walked up and 10-15 cars in line waiting to be tested. The whole process took me 5-10 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I left.

There is a tent at the front of the Student Health Center where you give them your name to check in. They took my temperature, and after waiting for a few minutes, one of the doctors administered the test. Yes, it involves sticking a q-tip type thing far up your nose, but at least for me, it wasn't painful and just tickled. They told me I should expect to get a phone call with the test results on Wednesday.

I'd imagine things will only get busier as the semester continues, so it's probably best to be proactive about getting tested even if you start experiencing even the slightest symptoms.

It was an upper-level CS class, and I was swamped with school and work and made an incredibly dumb decision on one of my projects.

I understand that I may have some harsh consequences coming up, I am going to meet the professor over Zoom tomorrow. Sorry to post this here, I am just distraught and wanted to ask if any other students at BYU have gone through something like this? What were your experiences? Did you survive (I know it is a silly question, it just feels so earth-shattering right now)?

I have worked so hard  in my undergrad  and it is terrifying to think of what this may do...

EDIT

So, one of the most stressful times of my life is now over and I honestly feel like a better person for the experience. The professor was incredibly kind and understanding, and assured me that life will go on. I felt guilt and stress about copying code for that project for months, and allowed it to hurt me, and I encourage any others who may be in a tight situation to never copy code/cheat/take the shortcut. Reach out to your professor, they are surprisingly understanding, before you make a bad choice. If, like me, you have already made the choice, try to do the honest thing. You will feel better afterwards.

It’s just a personal rant that I just want to get off my chest. In no way do I like to point fingers at anybody specific. 

I had a friend recently that was posted on a social media page where they denounced him of not wearing a mask. He just had it off for a couple of minutes to get that dampness off of his face. He wasn’t speaking to anyone, nor did he have malicious intent. I know this because I was there with him. And yet, people on the media treated him as if he was some sort of criminal. I would’ve understood if the person who posted the photo would’ve approached us and gave him a friendly reminder. But we received no such warning. Now, I don’t want to say who is wrong here. My friend, who is not wearing a mask, is at fault, but did he deserve such treatment? I also cannot agree. 

I’m personally not religious. But, I was a little surprised by how some, perhaps only minority, choose to act in these desperate times. Some people put their views and politics first that they forget the vital part. I don’t think most of the students have malicious intent to spread the virus. I just don’t know if pointing fingers at each other and determining who is right or wrong is the correct thing. I was just a little upset to see that some students in a heavily religious school like BYU like to blame or watch other people being accused. I understand that it's frustrating to see others, not 100% complying with the rules, but I also don’t think Jesus Christ would have reacted the way some people are reacting. 

There are just some personal thoughts that I wish to share with the community. I'm completely okay with people sharing different views or even disagreeing.

The Off-Campus Housing Office is experiencing a heavy volume of inquiries concerning the contract release process. We are asking student’s to communicate with their landlord’s or the landlords’ agent(s) concerning release.  The OCHO recognizes that the contract is a legally binding agreement between the landlord and the student.  However, the OCHO strongly encourages landlords and their agents to consider the value of releasing students. 

BYU has encouraged students to consider leaving campus and return home to finish Winter semester through remote coursework. We recognize individual circumstances may not allow this. (See www.byu.edu/coronavirus for more information.) The intent of this announcement was to allow students the option, when feasible, to improve social distance in the community and their living environment, thus slowing the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. 

Please be advised that in the event the community experiences a high volume of infected and sick students, the landlords will be required to follow the direction of state and local health departments.  By agreement, landlords will be required to quarantine and isolate students.  Landlords will need to provide housing to those impacted, which may include providing quarantined housing to affected students who can no longer reside in their own apartments.  The OCHO asks that landlords carefully examine the risks associated with keeping all residents under contract.  The university will not provide solutions to housing dilemmas which may arise in your properties.  You will be responsible, by contract, for meeting the needs of those students under contract. 

The landlord contract states (#18): “Landlord agrees to maintain the facilities in accordance with all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws or ordinances and with the applicable Minimum Specifications for BYU Contracted Off-Campus Housing shown in Section 20 of the Handbook. Landlord agrees to comply with any reasonable requests of the BYU Off-Campus Housing Office relating to the safety or general welfare of tenants, and correct any failures to comply with such laws, ordinances, and specifications in a reasonable time.”

See Section 16/Management Requirements; Section 17/Respond Promptly to Problems; Section 20/The Minimum Specification in the Off-Campus Housing Handbook. (https://och.byu.edu/landlord-resources)

We ask that you carefully consider the importance of assisting the students during this extraordinary time.

I was in [CEEN 321](https://catalog.byu.edu/engineering/civil-and-environmental-engineering/structural-analysis). For a homework assignment, we had to do [influence line diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_line). My friend and I did ours together. In my haste, I wrote the wrong conditions in the problem set-up, but still solved the problems correctly.

After class, the professor called me into his office and said he suspected me of copying my friend's homework. I denied it, saying we had done the assignment together and I just mistranscribed some information from the book. ""Here's an idea,"" I said, ""why don't you give me a ILD problem now to prove that I'm not just copying?"" He smiled. ""That's exactly what I'm going to do.""

He reached under his desk and handed me a paper with a problem on it. I sat down and solved it in just a few minutes.

He examined it. ""Okay then, never mind. You're free to go.""

The HCO was never involved.

BYU is chapter 20! Hey everyone, this is the first time I've shared anything about my book on the internet, and I'm sharing with the BYU subreddit because you all were the friendliest students when I visited.

When I was 20 years old, I went on a year long road trip around the USA to try to document the ""college experience."" I spent one week each at 23 of the nation's most interesting campuses. At each school, I would find a random student who would agree to host me. I'd sleep on their couch, go with them to class, sit next to them while they studied, and go with them to parties. Each chapter tells the true story of one week in the life of that person.

The BYU chapter has been a favorite chapter for many early readers. A lot of the book focuses on the partying, drinking, and hooking up that happens at most college campuses. But BYU was a completely different experience, and it was my happiest week out of any school.

I personally think that the BYU chapter of this book is one of the best explanations of Mormon culture for outsider readers who don't know much about Mormonism. A lot of my friends who aren't religious have read this chapter and told me they wished they could move to Provo.

You can read the beginning of the chapter here. [https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt](https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt)

If anyone wants to read the full chapter, just PM me. I'd share the full thing here, but Amazon only allows me to put 10% of the book for free on my website.

I'm curious to hear feedback!

My experience writing President Worthen I previously posted [this summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/em3vln/my_experience_meeting_with_an_associate_dean_of/) of my experience of meeting with Dean Ward. After that meeting, I left frustrated because I was essentially hitting a brick wall. I considered writing President Worthen then but decided that it would be fruitless at best. After an incident at the Testing Center, I was rather in a huff and decided to write President Worthen himself. I wrote a respectfully worded email. I wrote, after an introduction:

>I believe that an update to the Dress & Grooming Standards is overdue, and I have the vast majority of BYU students and my own experience in professional settings to back me up. The part that the I and the vast majority of students think should change is the beard ban. The beard rule has been in place for almost 50 years now \[this was a typo, I meant to type ""60""\]. My parents weren't even alive then, and they have multiple grandchildren. Times have changed, and the beard rule has gone from being a symbol of the professionalism and conservatism of BYU to simply embarrassing the school and by association the Church that sponsors it.

I then offered to meet with him to discuss my concerns further and gave him my contact information. Then I waited.

I received this response today:

>I understand your interest in changing the bead rule, but it is not currently a priority issue for the University.   We are focusing our efforts on things such as giving students more opportunities to be involved in research, internships, study abroad and other experiential learning activities; increasing the number of students who can come to BYU, and providing more opportunities in limited enrollment programs.  I would prefer to use the energy we have to advance those and other educational priorities.   
>  
>I wish you well in your educational endeavors.

So there you have it. I honestly didn't even expect President Worthen to respond to my email, and I can respect his response. I still think the beard rule is stupid and only damaging to BYU's reputation, but with other problems the school has I can respect that it's not priority. Hopefully one of these days someone says  ""why do we still have that rule?"" in a meeting and it finally gets changed, but I'm not holding my breath and I don't think there's anything left that anyone can do. It's up to them to act, and it's just not something that they care about right now.

EDIT: some of you might be wondering why I care so much and why I've been willing to put my time and effort into getting the change. I think facial hair greatly improves my sense of masculinity and therefore my personal confidence. It makes me look older, more distinguished, and more mature.

I'm sorry for making a post about the honor code, but it's been on my mind a lot recently, and I'm curious to hear what everyone's current opinions are regarding the Honor Code Office. It was such a hot topic of debate before COVID and I feel like a lot of issues never were resolved.

Personally, I have mixed opinions about the HCO.

First off, I love BYU's honor code and think it's awesome that the university encourages its students to live at such a high standard. The honor code sets BYU apart from other universities and creates a tame environment for LDS students seeking to be educated and spiritually uplifted.

The problem with the HCO, however, occurs when a student slips up. Unlike the gospel, which teaches that no one is perfect and repentance is possible, the Honor Code Office expects its students to be perfect. The HCO is unforgiving, and one mistake can lead to huge negative consequences in that student's education.

**In this, the Honor Code Office basically incentivizes its students to procrastinate repentance.** Even though a student may have the desire to repent of their mistakes, they might wait to do so until graduation out of fear of being suspended or expelled from school. There are other options, such as taking a year off of school and transferring schools, but these are pretty huge decisions that can be avoided if the student chooses to just stay quiet.

Now, of course, before attending the university, all BYU students are required to sign the honor code. I honestly believe that the majority of these students attend with the intention of abiding by that code as well. The reality of the situation is, however, that NO ONE is perfect. No matter how good their intentions, people are bound to slip up because we are human. I'm not saying that the HCO should allow for students to completely disregard the Honor Code. I am arguing, however, that the HCO should follow the example of our Savior and be forgiving towards the students who seek repentance and change. If a student breaks the honor code and begins taking the steps necessary to repent, I think that he/she should be allowed to continue attending the university.

**The Honor Code Office is great, but it could stand to be more forgiving towards its imperfect students.**

Anyways, those are my thoughts on the subject, but I am curious to see what everyone else thinks of BYU's current Honor Code Office policies?",1,429,66.46,28.52,26.65,71.45,22.58,23.31,92.54,66.2,55.24,11.42,4.66,2.8,0.47,0,0.47,0.7,6.76,18.41,9.32,0.47,13.75,9.79,4.66,6.99,1.17,15.62,6.06,2.56,5.83,1.17,3.73,1.17,19.11,2.1,17.02,3.26,2.33,3.26,1.86,1.63,4.43,0,8.62,5.83,2.56,2.8,0.93,1.63,0.23,0.23,1.17,0,11.42,5.59,0.93,0.23,0.23,3.26,0.7,5.83,0,0,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,12.35,0,0,10.72,0,1.63,0.7,0.47,0.23,0.23,0,0,0,0,0,1.17,0.23,0.47,0.7,0,0,0,0.47,0.7,4.9,6.53,0.7,0.93,3.73,0.23,0.47,0.47,3.26,1.17,7.46,0.7,0,0,0,0,0,14.92,4.43,5.83,0.47,0,2.1,2.1,0,,,

Now, contrary to the title of this post, I am not saying that no one should study computer science. Rather, the title is hyperbolizing but emphasizing the fact that you should approach the prospect of studying computer science with some hesitation, especially at Harvard. Studying computer science is not that much of a straightforward choice anymore. However, despite the exaggerated title, I honestly suggest that no one studies *only* computer science, without pairing it with a joint or double concentration in an adjacent field (e.g statistics, mathematics, physics and applied math). This is simply my opinion, which I think is an unpopular one, but I am just giving my perspective.

Reasons for not studying computer science:

1. *Oversaturated Job Market*: The job market is oversaturated, as there have been an influx of computer science degrees over recent years. It used to be that studying computer science at many universities would guarantee a solid job and studying computer science at Harvard would almost guarantee some kind of well-paying, entry-level big tech job. This is not the case anymore, just getting a computer science degree at Harvard isn't enough anymore. On top of taking and studying CS classes, companies are expected students to do personal projects/research or past internships, regardless of what school you go to, for internships and entry-level positions. In addition to that, passing interviews requires a rigorous study and practice of Leetcode-type problems.

The point is that studying computer science is losing relevance in terms of getting a tech job because employers are recognizing more the fact that computer science is not the same as software engineering. In my opinion, employers aren't necessarily prioritizing computer science students that much anymore for SWE/tech jobs over other STEM students (math, physics, and engineering) students. What you learn in most of your CS courses, which tend to be more theoretical, don't matter that much for doing the job. You literally need a basic understanding of coding (i.e. syntax, loops, functions, conditionals) and then some foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms (which you can get from leetcode). Leetcode-style problems aren't even typically relevant when you get to the job, but having a notion of efficiency is important. Even algorithms classes like CS120 and CS124 don't help immensely with leetcode. CS124 can help make **starting** leetcode easier, but you won't be able to solve leetcode problems well just after taking that class. You still need to practice.

Even if computer science classes like CS124 were tremendously helpful, the point is that many students take these kinds of classes, not just computer science students. CS124 is a very popular course among math, physics, and applied majors as well. In fact, the students who usually perform the best in these classes are people with more mature mathematical backgrounds. Employers don't really care if you've taken a breath of computer science courses; they're just looking for basic competencies in programming and interview material. A math major who's has a background in algorithms is essentially equivalent to a CS major who's taken an algo course + a bunch of other CS courses when it comes to competing for tech jobs, especially if both have the adequate amount of outside-the-classroom experiences. Heck, sometimes studying STEM doesn't even matter. There's a decent number of humanities concentrators who end up working as software engineers after graduation.

2. *Intellectual Return and Pedagogy.* I would argue that studying computer science over other STEM fields doesn't provide much of an intellectual and even knowledge benefit. As I mentioned, a lot of the concepts you learn in computer science courses aren't directly relevant to jobs in the industry. The fact is, you are probably going to forget most of the stuff you learned in your computer science classes a few months after you graduate. Heck, it's likely you can barely remember material from courses a month after the semester ends. The most important concepts you learn from college is how to *problem-solve* and how to *learn*.

While I would say that studying computer science does improve problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning skills, other STEM fields seem to be more effective at doing this for pedagogical and natural reasons. Specifically at Harvard, and also at other universities, computer science courses are generally not as well taught as other types of STEM classes. This pedagogical gap happens because material tends to be glossed over in computer science classes, while math and statistics classes focus more on subtleties and foundational concepts. This also seems to be because the computer science department is very research-oriented while other departments, especially statistics, tend to focus more on teaching. Most computer science professors treat teaching as presenting basic concepts needed to understand their research while other professors pay more careful attention to how they introduce a concept to their students.

An important idea is that computer science is literally a **branch of mathematics.** Therefore, many computer science concepts rely on using math skills. If you have a solid math background, which you can develop by studying subjects like math, physics, and engineering, transitioning to computer science is not really that difficult. Someone who studied computer science for years may start out with more knowledge than you, but they might not necessarily be better at solving computer science problems. Domain-specific knowledge isn't critical for solving many problems in computer science, because the knowledge can be picked up relatively quickly if you're comfortable with mathematics. This does not mean that people who study computer science don't also have the skills to comfortably transition to math and engineering, but it is easier to go from math/engineering/physics to computer science than vice versa. Even if you're interested in going into academia for CS, I don't think you get that much advantage from studying it over students studying adjacent-fields.

TLDR: Don't only study computer science. At the minimum, pair it with something else.

I have been reading the Harvard Crimsons old coverage of Cambodia, where the crimson openly supports the Khmer Rouge.

However, after the Khmer Rouge takes power and begins Yero Zero in 75, the Crimson while still supporting them out a kind of ""socialist solidarity "", the news of atrocities begins to cause some trepidation.

There's a rat infestation in Canaday, cockroaches in Canaday and weld (actual bathroom tile sized ones), and overall, the dorms are just ugly.

They also told us if you're on the first floor don't keep your windows open as there are thieves that come into the yard solely for the purpose of stealing from first floor bedrooms?? Insane.

Some people here really seem to just do everything perfectly. They have perfect grades (some in pretty hard concentations), have ethereal extracurricular contributions while also having a great social life. Looking at Rhodes and Marshall scholars, for example, really makes me wonder how some people manage to accomplish so many things.

For me, personally, I think I've always worked hard throughout college, so I don't really regret anything in terms of my work ethic. I study a challenging concentration (e.g a combo CS, Math, Stat, Physics), have a solid GPA, and landed a solid internship this summer. I do realize there are times when I could have done things more optimally and taken advantage of more opportunities, but some people really make me wonder if there is so much more I can do.

There are some students here, particularly the people who win prestigious fellowships and awards (Hoops, Summa, Phi Beta Kappa, etc.) who really make doing college look ridiculously easy. Like, I seriously wonder if these people are ever challenged at all during their college life.

My question is how do these people achieve these things? I know they work hard and have excellent time-management skills, but it can't just be as simple as that. I'm trying to see what they do to see how I can improve, though I guess there's not much I can do in college since I'm going into my senior year.

I'm really close to dropping out. Why does this feel like an undergrad school? I'm a first year PhD and I've been really sad lately at how little there is to get involved in as a graduate student. Most of the resources and opportunities that make Harvard a special place are reserved for undergraduates.

Most of the best clubs and orgs are only for undergraduates. Crimson, the entirety of theatre, lampoon, etc..

The amazing residential life system is only for undergrads. The parties in finals clubs are only for undergrads. What are grad students even supposed to do outside of research? Join the badminton club?? 

In my undergrad I did a lot of writing and theatre as an outlet and now I'm basically banned from doing either in any of the most active organizations.

Going to a bar and drinking with friends is sooo boring.. I wanna actually do shit. The mountaineering club has been really nice and let me join. Idk it's just hard to make friends outside your lab group and no one really cares. There are no school wide events for graduate students. No culture of going to the Harvard-Yale game. 

Some people tell me that this is what graduate school is like everywhere. That most of the institutions are primarily focused on making the undergraduate life as best as it can be. Graduate school is like a job they say, you're supposed to just sit around in lab all day. I didn't know this.. I thought I go to a research institution. To a school where they'd care about making sure we had lives outside of research and had outlets to keep our mental health straight.

Honestly I'm really disillusioned by Harvard and I'm close to dropping out. I'm in CS and turned down a job that pays six figures to join Harvard. I feel horrible.

While I don’t plan on going to grad school immediately after grad, I do plan on going at some point (i.e 1-3 years after grad). 

I guess my advice to incoming freshman: Get involved with research as soon as you get to campus, especially if you have any thought of going to grad school in the future. Research is also a way to show initiative and independence to employers. 

Now, since I’ve messed up and only have one year, I’m trying to make the best out of my current situation. I’m writing a thesis and am truly trying to do my best on that.

""Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

Over the last 12 days, the encampment in Harvard Yard has disrupted our educational activities and operations. The right to free speech, including protest and dissent, is vital to the work of the research university. But it is not unlimited. It must be exercised in a time, place, and manner that respects the right of our community members to do their work, pursue their education, and enjoy the opportunities that a residential campus has to offer. The encampment favors the voices of a few over the rights of many who have experienced disruption in how they learn and work at a critical time of the semester. I call on those participating in the encampment to end the occupation of Harvard Yard.

The disruptions from this encampment at the heart of the University have been numerous. Harvard College exams and other important activities and events have had to move elsewhere. Safety concerns over the past two weeks, including those raised as a result of students sleeping outdoors overnight, have required us to sharply limit access to Harvard Yard. Although some community members have said they are undisturbed by these conditions, we continue to hear reports of students whose ability to sleep, study, and move freely about the campus has been disrupted by the actions of the protesters. We are especially troubled by increasing reports that some within, and some supporting, the encampment have intimidated and harassed other members of our community. When Harvard staff have requested to see IDs in order to enforce our policies, supporters of the encampment have at times yelled at them, tried to encircle them, and otherwise interfered with their work. We have also received reports that passers-by have been confronted, surveilled, and followed. Such actions are indefensible and unacceptable.

As first-year students move out and as we begin our extensive preparations for Commencement, this ongoing violation of our policies becomes more consequential. Thousands of family members, friends, and loved ones will soon join us to celebrate the achievements of graduate and undergraduate students who have earned the right to walk in Commencement. This celebration is the culmination of years of hard work and accomplishment. The members of the Class of 2024 deserve to enjoy this milestone uninterrupted and unimpeded. It would be especially painful if students who graduated from high school or college during the pandemic were denied a full graduation ceremony for a second time.

The individuals participating in the activities of the encampment have been informed repeatedly that violations of University and School policies will be subject to disciplinary consequences and that further violations and continued escalation will result in increasingly severe sanctions. Last week, faculties across the University began delivering disciplinary notices to students who continued to participate in unauthorized, disruptive activity in the Yard despite these notices.

I write today with this simple message: The continuation of the encampment presents a significant risk to the educational environment of the University. Those who participate in or perpetuate its continuation will be referred for involuntary leave from their Schools. Among other implications, students placed on involuntary leave may not be able to sit for exams, may not continue to reside in Harvard housing, and must cease to be present on campus until reinstated.

Enforcement of these policies, which are essential to our educational mission, is an obligation we owe to our students and the Harvard community more broadly. It is not, as some have suggested, a rejection of discussion and debate about the urgent issues that concern the University, the nation, and the world. As an academic institution, we do not shy away from hard and important questions. There are many ways for our community to engage constructively in reasoned discussion of complex issues, but initiating these difficult and crucial conversations does not require, or justify, interfering with the educational environment and Harvard’s academic mission. Our disagreements are most effectively addressed through candid, constructive dialogue, building not on disruption, but on facts and reason.

Sincerely,
Alan M.

I’m a pretty social, outgoing person. I get along easily with people and I really wanted to have a large group of friends who I can just socialize with and hang out with. I did recruitment for several RSOs, and I was so excited thinking now I could have a bunch of people to spend time with, go out with, be friends with.

I was so happy thinking about having a “family” on campus. I have plenty of friends at Harvard, but I really wanted a solid friend group who I could hang out with all the time, go out to eat with, and get super close to. Not just sporadically see or study with.

I got rejected from every single RSO I did recruitment for. I don’t know why. I thought we had great conversations, I thought I vibed with the people. I thought I was going to have friends. This hurts so much worse because it’s not a rejection based on academics or skills. The criteria for joining an RSO is that you’re the type of person they want to be friends with.
It’s a rejection of me as a person. The members for multiple organizations each got together, multiple times, and sat down and agreed I’m not someone they’d ever want to spend time with or be around. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me that none of them at all would have me as a friend. Wondering what I did wrong. Was I not fun enough, not social enough, not friendly enough? I thought our conversations were great. 

I feel like now I’ve missed my chance. I’ll never have a “family” like that now. I could try again next year. But I won’t be a first-year anymore, and why would people who don’t like me now like me then. I don’t know what I should’ve done differently.

I’m so sad.

Context: The president of Mexico has a daily morning ""press conference"", which is broadcast on social networks (but in reality it is propaganda for him, his political party or his interests) and in one of them he exclaimed that people who study at Harvard learn to steal.

More context: Of course, the consensus of rational Mexicans is that these words are absolute nonsense, however, in this period, unfortunately, many irrational people are sharing this kind of speech by the president.

These speeches are a way of indoctrinating the exaltation of patriotism/nationalism, where the rhetoric is that foreigners are ""evil by nature"" and thay ""they prevent us from developing because they only want to take advantage of us"", in addition to demeaning the education, in a country like Mexico where half of its population only completes the first half of secondary education, this kind of speech in general mobilizes the masses who are looking for an imaginary enemy, generates feelings on ignorant people and unfortunately increases the popularity of the president.

They've been invreasing tuition during the pandemic even though the classes were remote, and now they're increasing them again? Why?

Edit 2: I have been asked what specific tuition increase I'm referring to, here it is. In May 2021 I paid $1880 for a 4 credit HSS class. This year, that same class costs $3,500 ($2,120 if you are accepted into an ALB program). This means, The HSS tuition has increased 86% for non-enrolled students and 12% for enrolled students. A CNBC [study](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/college-tuition-is-now-rising-at-a-rate-lower-than-inflation.html) from October 2021 notes on average tuition and fees in US universities increased by 1.3%, making the Harvard increase excessive. Another [note](https://finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation/) from [Finaid.org](https://Finaid.org) shows that tuition rates generally increase about 8% a year, which again makes the HSS increase excessive.

Edit: I have no idea why every single one of my responses are being downvoted. Listen, at HES, we're not the kids of hedge-fund managers, and some of us want to get a degree. But increasing tuition by 75% means we have to start over at another institution because it is no longer affordable.

The author, who was a writer for the Crimson, maturely entitled their piece: ""From a Suspended Senior: With a Raised Middle Finger and Love in My Heart"" claimed the following:

>I grew up trans in rural Maine, **working in kitchens and painting houses**. I’ve come face to face with the law, **moved away from home** at 16. Where I’m from, going to college is not a given and leaving the state is uncommon.

>But in the spring of 2020, **living out of a garage loft without running water**, I became one of the first openly trans valedictorians in the country and the first person from my high school to get into Harvard.

What they left out is the widespread news coverage that appears to make clear that this is a warped version of the truth.  For example:

>The very first decision he made was to move out of his family’s house **and into their garage**, where he could live more independently. Since then, he has worked a number of minimum-wage jobs to support himself, buying his own food, clothes and other necessities. **His parents didn’t ask him to move out** **or pay his own way**, but it was something that the teen needed to do for himself.  
. . . 

>The teen’s fierce independence is part of his personality, according to his dad, **Belfast Mayor** Eric Sanders.

I was in the Science Center on Wednesday, and I was having a pretty difficult day dealing with an upsetting situation. I was crying, a lot, sitting on one of the chairs/benches in the Science Center near the side exit toward the Kennedy School. I was on the phone with a friend, venting, and still crying. It was pretty clear that I was very upset and going through something difficult. 

Someone - a young guy who I assume was an undergrad - was walking by, saw me crying, came up to me and gave me a kind look trying to show empathy. He might have been wearing something blue, though it's hard to remember now. He might have mouthed something to try to console me without interfering with my call, or briefly asked me if I was OK. Then he stretched out his hand to me so that I could put my hand in his. I did. After that, I might have said to him that I'm OK, and maybe (hopefully) said thanks. 

To that guy: thank you for showing me compassion and empathy. Thank you for caring. Thank you for offering your hand to me. Your intuition was correct - I really needed human contact and support in that moment. I needed someone's hand. You were right to approach me and try to make sure that I was OK. What you did for me was not a small thing. It mattered a lot.

The distressing situation that had made me so upset will be resolved. I'll be fine. But thank you for helping me in that moment. More people at Harvard should be like you - but you more than make up for the ones who aren't.

TW: mentions of self-harm and suicide. Long post ahead, but I really need to get this out and get advice.

I'm a current sophomore here and to sum everything up, I am absolutely miserable at this school. When I first got into Harvard, I was so blinded by prestige that I just committed on a whim despite being fortunate enough to have many other good options to choose from. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day.

I'm not doing great academically; I came in pre-law but that has changed several times and I don't even know what I want to do anymore. I have other issues, but the worst part of it all is that I have literally no friends and feel like I don't belong anywhere here. Believe me, I have tried SO hard; up until this point, I would spend so many hours every week finding people to get meals with, joining tons of clubs, doing IM sports, quite literally everything people suggest doing to meet new people. But I never end up with any lasting friends no matter how hard I try to keep in touch, and many people have simply just flaked on me or abandoned me when we actually do make plans. I had really hoped it would get better sophomore year, but so far it's only been getting worse. I have nobody to talk to, nobody to hang out with, and every single day feels like the same thing on loop. Every night I just sit alone in my dorm either crying or feeling numb. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past, but with things being so bad this year especially, it's worse than ever and I frequently find myself seriously thinking about ending things because what difference would it even make?

I have had great friends in high school and other places; it just feels like Harvard is the one place I don't click with anyone no matter how much I put myself out there, and the overall fake and toxic culture here doesn't help. I came to college hoping and even expecting that I would make at least a few great friends and have a fun college experience, but it's only making me so, so depressed and alone. I just want to be able to go out with friends once in a while, have someone to eat meals in the dining hall with. Is that really too much to ask?

I'm really on the fence about just sticking it out for 2 more years or seriously considering transferring somewhere else. I feel like the logical decision from a career/future perspective would be to just stick it out because firstly, I don't think it will look great on my resume/job applications, especially transferring from a school as renowned as Harvard. Also, if I transfer as a junior, I anticipate that it will be very difficult to integrate with the new school and make friends at this point. I'm so miserable at Harvard, but I'm worried to let go in case my efforts to transfer won't end up being worth it.

Could I please get some advice? I'm so desperate and sad and I really need some honest thoughts from people.

In short, the members of the discord have completely migrated over to a new discord with the previous mods as the owners.

Why did the members decide to change discords? As another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p3c2y9/wrong_discord_on_subreddit_sidebar/) mentions, this was due to issues with the ownership. The specific issues were summarized in that thread, but the thread was locked before other members could elaborate on the details. The owner was never present, took credit for the work the two main admins did, and refused to transfer ownership even after a vote among the moderators on discord. This server was massive, highly active, and a crucial social hub especially during the pandemic, but almost nobody knew who the owner was. In fact, the owner had as little as 13 messages in the server over several years. This all got intense over the last couple of months as the owner ghosted all of the members, including the admins.

Now, this all just seems like isolated discord drama. This directly relates to the subreddit as the owner and one other admin are the major moderators of this subreddit. Even though the new [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/harvard) is the only active one of the two, the owner of the other discord server changed the link on the subreddit to redirect to their server rather than the active one.

All of these problems are a result of the moderation teams on both the previous discord and the current subreddit. The top moderators are not Harvard affiliated anymore and have been the main power holders for an extended period of time. We would not be opposed to the idea of alumni as moderators, but these particular moderators have shown no interest in being a part of the communities they are moderating and should pass off their roles to active members of the communities.

Perhaps instead of locking threads with questions and ghosting us more, you can take some time and answer them directly. Also, there is still a link to the discord on the subreddit. You should probably remove that if you are totally trying to disconnect from the discords.",1,378,93,67.92,24.32,17.18,21,23.28,84.39,69.31,59.26,6.61,2.65,0,0.53,0.79,0,1.06,3.97,23.02,14.29,1.85,16.4,7.67,5.56,6.61,1.32,10.32,7.14,6.08,6.61,2.91,0.53,3.17,14.29,2.38,11.9,2.65,1.59,1.59,1.59,0.53,3.97,0,1.32,0.53,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.32,1.59,0.26,0,0.53,0,0.79,8.73,0,0,0,0,2.65,0.26,0,2.38,0.79,0,0,0.53,0.26,0,0.79,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.26,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.44,3.97,0,0.53,3.44,0,0,0,5.29,4.23,3.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.11,4.5,4.23,0.26,0,0,2.12,0,,,

Harvard didn’t go how I expected. From the very start, I recall feeling unmotivated and struggling with even the easy stuff. I tried constantly, but never succeeded, in figuring out what is going on mental health wise. I really tried.

Without getting too specific, I regret how I spent my time at Harvard. I got into a particular club and thought it was a golden ticket to a particular path. It was a very Quixote-like because it was…not what I expected, and actually so, so much worse. It chewed me up and spit me out. I kept spending my time there thinking things would get better, but it was sunk cost fallacy thinking. I wish every day I put time into other activities.

I am consumed by regret and self-blame. I wake up in a panic over it. When I think of the “good times,” or the covid era when things were relatively calm and easy, before I joined the club, I feel legitimate fear. Does anyone have fear around nostalgia? I’ll remember something somewhat pleasant and feel absolute dread.  Like, why couldn’t I lock in at that moment? Why didn’t I do differently? Why didn’t I keep talking to that person I used to talk to? The gist of the thoughts is generally, “I was so safe then.” Maybe it’s because the rut I’m in has been causing some serious tension at home. It feels really scary.

My biggest remaining question mark, though, are the people. What are people actually… like? I’ve run into two competing explanations and I don’t think either is fully or always true: everyone is either an obsessive networker or it’s just full of amazing magical super smart people.

""Following a meeting of the governing boards earlier today, my colleagues and I are very pleased to let you know that Alan Garber, our interim president since January, will serve as president of the University through the end of the 2026-27 academic year. We plan to launch a full-scale search for his eventual successor in the late spring or summer of 2026.

After serving with distinction as Harvard’s provost for more than twelve years, Alan has done an outstanding job leading Harvard through extraordinary challenges since taking on his interim presidential duties seven months ago. We have asked him to hold the title of president, not just interim president, both to recognize his distinguished service to the University and to underscore our belief that this is a time not merely for steady stewardship but for active, engaged leadership.

Over the last seven months, and for years before that, Alan has led with a deep concern for all members of the Harvard community, a strong devotion to enduring university ideals, and a paramount commitment to academic excellence. At an especially demanding moment for higher education, Harvard is very fortunate to benefit from his intellectual acumen and breadth of interests, his integrity and fair-mindedness, his equanimity and empathy, his decades-long devotion to the University, his extensive knowledge of its people and parts, and his ardent belief in the power of higher education and research—and their potential to improve the lives of people and communities near and far. His time in Mass Hall has demonstrated his clear-eyed determination both to help the University chart a course through troubled waters and to affirm the primacy of the teaching, learning, and research at Harvard’s heart.

In conversations with many people across our community and beyond during the past weeks and months—including especially helpful recent consultations with each of the deans as well as an array of faculty and alumni leaders from the various schools—we have consistently heard praise for Alan’s qualities and how his leadership meets the current moment. People have highlighted his thoughtful and balanced judgment, his openness to different points of view, his even temperament in turbulent times, his concern for student well-being, his commitment to academic freedom and constructive dialogue, his recognition of diversity and inclusion as integral elements of academic excellence, his appetite for innovation, and his constant focus on the best interests of Harvard as a whole. Our recent consultations have strongly underscored the high regard in which Alan is held by a broad range of people who have watched him work and come to appreciate his strengths.

Alan is not only an admired academic leader but also a scholar and educator of exceptional reach. After graduating from Harvard College *summa cum laude,* he earned a PhD in Economics from Harvard and an MD with research honors from Stanford University. A member of the Stanford faculty for 25 years, he became a professor of medicine, economics, and health policy, and was founding director of Stanford’s Center for Health Policy and its Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, while also practicing as a physician in Palo Alto. Since returning to Harvard in 2011 to serve as provost, he has held faculty appointments in Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and the Economics Department in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As the longest-serving provost in Harvard’s history, responsible for overseeing academic activities throughout the institution and working to foster new connections across the schools, he gained singular insight into the full span of opportunities and challenges facing the University.

As noted, Alan will carry forward as president through the 2026-27 academic year and we will launch a full and wide-ranging search for his successor in the late spring or summer of 2026. We believe this plan will give Alan and his leadership team the opportunity to sustain and build momentum on a range of priorities and initiatives. It will also provide an ample interval for those of us on the Corporation to reflect, in consultation with others, on how best to approach the future presidential search, including how to ensure robust input from across Harvard and beyond.

As we all know, these remain challenging times. We have experienced significant divisions and pointed questions. We have hard work still ahead to reaffirm our core academic values and our collective focus on learning and scholarship. We must continue working to restore bonds of trust, to bridge divides, to combat forms of invidious hate and bias, and to foster a secure campus climate conducive to dialogue across differences. No less, we have more work ahead to amplify higher education’s contributions to the wider world and to shine light on why they matter.

Alan’s talents and experience position him well to guide us in this vital work. Along with my colleagues on the governing boards, I hope you will offer him your concerted support, and I thank all of you—faculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends—for all you do for Harvard.

Sincerely,

Honestly, I feel like Harvard should have followed what other universities are doing and start the semester with a week or two online. I know that sucks and is an unpopular opinion, but if Omicron is spreading fast and a good portion of students are going to test positive in the first few weeks, going online might make things easier for students and professors alike.

I’ve frankly just gotten really frustrated with how the professors here have been grading us in my classes and maybe I just had it easier at my high school or something and I’m bitching for nothing?

But I just think it’s wrong when one of my classes has a policy that only a certain percentage of the class can get an A, so a 96 was the cutoff for an A (which I BARELY made). I just don’t understand how most of my professors proclaim that they’re not trying to pit us against each other and grades don’t matter and then implement systems like this? I went into my math final with a 100% and left with a B+ because I did average (as in I did 4 questions perfectly and the other 2 had some mistakes in it) on the final so that corresponded to a two letter grade drop..?

I’ve just become really jaded especially given that my math professor barely taught us this entire year and so as a result I was teaching myself basically everything. I’m just like maybe this is the reality of college? I hate how everyone talks about grade inflation at Harvard because I’ve had the exact opposite experience, I’ve only had my grades deflated despite putting in my absolute best. I’ve become frustrated because I can’t even enjoy learning anymore because I’m stressing out so much about my grade.

I had my first research experience last semester and flopped on my research project. I basically got no work done and embarrassed myself in front of the professor that was advising me. This happened for two reasons: (1) I didn't manage time to work on the project properly and procrastinated on it, and (2) I wasn't that interested in the project to begin with. While I fully accept the responsibility for this failure and understand how I wasted the professor's time, I am a bit traumatized by this experience. The professor essentially told me and treated me like I was dumb and seemed apathetic from the start of the project when I asked for resources and feedback (it wasn't the professor's fault at all, but I'm saying what happened). I guess I'm a bit ashamed, as I left a bad impression on the professor, and I'm walking around a department where a professor thinks I'm incompetent and unintelligent.

I'm a good student and have excellent time management skills, in terms of managing heavy course loads at the very least. I also recognize that I failed because I was unaccustomed with the open-ended nature of research, and my lack of interest didn't help with that. I only did the research because I was looking for something to put on my resume rather than choosing something I genuinely wanted to explore and learn more about.

I think it is actually a good thing that this amounted to failure. First, I know that I need to be more organized next time to adequately allocate time to a long research project, and I know what things I can do to be make sure I'm spending the appropriate time and putting adequate effort. When I have to do my thesis, I now know that I can't procrastinate, and I need to properly structure my schedule to work on the project, so I can achieve the better results possible. Second, I now understand that it's important to choose research that you're interested in, so you're actually motivated to work on a project (this essentially applies to any work that I do) and don't just do things to put on your resume.

I know how to logically recover from this experience, but how do I mentally recover?

I'm coming from a fairly competitive public high school where I've befriended many intellectually curious people, but I've never experienced an environment where tons of people are top-notch in some way. 

I don't have any illusions of being a top student at Harvard. I view myself as being generally competent, well-rounded, and quicker in some subjects than others--and I'll work hard while I'm here--but I'm certainly no genius or creative savant. For those of you who were/are undergrad at Harvard, how did you navigate becoming an average student after being top of your class in high school? How did you overcome your impostor syndrome/jealousy to reap the intellectual and social benefits of being surrounded by so many unique and qualified people? Any general advice?

Thanks for taking the time!

I feel like I should use a throwaway for this (I'm pretty identifiable) but that's okay. 

I'm a first year student (college). I'm also international and have a disability - I'm blind - which doesn't help with all of this. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't find my place here. Last semester I joined some extracurricular activities, The Crimson and a Model UN  type org (although it's not Model UN), but other than adding something to my resume, I don't feel like I have any real friends from them . . I've tried talking to random people at Annenberg and I actually have people I could call my friends, but more than friends they are just people I hang out with and that's it. I feel like the relationships don't go any further. 

I also feel like I'm not taking advantage of everything Harvard has to offer- my flights were canceled so I got here late and when I did I caught Covid two days later, so I haven't been able to get involved in my extracurriculars this semester by attending meetings and such, and I feel like everyone else is doing so much more than me, or that I'm missing out on participating in clubs where I could actually meet nice, down-to-earth people (I'm not saying the ones I'm in the people aren't nice, but I feel like everything is so superficial and competitive...). 

I don't even know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe advice or just knowing that I'm not the only one this is happening to, but it's all pretty overwhelming and I can't help but wonder if I really did the right thing by coming here. Back home I have real friends and family who miss me a lot, and here I have... well, Harvard, opportunities and so on, but I'm not as happy as I'd like to be and I really feel like I should do something to change that. I'd really appreciate any advice or comments or.... literally anything.

————-

I’m new to Harvard

Hello! 

I’m taking the plunge and have accepted admittance to grad school this fall. Besides all the worry of financial stuff, I’m pretty excited for this awesome opportunity! 

Questions:
1. I’m from the southwest with mild winters, how are winters in MA? 

Well, my area in the southwest received a lot more snow than Cambridge! Haha I was actually excited to experience a huge snowfall out here but nothing! I went home for most of December and January so I’m not sure if I missed the coldest days, but I managed. Bought a thick jacket, gloves and headwear so the cold was manageable. I did, however, feel like I was getting more and more weary of the cold, wet, windy, and cloudy days as winter wore on. I think I may have gotten a little depressed, because at times I didn’t want to do anything other than stay at my apartment and sleep. Missed the sun and dry air! 

2. I’m thinking of driving, epic road trip! I want to have a car there so I can explore New England. Pros/cons? Like will I need to register with MA? 

So, I didn’t bring my car in July, but I did drive back in January! So, it was ok to not have a car, I got a term Charlie pass and they helped a lot going around mostly between Harvard and MIT. If I wanted to go further, like Walmart (can’t help it) I used the zip cars located outside my building or nearby. 

After a while, I felt very constricted to where I wanted to go — first by how long it took to get to places using the public transportation, secondly by how zip cars were not always available and it was getting expensive (and time restrictions on the cars). 

Bringing my car helped me feel like I had the freedom to go places. Parking — my building has a garage — so my car was nearby in a protected space (from weather too) but it was 2k for the semester. I got towed twice in Cambridge and got like 2 tickets. I got an ez-pass for tolls. I didn’t have to get MA plates either. 

Freedom! I went to New Hampshire (scary), providence, and lots of other places. I generally love to drive… back home we drive a lot. But winter months it’s pretty bleak around here haha

Traffic— first month was intimidating but after that, just being a courteous and respectful driver helps. Traffic isn’t all that bad, I’ve driven in LA, Japan and been in crazy traffic in Delhi!

3. School culture - what can I expect? I’m really laid back, and love to meet people— are people friendly? 

Best part of my school was my classmates and my professors. Everyone was so welcoming and supportive. So this ended being an awesome place for me. 

4. On campus or off campus housing? Was looking at the HU site for apartments, they are expensive. I also don’t want roommates or to stay in a dorm - I’m an older student who has had my share of that! 

I did not have a place to stay literally until about two weeks before I came out here. My window for the HUH lottery was the end of May and so nothing was available! There was an early window open in April, but I believe you had to sign a lease that started almost immediately and pay upfront. 

I’m lucky in certain ways, not the hitting the lotto lucky but luck with conditions— about two weeks before coming out, I checked the HUH website and there were two units available. One quickly disappeared and so I just selected the one that was left. 

It was a furnished studio and I’m so happy that it worked out for me. It’s quiet and next to the river. 

5. Elitism — how will I fit in as a middle/low income teacher? Are there Walmarts around? Lol

This was barely noticeable. My cohort were down to earth but some came from wealth. Didn’t matter at all. And I found my people at Walmart haha.

6. Best places to visit around Boston or to eat. My fam will probably come at some point would like to recommendations to get true east coast experience. 

Best experiences were the feast days at north end. Lots of places to eat around here as well. My family didn’t come out however. Haven’t had lobster roll yet :( or seafood for that matter. 

7. Down time— how much down time should I expect as a grad student? 

For my program August term was jam packed, but manageable. Fall term I took 19 credit hours. It was also manageable for me (it’s dependent on the courses you take) - had classes m-th so weekend was time to relax. 

Spring term I took just 12. And only had classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Lots of downtime! Again course dependent- I had a lot of projects I was working on though. 

8. Any other tips or advice! Thanks!

One thing weird is I got a grad meal plan thinking I would be able to use it starting August term— but it didn’t start till September. I had some food insecurity the first weeks of August. The receptions and such helped. My school finally is starting a food pantry for students - and I donated food because I went through that experience. 

I think my advice to my past self would be to not worry so much about fitting in, enjoy the short time at Harvard, make good connections and be yourself!",1,972,37.44,1.73,99,77.5,11.85,15.95,91.26,72.33,56.07,12.55,9.47,8.74,0.1,0.31,0,0.21,3.09,12.65,5.45,2.26,13.99,9.67,7.2,8.95,1.85,18.21,7.41,5.14,3.09,1.34,1.13,0.62,12.45,0.72,11.42,2.06,1.34,1.65,2.88,0.21,4.63,0,6.48,5.04,1.34,2.57,1.44,1.03,0.51,0,0.21,0,5.14,2.57,1.23,0.51,0,0.1,0.51,2.37,0.41,0.21,0.31,0,0.93,0,0,0.93,4.94,0.21,1.13,2.57,1.13,0,1.03,0.1,0,0,0.1,0,0,0.82,0,0.31,0.51,1.95,0.51,0,0.1,0.21,0.51,0.21,7.41,11.83,0.1,2.67,8.95,0.1,0.1,0.82,6.28,8.23,3.19,0.93,0.93,0.82,0.1,0.21,0,17.49,6.28,3.7,0.93,1.65,2.57,2.37,0,,,

How do y’all prevent sexual violence at large parties?  Hi Harvard — I’m a Johns Hopkins student and a member of several clubs relating to sexual violence prevention. Recently there was a drugging incident at our university that inspired a huge campus protest that attracted local news. Students have been trying to force the Hopkins administration to implement a university-wide program that will prevent sexual violence at primarily Greek-held events— perhaps by having sober monitors drug test drinks on students’ behalf, or by having drinks distributed by a third party. But we aren't certain on any details yet, so we're open to ideas.

There’s been quite a bit of pushback from the university and so I’m really interested in connecting with your university’s sexual violence prevention club/team, as well as determining what y’all do to monitor or prevent druggings and alcohol-adjacent sexual violence. Like, do y’all offer free drink tests or toxicology screenings? What kind of accountability structures are in place to prevent sexual violence happening at large parties?

Please feel free to DM me. I’d love to work with you and prevent sexual violence at Hopkins.

You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

I'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them. Remember, don't be downwind of John when you and your friends go to pee on him, and, most importantly, YUCK FALE!",1,668,29.14,98.89,37.18,79.84,14.21,19.46,89.97,74.85,57.63,17.66,13.47,0.75,0.6,8.23,0.15,3.59,4.19,14.37,6.59,1.35,13.32,12.87,5.39,5.99,1.8,24.7,6.44,3.59,4.79,2.1,1.5,1.35,14.52,1.05,13.32,3.29,1.95,1.8,2.69,0.45,4.34,0.3,5.09,4.49,0.6,1.5,1.2,0.3,0.15,0.15,0,0,20.81,5.69,0.6,0.15,0.3,0,3.74,14.97,0.45,0.75,0,0.15,0,0,0,0,3.14,0.3,0,2.69,0.3,0,1.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.45,0.15,0.6,0.6,0.9,0,0,0,0.15,0.15,0,9.13,9.13,1.95,1.95,5.09,1.2,0.15,0.3,2.84,2.4,8.83,4.64,0.15,0,0.15,0,0,27.54,6.44,6.89,0.3,0.3,6.29,7.34,0,,,

Read here. By now I'm sure you're all aware that classes after spring break will be held virtually. ""But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?"" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&adults=1&check_in=2020-04-22&check_out=2020-04-30&source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from.

With the onslaught of celebratory grad school, commencement, and internship posts on Facebook, I thought I would throw a glitch in the matrix and share my story: I was rejected from every summer internship that I applied to. It's the (supposedly) all-important junior summer, and I have nothing to do. But to be honest, I'm kind of okay with it. 

I think rejection stories are extremely important to share. I don't think we hear about them at Harvard as much as we should, but there's beauty in vulnerability. I started applying to summer internships several months ago. I even made it to the third round of interviews at my dream internship, and the company didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I was rejected. I had to ask them. After the onslaught of rejection letters sent to my inbox, I even began applying to random, mostly unpaid internships I found on Indeed, and I didn't get those either. I even applied to sell books at Barnes & Noble and I didn't get that too! And that was supposed to be Plan C.

But I want people to know that it's okay to get rejected. It totally happens. Rejection is not a reflection of your qualifications and self-worth. I do believe there's beauty in doing nothing, and I'm going to spend the summer entertaining myself and achieving my personal goals. I have every intention of sitting on my behind and watching 19+ seasons of Million Dollar Listing. I also want to get in shape and finally read the books on my bucket list that I haven't been able to because of schoolwork. Every time you get rejected from something, you can focus on something that you chose to do and what's truly meaningful to you. I like to think of it this way: I don't have to slave over a task delegated to me by a superior. This summer, I'm charting my own path.

My family is pretty upset about all the nothing I'm doing, and I'm not really sure how to address that. They have high expectations. But I have to say, I'm semi-happy with how my summer is going. Sure, it's cool that my peers are doing internships at Facebook, Google, and L'Oréal. But I also think it's really important to cast rejection in a positive light. You own the time that you've been given. You're free to define the hours as you see fit. I hate waking up at the crack of dawn, and now I can spend my time sleeping until the early afternoon. I hate commuting, and I've gained back three hours of time I would've spent commuting roundtrip. 

I don't really know how to conclude this post, but I just wanted to share that rejection happens to Harvard students and it's totally okay: cast that rejection in a positive light.",1,488,22.71,3.66,87.98,13.62,15.74,18.03,92.21,75.41,60.45,19.47,13.93,11.07,0.41,1.84,0,0.61,5.53,11.89,4.1,0.82,15.37,11.07,6.15,6.76,2.46,21.11,4.92,2.87,7.58,1.23,1.64,4.92,15.16,1.64,13.52,4.1,1.23,2.05,2.66,2.25,2.87,0,5.53,2.46,3.07,1.02,0.41,0.61,0,0.41,0.2,0,8.81,4.71,0.2,0.2,2.25,0.2,1.23,3.89,0,0,0,0,0.41,0,0,0.41,5.74,0.41,0,4.3,1.02,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.82,0.61,1.43,0.41,0,0,0.41,0,0,6.76,6.15,0.41,1.02,3.48,1.02,0.2,0.2,4.1,4.71,5.74,1.84,0.61,0,0.61,0,0,18.24,6.15,4.3,0,0.2,5.33,2.25,0,,,

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

Cambridge has plenty of parks and family spots...a campus shouldn't be that 'place' during a pandemic.

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

Some facts:

&#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

While students at other institutions may spend their time thinking about their grades, future careers, or their LinkedIn, Harvard students have a unique set of problems they face: **How to complete the three traditions as quickly as possible.**


No, going as a Yalie for your first Halloween in Cambridge isn't a tradition, but looking around you'll be led to believe it is. The three traditions I'm talking about, of course, are having sex in the stacks, peeing on John Harvard, and participating in the Primal Scream. While STEM concentrations may think they're too busy to do any of this, or that people couldn't *actually* be having sex in Widener, us social science concentrations are well aware of the social pressures put onto every student here to partake in these traditions prior to graduating.

If you're determined, any dedicated Harvard student can complete the trifecta of traditions in less than 10 minutes. Luckily, since typically [65% of the matriculating class are virgins,](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/harvards-class-2017-full-virgins-and-thats-okay/311342/) none of you should have any problem completing **step one: having sex in the stacks** in a matter of minutes. The hardest part of this is agreeing on which section to practice procreation in. While Greek Philosophy is a popular one, I typically choose the *Love Languages* section, just to set the mood a bit.

Once you've completed the first task and left Widener, you should have about 7 minutes left, which is more than enough time to get over to the John Harvard statue. This step is arguably the most important, as **step two: peeing on John Harvard** doesn't only serve to complete the tradition, but is an important measure to take in order to prevent UTIs. Depending on the equipment of your partner you may have to give them a lift, or help each other up, but synchronizing streams, while not necessary, is certainly preferred.

Conveniently, this act can be used to kill two birds with one stone, and **step three: the Primal Scream** is generally an involuntary reaction to the burning sensation you feel while peeing on John after having sex with a stranger in the stacks. Be sure to make it a good one, this is your moment. Everyone's eyes are on you, people are leaning out of Thayer to cheer you on, and they want to hear a walloping, unadulterated scream. Similar to step two, this is a good opportunity to team up with your partner and harmonize a bit. Give the Krokodiloes a run for their money.

After dismounting from the statue, you should have just under a minute left, which is just enough time for the two of you to decide which of you is running to the HEM, and which to Malkin, for you both to shower the shame off. Shake dry hands, congratulate each other, and begin sprinting your separate ways into the night.",1,482,83.07,66.85,59.91,52.26,26.78,20.75,89,68.46,58.51,9.54,6.02,0.41,0.21,3.73,0,1.66,3.53,18.88,8.71,3.94,17.84,9.75,4.15,5.81,1.24,15.15,4.98,6.85,3.94,2.49,0.62,0.83,14.52,0.83,13.49,2.49,1.45,1.66,3.11,0.83,4.77,0,3.11,2.49,0.41,1.45,1.04,0.21,0,0,0,0,11,3.53,1.24,0.83,0.41,0.21,0.21,7.05,0,0,0,0,0.41,0,0.21,0.21,2.9,0,0.21,2.49,0.21,0,3.32,0,0,0,0,0,1.24,0,0.21,0.62,0.21,0.41,0,1.24,0,0.21,0.41,0.21,5.19,11,0.21,3.11,5.81,0.62,1.04,0.41,4.56,1.04,5.6,1.66,0,0,0,0,0,19.5,3.73,7.68,0.21,0,1.87,6.02,0,,,

Do they not realize that all the students at the school are accomplished? In the parents class of 2020 page, there are lots of graduation things being posted lately. I saw a post of a HUGE banner that the parents hung over their garage with the picture of the graduate and their name and everything for the neighborhood to see.

I understand that maybe some of these parents don’t have another outlet to share the good news (especially due to COVID), but I find most of it to be very off putting. My mom mostly shares news with my grandparents or occasionally her friends, not other Harvard parents. Perhaps that is exactly the point of these Harvard parents groups and I am just not into that sort of stuff. I guess they are proud of their kids and want to share it with some like-minded parents?

In the first week, we cover Horseshoe Analysis, showing that even the most insane integrals can be shown to be true with a simple symbological statement. Horseshoe functions are integrable in real space. Currently, we are exploring applications of Horseshoe Induction in the Riemann Hypothesis over finite vector ring spaces. Our class, which began with 250 people, currently hosts 25 attendees, 10 of which who are currently viewing the material from the local psych ward. Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of proving the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) over finite fields in real space. The only prerequisite of this course is High School Calculus, with recommended courses in Latin and Greek Philosophy. All students are required to attend seminars ranging from 5 hours to 11 hours a day in which students discuss Richard and Mortimer and the metaphysical implications of the topics discussed.

It's the only Extension school that offers degrees. Extension school is misleading and for those of us who have degrees, people think we are in the same pool as those who have taken one online course some random time period ago.

Less than 1% of extension students even obtain a degree from HES. It devalues our diploma when the public thinks we took a few online courses.

Columbia changed theirs to Professional Studies and it worked out great for them. I understand that Harvard doesn't want to equate our degrees with other schools but we also deserve recognition for completing the degree given the difficulty in obtaining the degree and finishing an independent research thesis.

I haven't seen many reviews  online and thought it would be good for anyone considering the program to learn about my experiences before they get involved. Of course this is my opinion and others may disagree.

The Technology, Innovation and Education program is a one year master of education degree that overall specializes in the application of technology into education. You are required to take 5 classes that fulfill TIE credits and can use the remaining credits anywhere on campus or via cross registration at other schools. The TIE credit classes at the School of Education are meant to be applicable to many different careers whether they be designing educational programs, developing new education products, starting a business in education, bringing more technology into the classroom etc. You can find most of this information online and I wanted to share some of the pros and cons of the program here.

Pros:

1. Hands down the best part of the program is the cohort of other students you work with. Our cohort was about 70 people who represented lots of different backgrounds. Off the top of my head there were successful entrepreneurs, classroom teachers, programmers, business consultants, political activists, project managers, medical professionals and more. There were not a lot of people straight out of undergrad and the majority had some kind of education related experience. All of them were very inspiring, really personable and I felt really honored to be with them.
2. Being on the Harvard campus is incredible. You are open to just about everything going on at all the schools on campus and I felt it was really easy to meet people across many different programs through extracurriculars and other activities. MIT and Tufts are open to you as well if you feel like heading to another campus! Lots of competitions, classes, talks, meet ups, sporting events and that's not even considering the other things Boston offers.
3. The faculty are great. I really liked my adviser and the professors at HGSE. Across the other campus schools people are really responsive to meet as well. So long as you're a student on campus you have access to just about anyone.

Cons

1. One year is really, really short. If you are looking to enter the education industry but are not sure of the kind of role you are looking for your job search at the end might be difficult. Two semesters really isn't long enough to develop a solid set of new skills or to try out a lot of new things in the process. If you have a very clear vision (i.e. I want to start a company or I want to transition to a project manager in education) you will absolutely have the resources available to at least learn enough to secure an entry level role somewhere perhaps with the help of an adviser or professor. The classes alone aren't a feeder into any particular role and you will need to guide all of this yourself. In my opinion, the classes weren't particularly rigorous especially when compared with the core curriculum at some of the other graduate schools.
2. The career service office is completely overloaded and are not a lot of help. I don't know of anyone that took a job from the internal job board and the coaching sessions there are limited to 20 minutes at a time. The job fairs/employment seminars were honestly a little disappointing as some of the more well known education players either weren't present, weren't hiring at the event or clearly weren't serous about recruiting there (the scholastic people didn't even bring paper to write down interested candidates information!). Also the bigger companies that visited campus such as Microsoft made clear that they would not be accepting resumes and were only there to share their experiences in education. There are career resources present at HGSE through unofficial channels like advisers, colleagues, seminars and professors but don't expect the school itself to present many opportunities.
3. Alumni support is not as good as other graduate schools on campus. You can join the Harvard alumni network however there isn't really much in terms of alumni meet ups/reunions that the other graduate schools on campus have. 
4. As everyone already know the price tag is steep. Living in Boston is much more expensive than it used to be as well.

My Recommendations

I think this program is best suited for the following kinds of people:

1. You can get some kind of scholarship and get a leg up in classroom teaching opportunities. I personally don't think that the price of the program justifies the amount of ""leg up"" you get in teaching.
2. You are serious about starting a business in education and want to make use of all the entrepreneurship resources there.
3. Your company/school/organization will pay for this somehow or you will work in your original employer with some sort of bonus at the end of the program. 9 months is possible for some employers to work with and you can do the program part time over 2 years however I don't think there are many spots available for this.
4. You have a very defined transition into another career. Your first semester will be spent figuring out life at Harvard and your second semester will be all about finding a job. There is not a lot of time to test things out and see what you like. This is quite similar to other students I spoke to at MIT and the Kennedy school doing one year programs as you really don't have enough time to experience things like at 4 years of undergrad. Decide what you want to do in October at the latest and get as many skills and contacts in that industry/company as possible.
5. You already have a core skill i.e. programming, data analysis, financial modeling, graphic design etc. and want to transition into education. You can gain credibility in education within two semesters but don't have the time to master a ""hard skill."" The technology classes there coupled with a lot of outside resources can help but it will be a very busy year for you and will sacrifice a lot of the ""Harvard experience"" to do this. The motto on campus is that your fifth class every semester is ""Harvard"" due to the amount of activity on campus throughout the year.
6. The students who found work afterwards were typically doing roles such as curriculum designer, learning designer, community partnerships manager, non profit coordinators, education researchers and teachers. A few people went back to their original jobs in some form and a quite a few others are still looking for work a few months after graduation. 

Ultimately the consensus I've seen from alumni and colleagues is that it is a really enjoyable experience but may not be the most effective use of time and money unless you fit the above categories. Like many other roles in this day and age if you are really passionate about entering a certain profession there are many other ways of doing it rather than getting another degree.

I am updating the automoderator in response to some suggestions regarding Rule 1 violations. Thank you for the input! We should hopefully be seeing fewer blatant rule 1 violations from now on.

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further.

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

First, obviously Math 55 catches my attention and I would like to take it but I wonder if it might be too overwhelming for my first year. Does anyone have any insight into the workload for that class? If I am eventually going to be introduced to, in other math classes, all of the topics covered in this one class, I don't see it as beneficial to me to suffer through an accelerated class that throws it all at me at once. Can I learn all the topics covered in Math 55 through other math courses at Harvard spread across my undergraduate curriculum?


Second, is it common for undergraduate math students to remain at Harvard for their PhD studies as well? I am very interested in the work of one of the professors at Harvard on computational number theory. I was thinking I would like to study under him for my future PhD.

I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome.

Details in post. Here’s the abstract:

>	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

>	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

I'm curious to hear how Harvard alumni have chosen to maintain a relationship with Harvard after graduation, and what you've found most rewarding. Personally, I've wanted to maintain some type of connection, but life as an adult gets busy and complicated, and I often find that it gets bumped lower on the list of life's priorities.  I did alumni interviewing for some years, and found it rewarding to help out and to represent Harvard to applicants.  When I was back in the area, I reached out to a few student groups and did a few talks about the premed process.  I went to a few groups' meetings, but didn't keep that up.  I've been somewhat wary of official alumni association things, as my family's experiences with respect to spam, etc. has not been good.


I've thought about reaching out again to undergrads to pay forward some experience and see how I can help--even perhaps inconsequential stuff like bringing some people on a a Costco run for their suitemates--or informal advising, but am not sure how much anyone would want that kind of assistance or interaction.

Welcome home. Some important advice from Drew Faust Delivered by President Faust at last year's convocation address:

>Many of the most important ideas you will encounter over the next four years will not come from a professor or a lab or a book or an online assignment. They will come from those sitting next to you right now. Many of the questions you come to ask, the challenges you learn to parry, the new perspectives you come to embrace will be the result of your interactions with one another. This is why it is imperative that your class collectively represent the widest possible range of backgrounds, and experiences, and interests, the broadest diversity of geographic origins, socioeconomic circumstances, ethnicity, race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, political perspective. It is possible, in 2017, to accumulate enough information and pass enough tests through online learning to get a college degree. But we have asked all of you to uproot your lives, move to Massachusetts with carloads filled with paraphernalia and teary-eyed families forced to bid you good-bye. Why do we do this? We do it because we believe in the power of community as an essential educational force. But that community must be constituted so that it does not simply present you with what you already know or with people whose life experiences and outlooks are just like yours. It is its diversity, its elements of unfamiliarity, its elements of difference that render Harvard College the extraordinary experience that I know you will find it to be. We are excited to welcome you, Class of 2021, because you are in yourselves a great educational machine — destined to teach one another — and, of course, teach us as well — because of the variety of who you are and what you bring. When the admissions office decided on you, it was because they wanted your voice, your contribution as part of this creative cacophony. So don’t be silent. (And please don’t live your life online as if you weren’t here at all!) Engage with one another. Talk a lot so others can learn from you. Listen even more so that you can learn from them. Don’t be afraid to take the risk of being wrong. Don’t be afraid to admit you are wrong. It is the best way to learn and grow. And listen generously to others so that they may take risks too. Use the community of your fellow students as one of the greatest gifts and opportunities of your time here. Help us to build at Harvard a model of how people can be enriched rather than divided by their differences.

Again: Welcome to your new home!",1,450,44.33,95.42,39.59,72.45,17.31,21.11,90.89,73.56,58.89,16.44,10,0.22,1.56,6.67,0,1.11,6.44,14.89,5.56,1.78,14.89,8.67,4.67,7.56,1.56,15.78,7.56,5.33,6.22,4,0.89,1.33,15.33,0.44,14.89,3.78,2.89,1.33,2,1.11,4.89,0,5.56,4.44,1.11,0.89,0.44,0.44,0.44,0,0,0,17.11,5.33,1.11,1.11,0,0.67,0.89,11.33,0.22,0,0,0,1.78,0.67,0.22,0.89,4.22,0,0.44,3.33,0.22,0.22,0.67,0,0,0,0,0,0.22,0,0,0.44,0.22,1.11,0,0.67,0,0.44,0.44,0.44,7.78,6.89,0.67,1.56,4.89,0,0.89,0,2.67,1.56,4.44,1.56,0,0,0,0,0,14.22,4.89,5.33,0.22,0.67,1.33,1.78,0,,,

I'll definitely miss being able to study in Widener. That place has been a haven for my ability to focus - I'm so much more capable of working in there since it's so quiet and I have less distractions than home. That and it's a a gorgeous building. 

I also have little spots on campus I like to just sit at and read/study. The nook in the top of Sever's Film Library was amazing for that, as was parts of the Science Center.

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley.

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that.

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups.

Just wanted to share some stuff here for undergrads who may feel confused, anxious, and upset at everything going on with your TAs and instructors.

Most importantly, **do not let OSU lie to you.** Ed Feser had a field day with different percentages and stats in his all-student email, but if you look at the actual dollar signs (which he conveniently excluded) you'll see the facts. Our current minimum salary is **$1,762** ***before taxes***. For comparison, the minimum wage in Corvallis equates to $2,272/month, and the Corvallis livable wage for a single adult with no dependents is $3,519.20/month (per [MIT](https://livingwage.mit.edu/metros/18700)). OSU's proposed 10% increase to this minimum, in this context, means NOTHING. I've heard many people taken aback by the fact that we are asking for a 45% raise to the minimum salary. This would make the minimum salary around $2550/month. **A 45% increase is still significantly below a livable wage.**

OSU is also trying to remove our contract's 2-year reopener. Two-year reopeners not only allow us to re-negotiate in times of unprecedented change (as we did during the pandemic) but allows us to teach new union members how to bargain properly. **Removing the contract reopener is an attempt to restrict the union's bargaining knowledge** by only allowing us to bargain every 4 years. This is longer than the length of time that a typical master's student will even be at OSU and only allows PhD students to bargain their contract *once* in their entire duration here. In doing this, our new/incoming union members will be inexperienced when it comes to bargaining, as they will have never *seen* a bargaining session before- OSU will take advantage of this, and use our inexperience with bargaining to pass whatever contracts they want.

These are just two things we are fighting for. For deeper insight I encourage you to check out the union's [website ](https://www.cge6069.org/)and follow the union on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cge6069/). **OSU has made it clear that their goal is to spread misinformation, fear-monger, and weaponize undergraduates against us with misleading data and blatant lies.** Because of this, I personally recommend receiving all strike-related updates directly from the graduate union at the mentioned links.

Additionally, **you are NOT required to use the Canvas form to report your TAs for striking.** This is OSU's way of using YOU to do THEIR job. It's their job to determine who is striking, NOT YOURS. Using the Canvas form is considered actively crossing our picket line, as is covering our shifts/classes as an undergraduate employee. **Any time you help OSU, you are actively hurting us.**

**If you are interested in supporting your TAs during strike, here is a list of some things you can do:**

**-** Sign the [Undergraduate Support Letter](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/letter-of-support-for-coalition-of-graduate-employee-strike?source=direct_link&)

\- Refuse to report absent TAs via the Canvas link

\- Refrain from purchasing food, drinks, and other goods from OSU dining halls and cafes (if you have the means to do so)

\- Refuse to take on the responsibilities of striking grad students (primarily for undergraduate employees)- reminder that **covering for a striking TA is actively crossing the picket line**

\- Spread the word! Send your friends the Support Letter, share the Instagram page, make your voices heard!

\- **Join us on the picket line during your free time!** We meet at 10am daily and picket at the MU until 4pm.

\- There is also a [Faculty Support Letter](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/an-open-letter-from-the-faculty-at-oregon-state-university?source=direct_link&) if you know of faculty who want to pledge support to striking grad workers.

\- Share the [Strike Fund](https://account.venmo.com/u/CGE-OSU?catchAll=u&catchAll=CGE-OSU) and donate if you have the means to do so! Striking grads are not getting paid during this time; many of us need to afford rent, bills, groceries, child care, etc. Any donation is MUCH appreciated!

**TL,DR: OSU is actively spreading misinformation and trying to get YOU to do THEIR work. Their contract proposal will lock graduate workers into a lengthy and unfair contract that forces us into poverty and submission. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THAT and YOU shouldn't either! Spread the word, stay informed, and stand in SOLIDARITY with your TAs!**

So here it goes.

I sincerely apologize for how disorganized this subreddit has become. To put it bluntly, I have no clue who all is moderating this subreddit other than myself currently. I thought there were others, but the two mods I knew both left their mod positions and told me to figure out what to do. I’m really sorry about the state of some things on this subreddit recently. I have been doing my best to respond to any mod queue items I see, both to ensure rules are being followed but also to try to make sure that the subreddit is not banned for being unmoderated. However, I’m becoming overwhelmed with it. Additionally, I currently live and work on the other side of the planet and don’t think it makes any sense for me to be a mod here any longer. I am going to try to find out who else is a mod currently, as I don’t think everyone who is assigned as a mod actually manages this subreddit currently. 

Over the next couple weeks I will look into that, then sometime during winter break I will make a post about how to apply to be a mod. So I just ask for your patience until then.

As for the graduate student strike, I can assure that posts regarding the strike are not being removed by myself unless there are good reasons for it (i.e. if they break a subreddit rule). In fact, I am a previous PhD candidate at OSU and would have been joining in the strike as well if I were still a student there. However, based on the mod reports, it appears the Automod has been running rampant lately and removing posts, so I apologize for that. I will do my best to catch those in the meantime now that I know it is happening. 

And finally, thanks for being such a wonderful community (well, most of you are at least)!

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/oregon-state) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking. Also, since some courses depend on the professor, you can filter the reviews by professors and it will show you the average ratings for each professor.
Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.  (to leave a review, just search your course and you can submit a review at the bottom of the page)


Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

The cable lock for my wheels was cut and the wheels were stolen. seat slashed. cables cut. phone mount smashed. paint gouged. The other bikes on the rack were fine, it was targeted. I made a report. Even though It was outside a major residence hall there were no cameras.  It's insane how brazen the tweakers are here, I've had them smash into my friend's car just a block off campus during a game. I'm tired of seeing vagrants scouting the bike racks on campus and seeing mountains of bikes next to trash nests down by the dog park, both of which tell me that the issue is not being addressed and I am far from alone. I am sympathetic to the struggles of homelessness and addiction to what most people would consider a radical degree but I am not sympathetic to people who prey on people. I've had people in my life deal with homelessness and addiction and by their account they hated dealing with the tweakers more than I do.

I just published a [Chrome Web Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osu-rate-my-professor-ext/hgfogfefocfabnfjmjijfcjogeghmocn) that aims to ease your class browsing experience by directly displaying Rate My Professors reviews on OSU's class registration page. If you already use the Rate My Professors website when registering for classes, this extension will save you a lot of time.

It's simple to use! Here is a demonstration:

[Demo](https://reddit.com/link/15ihg3c/video/ivauljaes6gb1/player)

I am actively updating this extension, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know in the reply section! If you find this helpful, please consider supporting me by leaving a review.

Also, here is a link to the [source code](https://github.com/sebat2004/osu-rmp-extension) for anyone interested.

Edit: Rate My Professor reviews aren't always accurate, so take them with a grain of salt. I've found that positive reviews are often the most reliable. If you see a professor with good reviews, they're likely a good or excellent professor. The reliability falls off the lower the review because sometimes students let the grade they got in a class influence their opinion of a prof.",1,185,65.37,62.49,87,71.16,15.42,23.78,90.27,62.16,47.57,14.59,10.81,5.41,0,3.24,0,2.16,3.78,17.84,10.27,1.08,9.19,4.86,5.41,5.41,0.54,12.43,4.32,4.86,1.62,0,1.08,0.54,16.76,0,16.76,6.49,3.24,0,6.49,0,3.24,0,3.24,3.24,0,1.62,1.62,0,0,0,0,0,13.51,3.78,1.62,1.08,0,0,1.62,9.73,0,0,0,0,2.7,0,0,2.7,13.51,0,0,12.97,0,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0,0,1.08,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,7.03,8.65,0.54,1.08,5.41,1.08,0,0,2.7,2.7,3.24,0.54,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,20.54,4.32,3.78,0,2.16,2.7,7.57,0,,,

The GD program only allows 40 people in per cohort which makes it competitive. Despite how difficult it may be to get in, the program is extremely understaffed and the professors that do teach are heavily under qualified. Most have little to no professional graphic design experience in the field (1 professor only having an Etsy page for therapy based graphics as their only experience). 

Along with that you will also have a single academic advisor who will actively register you into the wrong classes and will provide you with little to no help on your route to graduate. I have gone to student advocacy multiple times to report this academic advisor but to no help as he has quite a veteran status within OSU. He also initially lied to me about the program promising future animation classes later in the junior-senior year of program, which was not true (I was transferring with an associates in animation, at the time) and pushed the major onto me, for what I assume is my out-of-state tuition. 

So why am I writing this? Mostly, I’m upset that I spent the last 4 years paying to learn and walking out learning nothing. It’s also worth to note that your credits for Graphic Design will not transfer to any school outside of OSU as it is a cohort, linear 4 year program. So once you’re in, there’s no going out unless you wish to fully restart at another university. This stopped me from moving back home (all of the GD classes must be attended in person) and prevented me from transferring universities.

I’ve always been frustrated with OSU and with the graphic design program.

Several of my colleagues and I have written an open letter, which we intend to send to Oregon's congressional delegation. If you want to sign it, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/jeiLHcGVQD4brsPY8).

([Link to letter in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dc_LmI_VneR4g-vTE5HOGrNRcBdV1RjGg5bipU-S0Yk/edit))

&#x200B;

*To: Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley; Representatives Suzanne Bonamici, Cliff Bentz, Earl Blumenauer, Peter DeFazio, and Kurt Schrader.*

*Dear Members of Oregon's Congressional Delegation:*

*Please ask your colleagues in Congress to stop introducing and voting for bills that:*

1. *Will increase computer and internet-based surveillance in the United States.*
2. *Undermine encryption, the bedrock of privacy and autonomy in our era.*

*The most recent example of such a bill is the EARN IT Act, which is currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee and other committees in the House. We urge you to vigorously stand against this bill.*

*It is our view that bills which enlarge the surveillance state of America's digital landscape or strip individuals of the tools to protect themselves in this landscape are ill conceived. EARN IT is one such bill. Among other concerns, these types of bills:*

* *Are impossible to implement or enforce, from a technical perspective.*
* *Criminalize ordinary and law abiding behavior, or sets the groundwork to do so.*
* *Violate the spirit motivating, and letter of, various Constitutional tenets that safeguard cherished and inviolable civil liberties.*

*We, the undersigned, are computer scientists. We can attest to the laborious and ultimately futile effort of curtailing encryption. Regardless of the merits (or lack thereof) of the public policy rationale for undermining encryption, the one charged with carrying out any mandate to enact anti-encryption legislation is charged with the job of Sisyphus on a digital hill. The task of implementing law or software to circumvent encryption will always end in vain in the long run, but the damage that will be done with every failed attempt to succeed will be very real.*

*Surveillance and anti-encryption pushes are often proposed under the auspices of real or imagined threat. In the particular case of EARN IT, the articulated threat comes from perpetrators of online child pornography. An enacted EARN IT Act, if not de-facto banning encryption, will create a chilling effect on the use of encryption. The ironic result will be a decrease of children’s online safety by making it more difficult to safeguard their data, along with everyone else's data, from unwanted attackers and snoopers. Anti-encryption laws serve only to make vulnerable the law abiding and embolden the predatory.*

*We affirm that technology which protects or empowers the many must never be stripped away from a free people because of the abusive actions of a few, no matter how abhorrent or heinous the abuse of that technology may be. Civil liberties of the digital world may not yet be enumerated in our nation's highest laws in plain text, nor fully vitalized by the nation's courts from the penumbras of well established offline legal doctrine. Yet these rights and liberties of the digital world are very much extant and inalienable, regardless of their recognition by the congress, the executive, the judiciary, or the tech titans of the day. Mass surveillance and anti-encryption movements desecrate these liberties.*

*We, the undersigned, are digital natives. We have lived with technology, developed it, and have an intimate understanding of its uses; we have seen technology bring out the best of humanity, and the worst. The world that will result from the enactment of bills like EARN IT is not the world we wish to live in, now nor ever. We believe that passing this bill, and others like it, will not only undermine individual freedom, but will also have disastrous collective consequences. Attacks on encryption, and an expansion of mass surveillance, are moves one would expect to find in an outpost of tyranny, not in a mature democratic republic, and certainly not in the United States of America.*

*We thank you for your longstanding interest in these issues. Please, stop this bill and others like it at all costs.*

*Sincerely,*

*\[Long list of signatures, including 40+ faculty and graduate students in computer science at nine of Oregon's universities.\]*

Here's an extremely long recap of my experience:

1. I attended the Colorado-Wazzu game Friday night, then drove back to Spokane right after the game. I had an early flight with a stopover in Seattle that was supposed to get me to Portland at 9am, so I was hoping to be in Corvallis by 11-11:30am after picking up the rental car and driving down from PDX. I had it all mapped out: I'd grab an early lunch at Local Boyz, grab a drink or four at Bombs Away, and then walk over to a tailgate that /u/Big_Box_O_Shine had invited me to attend. The Beavs would win, then I'd celebrate at Clod's, Peacock, or wherever else the night took me. But then...

2. My flight to Seattle took off on time and arrived as schedule. However, as we landed through fairly heavy fog, I actually thought to myself, ""Hmm, I wonder how they decide *how much* fog is too much to land through."" As it turns out, the answer was the thickness of the fog about 2 minutes after we landed. The Seattle airport apparently issued a ground stop due to the fog, so no flights were taking off or landing and I was stranded until the fog cleared. Once it did finally clear a couple of hours later, we had to wait for the actual aircraft to arrive from Portland so that we could take it right back to PDX. By the time all that occurred, my flight took off from Seattle over 4 hours after its scheduled departure time.

3. I finally landed in Portland around 1:30pm and was able to quickly get my rental car and make it to Corvallis around 3:30pm. I parked and headed immediately to the previously mentioned tailgate, where /u/Big_Box_O_Shine and his crew were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and fun. In order to make up for lost time, we (I, mostly) took shots -- oh, so many shots -- and crammed about 3-4 hours worth of drinking into 30 minutes while getting acquainted, talking football travels, and discussing the upcoming game. Spirits were high.

4. We walked over to the stadium and made it in time for kickoff, but I obviously missed all the pregame band festivities outside the stadium and only caught the tail end of the pregame on-field performance, which was a bummer.

5. Despite the cold and the rain, the atmosphere in the stadium was pretty damn electric IMO. Third downs were loud -- not just the chainsaw sound being piped in, but the crowd obviously disrupting Penix and the Washington offense at times. The student section was active all night, with their hard hats continuously bobbing up and down. I mean, the atmosphere was strong enough that it made a Southern boy forget that he was freezing cold and soaking wet, and instead focus on the fun of a Top-10 Pac-12 After Dark matchup in a great environment. That's a pretty high bar to clear. I also moved around a fair amount to experience the stadium from different spots, and every Beaver fan I met was friendly and enthusiastic. Fantastic fan base.

6. As for the stadium itself, obviously I have no previous experience to go on. I don't know if I would've preferred the nostalgia of its previous form by comparison, but seeing it for the first time as-is, I found it largely well-designed, attractive, and modern. Having walked around the entirety of the stadium (inside and out), I imagine recruits would find it impressive, as well. The size seemed perfectly suited for Corvallis and OSU -- large enough to create a fun, loud environment that exuded a big-time college football vibe, but not overbuilt for the size of the school and town.

7. The only area where I think the stadium comes up a bit short is bathroom availability. Considering the width of the concourses and placement of the stairwell/escalators, it seems like they probably could've budgeted a bit more space for restrooms, but I'm not an architect, so what do I know? Either way, it was still a relatively minor inconvenience in a stadium I still thought was fantastic.

8. As an unabashed lover of stadium singalongs and silly CFB things in general, I loved when ""Party in the USA"" was played over the PA. It was a random bit of fun in an otherwise intense game, with even the Husky fans around me getting into it. Then as soon as it was over, it was back to yelling and screaming when the Huskies had the ball. Loved it.

9. I really thought the Beavs had it. That last drive was going perfectly. Slowly matriculating the ball down the field, burning off clock with each first down. I had this vision in my head of 3 more first downs and a walk-off FG to win it. But then that 2nd & 12 throw down the sideline baffled me. At a point when OSU was moving the ball in small chunks pretty consistently, there was plenty of time left, and all 4 downs were gonna be used no matter what, I didn't understand the reasoning behind taking a low-percentage shot downfield. It basically took an extra down away and put all the pressure on getting 6+ each of the next two downs. It also made me sick to my stomach to look back and realize that a safety on an airmailed punt snap in a downpour was the difference in a game where Oregon State largely outplayed Washington. Tough loss.

10. After the game, I headed back to the same tailgate and commiserated over beers. I can't say enough about those fine folks. Not only were they extraordinarily welcoming and incredibly fun to hang out with, but their passion for the sport and for the Beavs was readily apparent. They are so passionate about their alma mater and have celebrated that passion for so long that it's impossible not to want to root alongside them.

11. When we got to talking about what's next due to conference realignment and all the issues it presents, it made my heart sink for both Oregon State and Wazzu. I changed plans and made this trip because I wanted to see both schools in person before the Pac-12 crumbles. Having now done so, it seems even more unfair and stupid and rage-inducing than it did from afar. Look, I've been to games between teams from the Sun Belt, MAC, AAC, etc. While I have a deep respect for those schools, appreciate the role they play in CFB, and love spending my fall weeknights watching their games on TV, it's just a different tier of football. I've also visited the vast majority of the Power 5 schools, so I have a massive baseline for comparison. There's no doubt -- **ZERO, ABSOLUTELY NONE** -- that Oregon State and Washington State belong in the upper tier. It sucks that schools like UCLA that already have the location, resources, historic stadiums, etc. and still can't cultivate a passionate fanbase get an express pass to the mega-money while y'all get screwed. There's no other way to say it; it just sucks.

12. After helping pack up the tailgate, I headed back to my car around 10pm. Once I got there, I realized my key fob had disappeared and spent the next 20 minutes in panic mode. I hustled back to the tailgate spot and fortunately the key was right at the edge of the parking spot where the equipment truck had been. It must have fallen out of my jacket pocket while loading stuff up. Disaster averted.

13. However, due to that delay, it was closer to 11pm by the time I got back to my car. I was cold and soaking wet, and due to the late planning of this trip, I couldn't find a place to stay in Corvallis and had to book in Salem instead. I still drove by the Peacock and Clod's to try to talk myself into powering through it, but the lines in front of each were horrendously long at that point, so I settled for a heated car and a stop at Riva's for a late-night bite before heading to the hotel. It was immaculate after a long day, and I can only imagine how much better it would've been if I were considerably drunker. So big thanks to those who commented on the previous post for pointing me in that direction.

14. On Sunday, I slept in a bit, took my time getting ready, and then headed back to Corvallis, arriving a little before noon. Extremely bummed that I missed my chance at Local Boyz because it's closed on Sundays, I grabbed lunch at a nearly empty Bombs Away. I then headed downtown and spent my afternoon slowly sipping beers at Sky High, Treebeerds, and Block 15. Continuing the theme, I again met great folks at each of those places and felt incredibly welcome in Corvallis.

15. After cutting myself off, walking around downtown & along the river, and grabbing some coffee (a rarity for me), I drove back to Portland for my evening flight. Since I had a redeye with a stopover in Salt Lake City, I decided I should probably go ahead and grab supper in Portland before flying out. I stopped by Botto's BBQ, which was recommended by the folks at Texas Monthly, and it did not disappoint. The brisket wasn't quite to the level of Matt's in Portland or some of the top places in Central Texas, but the ribs were spectacular and the two sides I had -- Hatch chili mac & cheese and Brunswick stew -- were also fantastic.

Overall, I had a fantastic time in Corvallis. It was unfortunate that a delayed flight and a slippery key fob limited my ability to maximize my time in town, but between my ill-fated trip for the Montana State game and the game experience of this one, it's almost like I've taken two half-trips that equal a whole. With that said, I think Corvallis is a great college town, so I would still like to come back at some point for a full weekend trip -- get in by lunchtime on Friday, have plenty of time to explore, take in the the Friday nightlife, tailgate all day, see some of the pregame festivities I missed, and eat my way around town (I can't believe I'm 0-2 on Local Boyz) before heading home. Meeting incredible folks like /u/Big_Box_O_Shine only solidified that desire, so huge thanks to him and his crew for being such great hosts.

Anyway, sorry for the obnoxiously long post. Again, my sincere thanks to all of y'all for the tips and the hospitality I was shown.

One last thing: I've been traveling all around the country for games since 2018, but this season I finally caved to my friends' encouragement and have begun sharing some of my travels publicly. So if you'd like to see pics, videos, etc., I've posted a long ""story highlight"" to my Instagram page (@cfbtravelguy), plus will be posting several Reels from the game when I've got some time to do some editing. I also post some videos on TikTok (@cfb.travel.guy) and plan to put together lengthier trip reviews -- basically this post, but in video form with some additional commentary and clips from my trip -- on YouTube (@cfbtravelguy) after the season when I've got some spare time. 

Feel free to check that stuff out, and if you have questions about other places I've been, don't hesitate to ask.

Okay I'm hoping to get this pinned, trending or something so I can come to the Department of Transportation at OSU with it.

The mismanagement of C parking is getting atrocious. I'm sure if you're in reser driving around for your 8-11 am classes you'll see everyone driving in circles and following people to there cars. This is not fair, and has resulted in people being late for classes or giving up and not attending (including myself)

Reser/ C parking is being oversold on top of giving spots to visitors for events and construction workers. We paid $100+ for our passes to not even be able to get a spot sometimes. I'm sure we signed something when we bought the pass of ""you aren't guaranteed a spot,"" but this shouldn't be a near everyday occurance. When plane tickets are oversold, alternatives are offered. We aren't even told when spots are roped off and are unavailable until we show up.

From 11/1-11/10 the back row of the side of reser along western and 26th is roped off. This is about 20 spots, not including the numerous spots in the line connecting the two lots that are blocked off due to poor pavement. 

This is just getting quite frustrating. As a student who has already paid tens of thousands of dollars to OSU on top of the parking pass, I feel it is ridiculous that I can't even attend classes sometimes because there isn't enough available parking due to construction that I at least know I didn't consent to. Our tuition is being used to build reser, which I didn't agree to, especially knowing I wouldn't be able to park easily most days. 

I think we should be informed on at least a weekly basis through email the status of parking ability based on events or temporary roping off of spots. I feel we should be allowed to park in other lots on some days.

I would love to hear what you all think. This feels classist to treat the cheapest parking pass so poorly.

I have a very odd request for help—my almost one year old daughter received this Oregon State beaver stuffy for a gift a few months back and it is her absolute FAVORITE toy/lovely, as you might be able to tell from the wear and tear.  Nothing puts her into a good mood or helps her sleep like hugging (or gnawing on) this stuffy.  I’ve been searching online for some backups, as we know babies lose things and I don’t want to be caught without a backup, and I can’t find anything remotely close to it online.  The gift giver purchased it on campus but is no longer there.  Anyone still on campus and able to see if there are any available for purchase?  They aren’t showing up on the student store website… any other suggestions on how to get a backup are much appreciated!!!

The water temperature is currently 52 F. Just watch and see how many people drown in rivers this weekend because they jumped in. How can you swim safely this spring? Wade in from a shallow area for 5 minutes. This gives your body time to adjust and minimizes the risk of the initial shock response, which is the most dangerous part.

[A study on the physiology of cold water immersion (cold = 50-60 F)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730683/)

>The lungs contract in the first few seconds followed by uncontrollable hyperventilating and loss of breathing control [79]. The heart rate, and blood pressure and cardiac output increase with simultaneous peripheral vasoconstriction [4,80]. The dynamic response is initiated by peripheral cold receptors, peaking approximately 30 seconds after exposure and adapting over about two minutes [81]. The initial shock and loss of breathing control is where the swimmer is at greatest risk of drowning and death is it requires very little aspirated water to initiate the drowning process [82]. Experienced winter swimmers become more resistant to the cold shock reaction through conditioning and progressive adaptation of the body to the cold regularly and with increasing frequency and gradual lowering of temperatures [83]. It is crucial to adapt and acclimatize to the initial shock response as it is particularly hazardous, accounting for the majority of cold water immersion deaths [75].",1,234,94.27,45.12,30.98,1.09,19.5,30.77,82.48,55.98,42.31,4.27,1.28,0,0,0.85,0,0.43,2.99,12.39,8.12,5.98,14.53,3.85,3.85,6.41,0,7.26,8.55,6.41,1.28,0,0,1.28,7.26,0,7.26,0.85,4.7,0.43,0.43,0,1.28,0,4.27,0.43,3.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.99,1.71,0.43,0,0,0,1.28,1.28,0,0,0,0,1.28,0,0,1.28,1.71,0.43,0,1.28,0.43,0,5.56,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.14,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.56,0,1.28,10.26,0.43,2.14,4.7,0.85,0,2.99,6.84,0.85,5.13,0,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,16.67,4.7,2.14,0.43,0,0,9.4,0,,,

# EMAIL FROM OREGON STATE

11 March 2020

Oregon State University is committed to state, national and global efforts to reduce the risk and spread of COVID-19, while appropriately continuing the essential activities of teaching, research, OSU Extension and engagement. While at this time, the public health risk in Oregon from the coronavirus is lower than it is in other states, we became aware today of a presumptive COVID-19 case in Deschutes County and testing for a possible case in Benton County is underway.

**Effective Saturday, March 14, OSU will move to a higher level of response that continues the essential operations of the university, but seeks to reduce the frequency of interactions among students, faculty, staff and visitors throughout all university campuses, centers, facilities and operations. Our focus is on continued university operations and social distancing.**

In taking these steps, we remain mindful and informed by the public health guidance of our local county health departments, the Oregon Health Authority and the CDC.

**Effective March 14, 2020:**

§  Campuses and OSU facilities and operations statewide will remain open.

§  Winter term finals week exams and activities will be delivered remotely where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

§  University academic and remote meeting tools, including Canvas and Zoom, will be used to minimize in-person meetings.

§  All non-essential OSU-sponsored travel will be suspended.

§  All OSU employees will be encouraged to work remotely where work responsibilities and duties allow.

§  All OSU students, faculty and staff are encouraged to avoid personal travel over spring break. Students should instead consider remaining at our campuses in Corvallis and Bend.

We are taking these immediate steps while OSU employees and students prepare to take expanded public health measures at the start of spring term.

**Effective March 30, 2020:**

§  All of the above actions are maintained.

§  All spring term courses, labs and exams will be delivered remotely, where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

§  Until at least April 30, no non-essential OSU-sponsored events of more than 50 attendees will be permitted. All events with fewer than 50 attendees will be held with maximum social distancing.

**The status of these measures will be evaluated every two weeks.**

We recognize such steps will prompt many questions and cause disruption. We ask for everyone to accommodate these changes, engage in and support appropriate support personal health measures, support as able other OSU community members, and frequently check the university’s [COVID-19 website](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus) for updated information.

Given that OSU plans that all university operations will remain in effect, we anticipate the continued employment and benefits for all employees. During this time, the university will seek to continue the employment of its student workers.

The following provides additional information regarding important aspects of OSU’s COVID-19 response.

**SOCIAL DISTANCING:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html) as avoiding crowds and mass public gatherings, and when possible, maintaining a distance of approximately six feet from others. Social distancing also means staying at home when ill, avoiding contact with people who have symptoms of illness, and not shaking hands.

**FINAL EXAMS:** Because OSU will administer final exams using a social distancing model, for those exams that must be held in-person, the university will seek to relocate final exams to locations where room capacity is three times the number of people registered to take that test. Faculty will notify students of changes in finals week logistics.

**REMOTE TEACHING:** Remote teaching delivery is when a faculty member facilitates the delivery of their in-person course instruction from a different location by using tools such as Canvas and Zoom. With the suspension of face-to-face meetings and the requirement for remote teaching, OSU will provide key resources available to faculty, staff and students. These include the following web pages: [Keep Teaching](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-teaching), [Keep Learning](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-learning) and [Keep Working](https://uit.oregonstate.edu/keep-working). If you have any questions or require any technology assistance, please [contact the Service Desk](http://is.oregonstate.edu/help). Additionally, there will be online and telephone resources readily available to help students navigate all aspects of online delivery, including Zoom.

Additional information on remote teaching is available for all students, faculty and staff within the university’s COVID-19 web page [“Hot Topics” under remote teaching.](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus/remote-teaching-learning-and-working-faq)

**SPRING BREAK:** We ask that OSU students, faculty and staff carefully evaluate Spring Break travel plans. If you are a student, please consider staying on campus or simply going home instead of traveling elsewhere during the break. OSU’s residence halls will remain open during spring break. If you are an employee, please consider remaining within your home community. We realize this may disrupt your plans, but broader travel within the U.S. and abroad brings additional risk of exposure to COVID-19, which includes the possibility of self-isolation upon return.

**EVENTS:** OSU’s future requirements regarding events is based upon the university’s interest in reducing the opportunity for COVID-19 to spread among people who gather in large public settings.

OSU recognizes that other universities, colleges, K-12 school districts, the state of Oregon and employers may at some time institute other requirements regarding the number of people in attendance at event. We also recognize that CDC guidance on crowd sizes may be different. In OSU’s case, university leaders believe that the facilities throughout the university can best accommodate our social distancing goals at a maximum of 50 people within OSU-sponsored events.

Information about the university’s COVID-19 response involving OSU Athletics events will be updated on Thursday, March 12.

Because COVID-19 remains a rapidly developing situation, it is important to check OSU’s page regularly, as well as advisories and warnings from the [U.S. Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) prior to finalizing personal travel plans and undertaking travel.

Please utilize OSU’s dedicated non-emergency COVID-19 information line, which is available to assist faculty, staff and students with questions at 541-737-7211. You can also seek information through the questions and non-emergency contact form on the [COVID-19 website](https://oregonstate.edu/COVID-19). In the case of a medical emergency, call 911 or a nearby emergency medical facility.

The best preventive measures for COVID-19 and any communicable disease continue to be the practices you undertake as part of your daily routine, especially during flu season:

§  Engage in social distancing;

§  Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with warm soapy water or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol;

§  Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with another person’s saliva, whether in your own living or social environments;

§  Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue; then discard the tissue;

§  Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to support a healthy immune system;

§  If you are not well, remain at home and contact your primary care physician, Student Health Services or a local emergency medical care provider.

During this time of public health concern and changes in OSU’s operations, please remain mindful and supportive of members of the OSU community who may be more directly affected by the coronavirus situation. Also, it is important that we remain a united community. If you witness any acts of bias or discrimination related to COVID-19, please report them to the [OSU Bias Incident Response](https://diversity.oregonstate.edu/bias-incident-response) team.

Thank you for your understanding and your continued work to keep the OSU community safe and healthy.

Sincerely,

Edward Feser

Provost and Executive Vice President

## Most OSU Corvallis campus fall instruction to be offered remotely and online

Dear OSU faculty and staff,

We write to announce important decisions regarding instruction for the fall term.

Based on careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU’s Corvallis campus will deliver most courses remotely in the fall, making it possible for students to live and study from home if that is the best option for them. This approach will limit the density of activity on-campus and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19 among students and employees.

Given OSU-Cascades’ smaller size, the Bend campus will offer a higher complement of fall courses on-site, while also creating remote learning options so that OSU-Cascades students also have a choice of where to live and study. A separate communication that provides information on fall instruction at OSU-Cascades is [available here](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/speeches-and-statements/osu-cascades-provide-variety-fall-instruction-modalities). The additional details we offer below apply to the Corvallis campus unless noted otherwise.

The decision to deliver instruction primarily virtually on our Corvallis campus was difficult. However, it is fully consistent with the principles we established in our resumption plan, which the Board of Trustees will review on Friday for consistency with guidelines issued by local and state health authorities and the Higher Education Coordinating Commission. While current conditions on our Corvallis campus remain at Level 2 of the university’s [four public health levels](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/s/tdml14g559oah972olzvwzs46d2e39gk), conditions are trending toward Level 3. Although the path of the virus remains uncertain, students, faculty and staff need clarity regarding fall teaching and operations in order to prepare for the term.

The university’s COVID-19 [Safety and Success website](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/) and [this video](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_oxupk2bk) offer details on what OSU will look like this fall. The following provides an outline, with a focus on instruction and student life. We will provide additional information on other operations in coming days.

**Choice:** To the greatest extent practicable, we are providing students with the ability to decide the location that works best for them to pursue their OSU studies. If a student feels safest living at home or off-campus and taking OSU courses remotely, almost all of our instruction will support that choice. If they choose to live on campus while they pursue their studies (mostly remotely and online), they are welcome at OSU.

Over 90 percent of OSU Corvallis course sections will be offered remotely. Courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs and field courses. Therefore, some students—especially advanced undergraduates and graduate students—may need to be in Corvallis in order to take those courses and continue progressing in their degree programs. The [OSU Schedule](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/) of Classes lists the instructional modality or format for each course: on-site/in-person, remote, a blend of on-site/in-person and remote, and online through Ecampus. Regardless of instructional modality, courses will be compelling and engaging, supporting students in achieving their academic goals.

**Living on campus:** Residence halls will be open to students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Capacity will be reduced to offer only single and double occupancy rooms and to create space for use in isolating and quarantining, should it be needed. We have adjusted our First Year Experience Live-on policy so that all first-year students otherwise subject to this policy may make the choice to remain at home. If students elect to stay at home and attend OSU remotely, no exemption request is required. Students with a current UHDS contract who decide to stay home must cancel their contract by emailing [housing@oregonstate.edu](mailto:housing@oregonstate.edu).

Buildings with classrooms and teaching laboratories for in-person instruction and applied learning will be open during fall term, along with the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, buildings that provide students with student services and study spaces, child care, health and wellness, food services and emergency assistance. Advising services will be mostly provided remotely.

**Living near campus.** We know that many students remain in and around Corvallis during the summer months while others will return to the area in order to utilize the university’s facilities, information technology infrastructure, and support programs while taking remote or online courses. Therefore, the campus will be open under modified conditions to support those students, and we will have public health measures and COVID-19 testing protocols in place. We ask all students, faculty and staff accessing the campus and living in the Corvallis community to be vigilant in adhering to OSU, local and state public health guidelines, and to participate in voluntary virus testing.

**Public health measures:** The multiple public health measures we have implemented include [physical distancing](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-040_COVID19_social_distancing) and [face covering requirements](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-041_COVID19_face_covering); enhanced cleaning protocols within university buildings; isolation and quarantine rooms in residence halls; improved HVAC filtration, where possible; expanded availability of hand sanitizer; and other public health measures recommended by local and state health officials. These measures are working well and have helped OSU to offer selected programs and services on-site and in-person over the summer.

**On campus testing:** We will test continuously for the prevalence of the virus that causes COVID-19 on the Corvallis and OSU-Cascades campuses and at the Hatfield Marine Science Center with the expert guidance of OSU researchers leading the [TRACE-COVID-19](https://trace.oregonstate.edu/) project. In addition to prevalence testing, we will monitor wastewater on our campuses and at HMSC for the presence of the virus. We are also exploring providing an initial test to students who choose to live on campus in Corvallis and students arriving from out-of-state hotspot communities.

**Financial assistance and student fees:** The OSU Board of Trustees froze tuition rates for the 2020-21 academic year for continuing OSU undergraduates enrolled in Corvallis, Bend, Portland and at Eastern Oregon University; we are increasing need-based financial aid assistance for eligible students; and we are preserving scholarship offers for students who elect to study elsewhere in the fall and return to OSU in a subsequent term. As well, fees associated with Student Fee-funded programs are now under review by student leaders. Information on any student fee reductions will be provided after the student fee committees complete their review.

**Research and Extension.** Campus-based research activities and fieldwork will follow existing resumption [guidelines](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/keep-researching) and on-site OSU Extension activities around the state will take place as local conditions permit.

We certainly had hoped that we would be at a different place in the national battle with COVID-19 by this point in the summer, such that we would be able to return to a significant complement of on-site and in-person instruction for fall term. However, we believe that by shifting to a primarily virtual instructional format, while also offering a limited mix of on-site teaching that facilitates students’ continued progress toward their degree, we will maintain a low density of activity on the Corvallis campus and help minimize the spread of COVID-19. Of course, we are prepared to pivot to fully remote operations if public health considerations dictate such a decision.

We sincerely appreciate the patience and understanding of all members of the OSU community as we adjust to ever-changing pandemic conditions and public health circumstances. Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health and success.

As resilient members of Beaver Nation, we will continue to respond, adapt and recover from these challenging times and become an even stronger community and better university for all we serve.

Sincerely,

F. King Alexander

Somebody else posted about this recently, but OSU administration is about to begin drastic reductions to the overall capacity of student health services, starting with the permanent elimination of the SHS pharmacy. *Some people* responded to the other post with some ""spicy"" accusations of phishing attempts....it was not a phishing attempt, and making accusations of such things is very counterproductive in this context. If you lack the patience to wait for someone to verify sources, don't get involved. 

  
Anyway, I ran into one of the SHS pharmacy technicians at Fred Meyer a few days ago. I knew this technician because they helped me acquire travel meds for an internship last year. They told me that the pharmacy was told without warning that they'd be closing at the end of the term. Apparently there was a degree of animosity between Grace Kuo, dean of the College of Pharmacy, and (I think) Jennifer Davis, the director of the SHS pharmacy; according to the technician, the director was defending the pharmacy, and that was one of the reasons she became a scapegoat. Apparently the director offered her resignation in exchange for the promise that the pharmacy would remain active, which was obviously not the case. 

The other piece of information the technician gave to me is that OSU is going to **permanently eliminate Student Health Services and replace it with a privatized service offered by Samaritan Health** in five years. 

Of course, the reasoning for both of these changes boils down to money. Despite that various university sports coaches are still being paid their exhorbitant salaries (even in the absence of actual sporting events), the fact that the SHS Pharmacy helps train students from the College of Pharmacy, and the fact that having a school pharmacy *might help a little during a global pandemic,* the pharmacy is somehow higher on the list for being eliminated.

As far as my source, I have every reason to trust the technician who gave me this information; this technician went above and beyond his duties to help me acquire the medication I needed for my internship last year, and was very honest about the realities of acquiring certain medications in quantity and the probability of my insurance covering them. For sake of protecting their future job prospects, I am not going to identify the technician; they are one of [the staff members listed at the bottom of this webpage](https://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/pharmacy), and that is the furthest I am willing to go. 

I don't know what  to do about this, and I probably don't have time to help very much with it. The only real idea I have for confronting this is that some of the organizations that help fund the College of Pharmacy might not like to find out that the school is getting rid of their own pharmacy to save money instead of pulling funds out of their expensive sports programs. The SHS pharmacy is a very direct means of training students who want to become pharmacists, and it's hard to frame the loss of the pharmacy as anything other than a loss to the students in the College of Pharmacy, and to the university as a whole. 

I don't know if it would work, but if someone could demonstrate to the organization(s) providing funding to the College of Pharmacy that OSU has degraded the functionality to the college for the sake of saving money, it might make the donors/grant committees a little unhappy.",1,595,90.2,25.56,33.67,20.23,33.06,24.87,89.58,67.9,56.81,11.6,5.71,3.19,0,0.17,0.5,1.51,5.88,19.33,11.43,0.84,17.31,7.23,4.2,3.87,1.34,13.61,4.71,3.87,3.53,1.34,0.17,1.85,11.93,0.5,11.43,2.69,1.68,1.01,2.52,0.84,3.19,0,3.36,1.68,1.68,0.34,0,0.34,0,0.17,0,0,9.08,4.37,1.68,0.34,0.67,0.5,0.67,4.87,0,0,0.34,0.17,0.34,0,0,0.34,7.39,0.5,0,5.71,1.18,0.17,4.37,4.2,0.17,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.17,0.17,0.84,0.67,0,0,0,0.84,0,4.37,6.05,0.17,1.01,4.2,0.34,0,0.17,3.03,4.2,3.87,1.85,0,0,0,0,0,13.45,4.37,4.03,0,0,1.01,4.03,0,,,

Hi guys!

Attached to this post you will find a link with a google drive containing PDFs for certain courses at OSU.

It might help someone save some $$$ so I just wanted to throw it out.

If you have any PDFs you would like to add let me know! I would like to establish a library users can come back to if needed!

Dear OSU Corvallis students,
 
We write to announce decisions regarding instruction for winter term for the Corvallis campus.
 
Based on continued careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 pandemic locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU’s Corvallis campus will continue providing instruction primarily through remote modalities for winter term 2021. Winter term plans for the OSU-Cascades campus will be announced by Oct. 15. 
 
We will continue to use remote delivery to contribute to student wellness and educational success, limit the density of activity on-campus and in the Corvallis community, and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19. As with fall term, courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs, field courses and some graduate courses.
 
By the time registration opens in mid-November, the OSU Schedule of Classes will list the instructional modality for each course, as determined in consultation with academic units. Our aim is to limit the need for students to change where they live based on how winter term courses are offered.
 
We plan to have the following building open on the Corvallis campus during winter term: those with classrooms and teaching laboratories used for in-person instruction and applied learning, UHDS residence halls and dining centers, the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, Valley Library, and other buildings that provide child care, Student Health Services, food services, emergency assistance and study spaces (such as LInC). OSU updates the open/closed buildings list regularly. Student advising will continue to be provided mostly remotely.
 
Residence halls will continue to be open for students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Students who chose to remain in their home community during fall term but wish to live on campus for winter and spring terms are welcome to live on campus. Visit University Housing & Dining Services’ or email housing@oregonstate.edu.
 
As we plan for spring term, we will closely monitor COVID-19 conditions and if possible, provide increased in-person instruction, extra-curricular and experiential learning opportunities for students. We will communicate more details on spring term as winter term is underway.
 
Winter term tuition and fees will be the same as fall term. Student fees for the academic year will be based upon recommendations from student leaders in Corvallis and at OSU-Cascades.
 
Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health, safety and educational success. Thank you for being a resilient and responsible member of Beaver Nation.
 
Sincerely,
 
F. King Alexander

Are their any requirements or other guidelines on what sort of experience or background (etc) for teachers/instructors/professors?

I thought we were paying for (at the very least) and getting a quality education but at the same time I have had teachers that are using material from 10 + (+++?) years ago and others that have absolutely no experience, education or any apparent relevant background in topics that they are teaching. How is this acceptable?

What about material that is relevant to the world today (not outdated)?

Do you find this to be true as well?Do you find this to be disheartening?

What can be done about it?

In reality we are the customer/client paying OSU et all for an education but why is it that we have no say in the quality of this education?

It's been able to fill prescriptions for 9,000 students every year, and OSU want to shut it down forever.

To address our unprecedented global and immediate need for access to reading and research materials, as of today, March 24, 2020, the Internet Archive will suspend waitlists for the 1.4 million (and growing) books in our lending library by creating a National Emergency Library to serve the nation's displaced learners. This suspension will run through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.
During the waitlist suspension, users will be able to borrow books from the National Emergency Library without joining a waitlist, ensuring that students will have access to assigned readings and library materials that the Internet Archive has digitized for the remainder of the US academic calendar, and that people who cannot physically access their local libraries because of closure or self-quarantine can continue to read and thrive during this time of crisis, keeping themselves and others safe.

To say that it's fair to charge this much for remote teaching ""Because it's not ecampus"" is ridiculous. Our community is working so hard to provide so much for its citizens and yet nothing has been done to help with tuition forgiveness/extension.

Are there any other students who are frustrated about this? In my case, I can't even go home because I'm from Washington, and the majority of the out-of-state students here are from California and Washington.

It seems like many of us are thinking the same thing. OSU is announcing of some classes in person to keep enrollment from plummeting. Now the thing is, I do think they are trying their best to keep classes on campus. But in reality, I think it’s risky to bring back thousands of people from all over back to Corvallis. The 8 week term idea is great. I always found the weeks in between thanksgiving and finals to be quite awkward. But I’m sure they know that with a influx of people returning to Corvallis, there’ll be people celebrating/catching up at bars(if they open) and quite a bit of parties, especially in the first couple of weeks. It’ll be hard to enforce social distancing when people haven’t seen their friends in months & with many living in the same house. So I’m curious to see how that will be handled. I mean, I’m all for people living their lives, but for those who are trying to be safe and cautious, it’s going to be hard.

I feel bad for the incoming Freshmen. They’re signing up for most, if not all, of their classes being online since they’ll be taking prerequisites with way more than 50 people in the class. It sucks that OSU is still encouraging dorming knowing that most of their classes will be online. If I was an incoming freshmen, I would start at CC this fall & transfer when classes are back to on campus normally. 

Based off my own class schedule for the Fall, I’m only on campus for a couple days a week as most of the lectures are already scheduled to be delivered remotely. But, personally, I find it quite annoying that I’m only going to campus for a recitation and a lab. I find it more annoying because these classes can be done remotely. I guess it’s just that I have to fly back to Oregon for 8 weeks & go to campus for 2-3 days just for lab and recitation. I know it’s my choice to do so, but if I don’t, then I push off graduating next spring. 

I feel like a lot of people are going to be in similar positions. Lectures are going to be 
delivered remotely, but recitation and labs will be on campus. What are your thoughts or concerns? I’m curious as to what others are thinking.",1,422,46.32,12.64,98.44,26.43,17.58,16.11,94.31,77.01,59.72,14.69,9,5.69,0.24,0.24,0,2.61,5.69,12.09,4.5,1.42,17.77,12.8,5.21,6.64,0.71,23.46,7.35,6.64,2.61,1.18,1.18,0.47,13.98,0.71,13.03,5.21,0.95,1.18,2.84,0,4.27,0,2.84,1.66,1.18,0.95,0.24,0.71,0,0.47,0,0,6.64,2.13,0.24,0,0.47,0,0.71,4.27,0,0.24,0,0,0.71,0,0,0.71,6.87,0.71,0.24,5.92,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0.95,0,0,0,0,0.71,0.47,8.29,10.66,0.24,3.08,7.35,0.47,0,0.95,5.69,2.37,7.58,3.55,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,15.88,5.45,4.27,0.24,0,4.03,1.9,0,,,

This protest was entirely peaceful. Nobody threw anything, nobody broke anything, nobody looted anything, nobody assaulted police. Simply walking and chants.

* Protests of nearly equal or even larger size have occurred with a small UTPD presence and resulted in 0 arrests or disruptions (such as one on Nov. 9). Students attending reasonably expected they were acting legally.
* Student protestors planned a peaceful ""sit in"" in a public, outdoor, and spacious part of the university complete with guest speakers and study breaks.
* State Troopers showed up at 11:40 in riot gear when the protests hadn’t even began, so they couldn’t have been responding to violence.
* State Troopers let people march for an hour on speedway (basically just a massive sidewalk on campus) and randomly declared the march illegal at 12:40 for ""blocking a roadway"". They ordered people to disperse but also blocked people from leaving.
* When people then moved to south mall to not block speedway, they then declared all of south mall illegal to be on. They pushed the crowd onto sidewalks and created a danger of students being trampled
* Students got an email from UT Austin that declared anyone in the south mall area to be a rioter at 5:18pm
* After fencing the normally publicly available south mall off, police jumped over their own fences to arrest random people not on the mall, but on the sidewalks. They arrested compliant students, a Fox News journalist, an elderly protestor, and shoved around many professors.
* Troopers then declared the entire sidewalk off limits, and pushed the students from the sidewalk onto a street, blocking it off with a line of bike cops and horse police.
* For the first time in the day people students were actually obstructed, but not by protestors: UT staff and cops banned anyone from south mall, it’s sidewalks, and blocked a street off next to it with bike cops. If they tried to get to class using any of these routes, a cop (not a protestor) might slam them.
* The state troopers and APD randomly left around 7pm. (I have no idea why they would turn their backs on “violent rioters” without being attacked, calmly walk away, and let the ""violent rioters"" go back to a campus)
* Protestors returned to the south mall after 7pm. They did the same thing they would’ve done if the police never showed up: sat on the mall chanting while people freely walked by.

Why did all of this happen? This was an unconstitutional political stunt by Greg Abbott. He sent the troopers in advance to disrupt any pro-Palestine events on campus, even if legal & peaceful.

They didn’t just wait until violence occurred before sending riot police. Because they knew violence likely wouldn’t break out, and therefore they wouldn’t have a reason to arrive.

They didn’t simply order police to arrest violent individuals, because there wouldn’t be any, and they wouldn’t be able to disrupt the event. This is why they declared an entire area illegal.

This was a pre-planned attempt by UT Officials and Abbott to silence people peacefully protesting. Abbott said it himself on Twitter; he believed UT students belong behind metal bars not because they hurt anyone, but he dislikes what they think. Abbott did this to score points with his party and donors.

Shame on UT officials for going along with this anti-constitutional political stunt and getting students heads slammed on concrete, people’s futures jeopardized, and professors shoved around by cops so Abbott could get some favorable headlines.",1,574,79.75,60.78,34.03,4.9,20.5,23.34,84.32,61.67,49.48,7.84,4.7,0.17,0,0,0.87,3.66,3.14,11.32,7.49,2.09,15.68,5.92,4.7,7.67,2.61,12.72,4.7,2.79,6.62,1.22,0.7,4.7,11.67,0.52,11.15,1.22,2.09,1.57,3.31,0.35,3.66,0,3.66,0.87,2.79,1.22,0.17,1.05,0,0.52,0,0,13.41,3.66,0.17,0,1.57,0.17,2.96,9.93,0,0.17,0,0.87,0.7,0.52,0,0.17,5.05,1.74,0,3.31,0,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.7,0,0.17,0,0,0.17,0.17,4.01,10.8,0,2.79,7.67,0.35,0.17,0.17,2.79,5.92,0.7,0.87,0,0,0,0,0,18.12,5.05,4.36,0.17,0,1.92,6.62,0,,,

This post is very long, and I'm sorry. Please bear with me. I have held off making this post for months, because after hearing stories of some of the cults on campus harassing/following/threatening people who leave, I didn't want to create any content that could be traced back to me. But I feel bad that I haven't said at least something. I hope that new or old students who are considering joining this group will see this post and at least be informed about what they are getting into. **PLEASE read this post through to the end if it could apply to you at all, because a lot of the problems with this group are fairly well hidden.**

I am a freshman. When I came to orientation at UT, I was extremely lonely. I tried to talk to people and got very cold responses. I couldn't make any friends, wasn't interested in parties at the end of the day, and generally spent most of my free time calling my family and non-UT friends. That was until, as I wandered around in Jester trying to figure out where I was supposed to go, a friendly guy came up to me and asked if I was lost. He pointed me in the direction I was supposed to go, and handed me a flier for an ice cream social that CSOC was putting on. It sounded fun, so I decided to go. Everyone there was very kind, although they did immediately ask for my name, phone number, email, and home address on an ipad on the way in. I felt accepted. The students there literally sat in a circle around me and talked to me for hours. I was tangibly the center of attention lol. Sounds narcissistic, but it felt nice after what felt like constant isolation since I had arrived. Later I noticed them asking every freshman they could if they were lost and handing them a flyer, which slightly weirded me out, but I didn't think too much of it.

Literally 6 or 7 people from the group wrote me when I got back to my dorm that night. I set up lunch with two of them one day, and ""Bible studies"" (a misleading term) for the rest of orientation. Free food. Constant texts from people I now saw as sort of friends. Friendly faces around campus. It was great! Something felt a little off about how invested this group was in me, but I pushed it aside. As I returned home, I kept getting texts, and a couple of the older members said that the org was divided into many smaller groups that did Bible studies together. They asked if I wanted to join theirs, and I agreed. We started calling every night, fairly late and for a long time (like 10 pm to 2 am sometimes, WAY longer than a normal Bible study. The Bible studies were structured like this: one of the older students would pick a chapter, and we would take turns reading verses from it. After each verse, the older students would all give (suspiciously identical) interpretations of what it meant, and I was sort of just supposed to listen and ask questions if I wanted.

Here is the most important part. I kept noticing that things they read from their Bibles were different from mine. My translations is very standard (ESV) and I have read the Bible many times. I also competed in speech and debate (including Apologetics, a theology-based event) throughout high school. I know the Bible very well. So I was surprised to notice that a large amount of the verses they read were slightly, but meaningfully, different from what I was reading. I brought this up, and they told me ""Our version is similar to the ESV, just more accurate."" Their version is something they called the ""Recovery Version,"" a translation that no Christian reading this will likely be familiar with. More on that later. I asked them if that meant my Bible was wrong, and they said ""no, but ours is for people who want to know the truth more deeply."" They basically told me that my Bible left things out and was for beginners who aren't enlightened yet. This is deeply troubling and also heretical because the Bible is supposed to be the inspired word of God. These are translations, not different books. But theirs was more correct than mine? They strongly encouraged me to buy one of these, which are only sold by ""Living Stream Ministries,"" every chance they got. They also made a point of having us read footnotes for every verse, which didn't add context like normal footnotes, but literally laid out an interpretation of the verse.

I was really bothered, however, when they told me that the Bible mandates there be only one church in each city that presides over all Christians. The passage they quoted from their Bible to support this was just *straight up* *not in my Bible at all.* The same verse said something completely different. They literally told me that denominations are sinful because they are causing division in the Church and creating separate religions. This is when I started digging. They had told me their group was nondenominational and had Christians of all types, from Catholic to Reformed. This isn't strictly true. 99% of the group goes to a church called ""The Church in Austin."" I thought this was just a quirky name, until I dug a little deeper. They literally believe they are *the* church in Austin. The only one. The others are all fake and evil to them. CSOC is a name that mostly comes up in connection with UT. But the group used to be called ""Christians on Campus,"" which is much more common. All of these groups are tied to a church called ""The Church in \[whatever city\]"" and all of these churches are part of a cult called the Lord's Recovery. When I confronted them about this, they straight up lied and said that they are not tied to any denomination, while still affirming that only their church was valid out of all the churches in Austin. This turned into a 6 hour cross examination of them by me, in which all of my lines of questioning inevitably led to them asking me to go with them to meet one of the elders and have him sort out my questions. Thankfully, a friend gave me the good advice to not put myself in more situations where they outnumbered me, so I did not agree to this.

After I got off the phone, I looked *very* carefully into The Lord's Recovery and realized I had dodged a bullet. They have some fucking insane beliefs. Their founders, Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, are considered to be the divine oracles of God and the footnotes they add to the Recovery Version are taken to be divinely inspired, basically scripture. They also more or less segregate men and women, with occasional events in which the two interact. The group believes in ""courtships"" within the group only, and approved by leadership only, so basically arranged marriages. They're to be kept secret until the two are engaged. The Lord's Recovery bought a $6 million cemetery to have their members buried in, because they consider others unclean (even other Christians, if they're not part of the group.) The ""Recovery Version"" is not a translation, but basically a group of people led by Lee and Nee correcting the Bible. This is when it dawned on me: the reason I was the only person who needed their Bible passages explained to me was that they were just indoctrinating me. Their ""Bible studies"" were a crash course on the basic theology of the group. Everything ended with another ""Bible study"" in which they prayed for me at the end. The prayer was bizarre and disturbing, and they literally warned me that their prayers are ""different"" before starting (not a red flag at all.) The prayer was basically one of them moaning a bunch of stuff, interspersed with ""ohhhhhhhhhh Lord Jesus"" or ""pleaaaaase, God"" from the other one. It sounds funny, but the other guy legit sounded like he was having an orgasm the entire time. It was freaky and kind of comical. I GTFO after that prayer and told them I wouldn't have time for more Bible studies until after classes started. As soon as I moved in, I had CSOC members asking where my dorm was, what my dorm number was, and whether I wanted them to bring me housewarming gifts. They also invited me back into the Bible studies, which of course I declined. This kept going for over a week and I eventually stopped responding. A little while later, so did they.

The group boils down to a recruiting wing for The Lord's Recovery. After you graduate, if you stick with the group, you are expected to go to an expensive school at one of their churches for two years where you learn to be a clergy member in The Lord's Recovery, and the whole free food and love bombing system disappears. You are required to wear a suit at all times and prohibited from interacting with the opposite gender. Others have done long content on what it's like to be a member outside of college, I will link some of them here:

Edit 2: CSOC and the Local Church take PR very seriously. Don't believe them when they tell you they're not a cult. [this article from the cult itself](https://christiansaroundcampus.com/christians-around-campus-cult-or-genuine-christians/) accuses a 1990 Daily Texan article of libel and slander for calling them a cult. That same article calls the Texan an offensive, opinion based publication that pushes agendas, and cites a *now dead rival newspaper* as its source. Zero integrity, and real Christians don't lie like this. 

I'm kind of scared to see what happens after I post this. The last person who made a post talked about getting followed by members online and in person. But I felt I needed to tell the whole story. The problems with this group go far beyond UT Austin and the students here. I dodged a bullet from a group that has international roots and a history of sexual abuse, isolating its members, heretical teachings, and financial exploitation.

I asked where in the lease it says it and they couldn’t tell me. 

They told me to email the block and I did. I was told they can try to switch me out but no guarantees. If they can’t put me in a room with all girls then can I break out of my lease? It’s unsafe for me as a girl only with all guys. I am even SHARING a room with a guy. Does anyone have any ideas? This is super unsafe and I have a partner.

EDIT1: Update: Got told I can’t break the lease even if they can’t solve this issue and they’re trying their best with room situation. Going to escalate even further now because why can’t they protect a girl if they can’t solve an issue like this?

Thanks all for the comments and suggestions! Escalation will happen.

UT doesn’t have affirmative action based on race, it’s almost entirely the top 6% rule which allows anyone at the top of their class to get into UT , regardless of the amount of resources their school has. There’s also some affirmative action in employment based on veteran status and if you were in the foster care system (which is the law). Race is asked when you apply for a job but it’s just for documentation purposes. The people actually reviewing your application don’t see that.

DEI at UT provides support for people who need it the most in college. Including low income students, students of color, first generation students, and queer students because they are far more likely to drop out. Being at UT was the first time I had any kind of community for queer people of color and having that support is a large reason I succeeded at UT. You can read the statistics on your own but dismantling DEI is like dismantling disability support laws and removing the wheelchair ramps from campus or not letting dyslexic students use reading software. We start off on an uneven playing field and we need more support to get by.

Also you can’t just blame the laws for this because the departments that have been shut down *were* SB17 compliant. The MEC was SB17 complaint and it was shut down anyway. The GSC was SB17 compliant (it was merged with the women’s center) and it was shut down anyway. Which is particularly ridiculous because 90% of what the GSC was provide education on gender and sexuality. If college is supposed to be a space for learning why are spaces to *teach* being shut down?

And even if we’re being completely profit focused, this still hurts UT as an institution. Without support for marginalised communities there will be more minorities dropping out, so retention rates will drop. More people will fail classes, so 4 year graduation rates will drop. Rankings will drop. Less students will attend. Especially when the values of the university continues to show it doesn’t care about its students.

Especially with the change in tenure laws, UT is going to have a much harder time retaining talented students *and* staff/faculty. I’m personally moving out of Texas completely for my PhD because the actions of both the state government, and university leadership make it an unsafe place for me. And I don’t want to start a PhD at a place where my mentor could be fired at any point and I could lose years of work on my PhD.",1,460,53.41,51.73,27.24,32.27,19.17,18.91,90.22,67.17,56.74,10.43,5.65,2.17,0.65,1.74,0,0.87,4.78,13.48,7.17,1.74,14.35,11.96,5.65,7.17,1.74,18.48,5,5.22,6.3,1.52,2.17,3.04,13.26,0.22,12.61,0.87,3.48,1.96,2.61,0.87,3.7,0,3.04,1.96,1.09,0.22,0,0.22,0,0,0,0,10.65,3.48,1.3,0,0.22,0.43,0.43,7.17,0,0,0.22,0,1.09,0.22,0.65,0.22,8.7,0.22,0,8.48,0.43,0,0.65,0,0,0,0,0,0.43,0,0,0.43,0.22,0.43,0.43,0,0.43,0.43,0.43,0,6.09,9.57,0.22,1.96,6.3,0.87,0,0.22,1.74,3.26,5.65,2.17,0,0,0,0,0,13.48,5,2.17,0.22,0,3.26,2.83,0,,,

Every now and then I would have someone who obviously doesn’t speak English hand me a card saying they’re a student at UT struggling to survive and need help. 

For one thing, it’s obvious to me that these people are not UT students. It’s ok to not know perfect English but whenever I try speaking back at them, they just give blank stares. How these people could be UT students while not knowing any English is beyond me.

Furthermore, it’s always different people but with the same MO. They all wear the same outfit and look like students. They all look like they’re in their upper 20’s or lower 30’s. Same pamphlet. Same “gifts” (crackers or cookies). 

I’ve also had this happen to me in multiple occasions in different locations. They’ve come to me in different floors of the PCL and even around midnight at the EER. 

Some are even a bit aggressive. Just a few minutes ago one lady of this group solicited me and whenever I had to respectfully say no (I’m hella poor) she left in a huff. On the 4th floor of the PCL mind you.

At this point I’m worried about their safety. It could be that these people are not even aware of what they’re doing and are being exploited by some exterior group.

This is creepy to me. I’ll make sure to provide pictures the next time they approach me.


Edit:
After doing some research using the additional information given to me from the comment below. We were able to track down one of the solicitors to a “news anchor” called Princess Laranas using one of the venmo handles they use for donations. This lead us to their official Facebook profile.

Princess Laranas is a news anchor for this group called SMNI News. SMNI is owned and operated by Swara Sug Media Corporation which is the parent company of Sonshine Media Network International. This company is the broadcasting arm for Filipino televangelist and church leader Pastor Apollo C. Quiboloy.

Besides making grand claims such as being the “Appointed Son of God” and being the “Owner of the Universe”, Mr. Quiboloy was also accused of brainwashing a former church member, and was indicted for sex trafficking.

Mr. Quiboloy is the founder of the church “Kingdom of Jesus Christ”. This church practices tithing which has made Mr. Quiboloy very wealthy.

Besides that, the church is also guilty of human trafficking, abuse and are required to meet tithing quotas (which is probably why they’re soliciting us for money)

Domino has been wheezing and having trouble breathing for the past week or so. 

Although he is very resistant to trapping, [Cats of West Campus](https://www.facebook.com/catsofwestcampus/posts/4887666241287347) caught him tonight and took him to the vet.

He has an upper respiratory infection, which has affected his lungs as well. Unfortunately, he also tested positive for [FIV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feline_immunodeficiency_virus). He was having trouble fighting off the respiratory infection due to reduced immune response from the FIV. 

It is pretty common for outdoor male cats to have FIV. He probably caught FIV at some point in the last few years (since his last vet visit) from fighting another male cat. He has had fight wounds a couple times in the past year. (We tried to take him to the vet to treat the wounds, but he was just impossible to catch. We treated him with antibiotic ointment and his wounds healed without requiring a vet visit.)

There were much more immediately dangerous possibilities, such as heart disease or cancer. His breathing sounded so bad, the vet warned me that chances could be grim. So I consider this diagnosis to be pretty good news. 

He is currently fostering with a UT employee, crashing in a bathroom so he can get some rest and medications. Hopefully the antibiotics will knock out this infection. He is in good hands. Huge thanks to his foster for doctoring him!

I paid $1,000 for the vet bill and will be posting a gofundme soon. God bless the fine folks at Pet Specialists of Austin!

The Domino Council has not made an official decision, but due to Domino's advanced age (approx 13 years old) and FIV+ status, I personally believe it is time for him to retire on a comfy couch. He deserves a happy retirement and easier access to vet care the next time he gets sick. Living outdoors brings many risks and dangers for any cat. He has had a good long run as undisputed King of the Campus. 

We will continue to keep you posted with any news. 

Get well soon, little buddy.

Long Live Domino!

I propose ""Shartzell"" instead, for a couple of reasons. 

1) Farts are benign and not all that embarrassing. Yes, Shartzell is loud, unexpected with his proclamations, and it all stinks. But that doesn't fully account for the mess and the cleanup involved when he flaps his sphincter. 

2) SEO. If you search ""Fartzell"" you'll only probably find that word. And if you search ""Hartzell"" you are unlikely to find results for ""Fartzell"". However, ""Shartzell"" contains the Prez's actual name and would mean that a ""Hartzell"" query would include ""Shartzell"" results. 

I could probably come up with a couple more reasons, but I'd love to hear from others and discuss. 

Let's make Shartzell trend for this man who invited DPS to our campus in a fashion that even GOP senators had questions about and over-complied with SB17 in order to lick boot. Abbott's favorite puppet deserves a name that fits. 

Not to mention the continuing layoffs over ""reputational crises"" because the Marketing professor can't manage the UT brand unless it's playing into culture wars.

Yesterday some friends and I who do not participate in this sort of thing walked to Cabo Bob's and had to pass Fiji's house. You could barely see the turf under all the beer cans strewn everywhere. Two cops were outside staring at the mess and barely said a word. The house and the nearby restaurants were surrounded with drunk guys and even drunker looking girls, swaying like they could barely stand and making complete fools of themselves. Trash is everywhere in West Campus and every group of people you walk by smells like alcohol. We watched people vomiting in a parking lot and saw kids who looked younger than us passed out on the side of the road. It's disgusting. 

This is all Greek life is good for. It is the worst part of American university life. That's the truth. I don't give a shit if this comes off as judgmental or self-righteous. That's because it is. Frats are horrible and abusive to new members and cause problems for everyone else, whether that's physical or sexual assaults, or bringing extraordinary amounts of drug and alcohol use to campus. Sororities funnel girls into a hierarchical pattern of social thought and are toxic and shallow, and their interactions with frats frequently end badly for the girls at these kinds of events. As someone else mentioned in a post a few hours ago, there are girls being abused at West Fest parties and turned away because of weight or looks. All this on top of West Fest's racist history and the poorly hidden histories of many of the orgs that it consists of. I would not be comfortable with my family being on campus right now because they would be horrified at the degeneracy and blatant sexism and horrible behavior. 

People say frats and sororities and parties are worth it because of ""connections"" and ""making a guaranteed friend group"" but that's a bunch of bullshit. If these are the kinds of people you want to be friends with or be connected to, your priorities are in the wrong place. West Fest and Greek life at UT (just like most elite universities, it's not just us) is shameful and detrimental to the school's environment. People who participate should feel embarrassed for partaking and the school should be embarrassed for endorsing it.

West Fest isn't fun. It's sad, pathetic, and trashes the campus. We should be better than this. 

Edit: I turned off post notifications and am not responding anymore. It seems the narrative has shifted to “you just didn’t get invited loser, go ahead and sit inside all day while rich people have fun.” This kind of criticism blatantly misses the point, as 1, yall don’t know anything about me, 2, needing to get wasted and demean women to have fun is actual loser behavior, and 3, West Fest/Roundup has been causing real harm to women, minorities, and random attendees who get caught in the crossfire for a long time. It’s documented. I don’t dislike it because I didn’t get invited. It’s hard to get invited to things you have literally no connection to or interest in. I dislike it because it is degenerate and has historically caused a lot of harm. I’m not making headway by responding to these people. If calling people losers for not wanting to pass out on the side of the road in our own vomit or get tased by frat boys makes y’all feel better, I feel sorry for you.

We all know that some of the members they place outside of church are quite literally harassing people and it’s really disgusting to see, and even more disturbing knowing what the cult actually is.

Are there any efforts or organizations that are working to evict the church from UT campus area? Is there any legal leverage at all?

The amount of exclusion I’ve felt since I moved here is debilitating and has affected my academic life and ability to socialize. Coming here is genuinely one of the costliest mistakes I’ve ever made. In my time here, I’ve seen everyone go on and live their lives and love it and haven’t experienced even a bit of the fun they talk about. I’m making a broad generalization here but I’m fairly sure, my experience will apply to most black students here. You’ll start to think you’re the problem if you stay here long enough. The degree and job opportunities really aren’t worth it. I know a lot of will disregard this, whether out of lack of other options or something else, but if there’s even just one person who reflects on this and decides not to come here, I know I’ve at least helped one person out. 4 years is a long time of feeling like this so make sure you think twice. Worst thing about it is that nobody will care how you feel, your voice will be drowned out by all the other people having the best time of their lives while you suffer in silence. I realize this isn’t a problem unique to only black people but Austin is one of the most economically segregated cities in America and has a deep history of systemic racism rooting back to 1928 that still has great effects today so we’re affected in more ways than we can actually see or measure. Everyone’s experience is different, just wanted to voice out my experience for posterity and future classes who might come across this post. 

I only see all this getting worse after SB17. There’s a reason why African Americans are leaving this city at such a fast clip.

Mentally ill people, people with poor/no English, people who are isolated and seeking community such as exchange students.

They also love to create front groups that seemingly have no connection to Scientology itself. Some actual names of such groups are ""Youth for Human Rights International"", ""World Literacy Crusade"", and ""Computer Ethics Institute""

A more realistic scenario is that an exchange student applies for what he thinks is an internship and they ask for him to sign an interest form, take a uniform, and hold some key immigration/ID documents overnight to process his application. When he returns, they don't give the documents back and point to something buried in 20 pages of the form saying he will do hours a week of ""volunteer"" work for them. They also say the uniform they gave him is worth $2000 but he can choose to work instead of paying for it. If he calls 911 they just say they've never seen him before. (Actual story)

Another example could be a student who moved away from their family to UT to avoid their Scientology ties now finds themself being recorded and followed by Scientologists on the way to work or class since the ""grand reopening"" to pressure them to rejoin.

Saying ""just don't be an idiot and make wise choices"" doesn't suffice as a solution to stop the influence of a sketchy organization near campus with decades of experience of using legal trickery and harassment to gain members and harm people.",1,295,60.01,80.82,12.81,34.55,32.78,24.41,89.49,65.42,50.85,12.2,9.49,1.02,0.34,0,3.05,4.41,2.71,12.54,6.78,1.02,13.22,7.8,3.39,7.8,2.03,15.25,5.76,3.39,5.76,1.69,2.03,2.03,10.17,1.36,8.81,3.39,1.69,1.02,1.36,0,1.69,0,3.39,2.03,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.34,18.64,6.1,0.34,0,0.34,1.02,2.03,12.2,0,0,0,3.05,2.03,1.02,0.34,0.68,8.14,0,0,5.08,0.68,2.37,0.68,0.68,0,0,0.68,0,0,0,0,0.34,0,1.02,0,0.34,0,0.34,0.68,0.68,7.46,5.76,0.68,1.02,4.07,0.68,0,0,4.75,1.69,6.44,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,13.22,3.05,3.05,0,0,1.36,5.76,0,,,

I was living in an apartment with my girlfriend (at the time) doing my homework, when suddenly she tells me “I found the answers to my chem midterm online and used them yesterday during it.” I was speechless, she could tell I was having a hard time processing this so she walked into her room to give me space.

During all this shock, I smelled something burning from another room and heard the apartment’s fire alarm go off.”Will! There’s a fire! Help!” I heard my girlfriend shout. Now I was stuck in a conundrum -- report her to the academic integrity office, or put out the fire in my apartment?

It was at that time, I remembered UT's famous focus on Academic Integrity, and I wanted to protect the culture of academic integrity in order to reinforce quality teaching and learning at UT Austin. So I ignored the fire and my girlfriend’s pleas, and started writing out an academic integrity report before I could forget.

But all of a sudden, the smoke in my apartment cleared and the fire alarm fell silent. My girlfriend walked into the room, and to my astonishment, peeled off a wig and revealed herself to be Jay Hartzell himself! “Im proud of you for upholding and excelling Academic Integrity,” he said, and gave me a free HealthyHorns condom and a 'Make It Your Texas' sticker.

I was lucky enough to get EMS attention, even though their bitch ass made my fiancée pay for water WITH THE TIP SCREEN. The fucking audacity… my fiancee said “I have never pressed the skip button so fast.” I took some from their stash of cold water bottles for that. Fuck them.
Anyways, the ceremony was so badly managed that it basically became a hazard to be there. While I was leaving the medical area, my fiancée witnessed a group of people carry their unconscious friend and get rejected medical attention because they were full. 
Not only was the medical area severely understaffed, but the crowd control was also badly managed. Instead of having people in a line, security basically had people in South Mall packed like sardines behind a barricade; the perfect recipe for another AstroWorld incident. People were pushing each other, starting fights, and raiding the barricade. And the weed smell was very prominent and headache-inducing. 

Jay Hartzell wants to hire a SWAT team for a peaceful protest because he has “a responsibility to keep the campus and its people safe”, but can’t even staff enough security and medic to control this shit show of a ceremony. So much for keeping his word, am I right? 

Edit: Don’t be hyper focused on the fact that I almost fainted. I take responsibility for that and I’m in healthy condition right now for those who are concerned ☺️ Like I said, I was LUCKY and am thankful to even get medical attention. 
But y’all are missing the big picture here. My intention was to highlight my concern of how badly managed the event was, even to the point where security gave up.  Even someone’s daughter got trampled and her mother had to take her to the ER. South Mall was so packed that it was almost impossible to get out of. Even my fiancée who didn’t need any medical attention knew this was a hazardous situation to be in. This could have been mitigated if there was more staffing and better event planning. The event organizers should have expected this a while back when they were hosting a free, public event that had an international star.

I had to rush to my class as I was late, otherwise I would’ve definitely held his arm and guided him all the way. He did have directions on his phone and would listen to siri for guidance.

This past Wednesday, UT President Jay Hartzell informed Ann Stevens, the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts, that he would not allow her to continue for a second term:

[https://www.statesman.com/story/news/education/2024/10/02/university-of-texas-dean-says-jay-hartzell-wont-let-her-seek-second-term/75488355007/](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/education/2024/10/02/university-of-texas-dean-says-jay-hartzell-wont-let-her-seek-second-term/75488355007/)

To add further perspective, at the end of August, Hartzell suddenly fired UT's top academic officer (his provost, whom he had chosen himself) and replaced her with the very inexperienced Dean from the College of Communications.

In her email to CoLA (College of Liberal Arts) department and unit managers, Dean Stevens wrote the following:

>Dear Colleagues:

>I am writing to let you know that Jay Hartzell informed me yesterday that he will not allow me to be considered for a second term as Dean.  The reason he gave was that I did not have a grand enough vision for the college.  While I disagree with that assessment, it is clear that he and I have different values and different goals for the college. 

>I am not yet sure of any details about the timing of appointing an interim dean or of starting a search. I have the option to serve through August 2025, when my term officially expires.  I will let you all know as soon as I have more information about plans for the next COLA leader.

>With your help, we have made enormous progress in COLA: building academic excellence; improving research support and infrastructure; investing in student funding, research, and career support; and supporting a culture of respect and care for staff, faculty and students.  I am attaching the two documents I prepared for my review.  They are not relevant for that purpose any longer, but I do hope they will reassure and remind you at this difficult moment of how well the college is doing. You should have no doubt that COLA is in a very good place today.

>I want to encourage all of you, as college leaders, to continue to focus on what is in the best interest of yourselves and your units, and to continue to carry out that mission through what will be another challenging transition.  I will do everything I can to help with that. This news feels terrible to deliver via email, and I am looking for a time in the very near future to be available for some in-person conversations.   I’ll be in touch.   Jay will apparently be emailing all COLA staff and faculty later today, but you should feel free to share the information in this note with your staff and faculty colleagues.

>Thank you so much for all that you do for the college. It’s an honor to work with all of you.

>Ann

If a Dean wishes to continue to serve in their capacity, it is customary for their performance to be reviewed by a committee composed of constituents of their College at the end of their first term. Dean Stevens makes clear that Hartzel **is not allowing that review to take place**, and he is doing so without any public explanation.

Donors, alumni, and students had better wake up and let their thoughts be known to the UT Development office and directly to Jay Hartzell: [president.hartzell@utexas.edu](mailto:president.hartzell@utexas.edu)",1,542,67.65,64.07,31.72,63.84,27.1,23.25,90.04,65.31,55.54,14.21,9.78,3.69,0.18,2.4,2.03,1.29,4.43,14.94,5.9,1.11,16.24,8.67,2.77,5.72,1.29,14.39,5.35,3.14,7.38,1.66,1.66,3.87,12.92,1.11,11.44,3.69,1.48,1.48,1.66,0.37,2.77,0.18,4.24,3.51,0.74,0.55,0.37,0.18,0,0,0,0,14.21,4.8,1.66,0.18,0.18,0.18,1.85,9.23,0,0,0.55,1.48,2.03,1.29,0,0.74,9.23,0.55,0,8.49,0.37,0,1.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.92,0,0,0.55,0.37,0.55,0.18,0,0.18,0.18,0.92,4.06,5.35,0.74,0.18,3.51,0.74,0,0.55,5.17,2.95,3.32,2.58,0,0,0,0,0,15.68,4.43,4.43,0,0.18,0.55,6.09,0,,,

- Sending in state troopers not once but twice to violently assault students and drag them by their hair across the main lawn who were peacefully protesting, so the governor could tweet about it
-Punishing these students even though the charges were dropped and blocking them from having access to things like transcripts and then having the university publicly accuse a local elected official of “political grandstanding” for not charging our students 
- Firing more staff in the comms department for not being able to defend his trashy actions
- Turning the university into an events venue disrupting classes (e.g. CMT awards) and then accusing protestors of disrupting classes
- Ending flexible work arrangements for staff who can’t afford to live in Austin while laughing in the face of staff and senior staff who ask him for data to support such a notion and denying staff pay raises while talking about raising historic amounts of money

I've been seeing a lot of posts about what to do *inside* your home during this weather, but not much on what to do if you actually have to venture *outside* your home. So I'm giving my two cents as someone who managed to survive to adulthood in the north.

Here's the thing: the *number* of layers you have isn’t necessarily what matters. Wearing three pairs of leggings isn't going to feel much different than one pair of leggings. What matters is the *shape and size* of the layers. What keeps you warm is the air between your clothes staying warm.

Shirts: You're going to want at least two layers, but definitely more than that. Make sure that you have at least one layer with tight-fitting wrists and a close-fitting collar, because that will keep warm air in and cold wind out. If you're an athlete and you have those sweat band things that go on your wrists, those are a really good way to keep the wind out of your sleeves.

Shoes: If you have any kind of boot, now is the time to wear them. If you only have normal socks, wear two or three pairs of them. If you have those thicker fuzzy socks, wear those. Yes, even if they have funky patterns. The same rules apply if you only have sneakers, but godspeed soldier.

Pants: If you own leggings or tights, put some on under your jeans or sweats and you're good to go. If you don't (like me), pick your tightest sweatpants and baggiest jeans (or vice versa) and wear those with the baggy pants on top. Tuck your inner layer into your boots (if you have them) or your socks (if you're wearing sneakers). This way, you can keep the wind off your skin while your outer layer hides the fact that pants look really weird when tucked into socks or boots.

Other Accessories: Hat. If you don't have a hat, wear a hoodie. Gloves. If you don't have gloves, pockets. Scarf, wrapped around both your neck and face. If you don't have a scarf, dig out the face masks from COVID and wear those. It keeps the cold air off your face. Lastly, have space in your bag to put some of these layers once you get inside, because you might start sweating to death otherwise.

Coat: If you don't have a winter-ish coat, you probably have a polyester windbreaker or something. It might seem pointless. It's not.

I am editing this because ppl seem to believe my post is about defending myself. If you click the petition above, nothing about my activism involves clearing my name. Here is the statement you could read if you actually clicked the link:

This week I, an autistic student with 0 monthly income, was chased, harassed and then reported to authorities by an official dining employee for leaving JCL Residential Dining Hall with an 8oz cup of self-serve cantaloupe. Today I received an official accusation from The Office of UHD Residence Life for violating my housing contract by removing food from a residential dining hall without permission from an employee. Despite most generous dining hall employees allowing small items like cups of fruit, small plates of dessert and drink cups to be taken freely from the halls, this female employee has not only caused an immense amount of stress on my life, but also placed my future at this university at risk over a cup of “unlimited” fruit included in the $6782.88 I have paid for the “convenience” to live AND eat here.

The University of Texas at Austin currently enforces an unjust policy prohibiting students who have paid for a meal plan from taking food from a residential dining hall without first paying $7.50 per meal (on top of a base $5 program registration fee) to receive a to-go container with the Eco-To-Go program. Statistics show that 1 in 3 UT students face food insecurity, yet residents paying to live AND eat at campus owned dining halls are forbidden from saving “free” food to eat at a later time or at another location. With these policies, students without an income or access to groceries, or those who have run out of dine-in-dollars and bevo pay, do not have access to food during any hour that does not fall between 7am-9pm on weekdays, 7am-8pm on weekends, or during the 2pm-5pm preparation breaks that dining halls often take.

This dining policy–implimented in 2021 following the pandemic–which allows students to be reported for violating housing contract, is ludicrous and quite frankly, contradictory to everything UT Austin claims to stand for. The money hungry changes to dining rules made in order to promote the unaffordable Eco-To-Go program need to be undone. Please sign and share this petition to urge the University of Texas at Austin to allow students the freedom to eat the food they have paid for.

I have deleted the personal anecdote which was shared in hopes you would find comedic relief in the insane enforcement of a fruit cup AFTER reading the link I included. But since it is clear to me ppl are not willing to click links, I will make it easier for you.

If it’s your first year at UT and you’re not from Austin, you may have heard that homelessness is extremely bad in the city. Unfortunately, this is true. 

This post isn’t meant to dehumanize or bash any unhoused - especially those who are mentally ill. However, the recent heat wave is greatly exacerbating mental health issues and increasing aggression. It’s important to know which areas in the city to avoid.

You will not see many (if any) unhoused people ON campus - especially during the day. This changes the closer you get towards Guadalupe St. Please be careful walking down Guad at night - don’t be scared, just very mindful of your surroundings. Avoid the sidewalk area next to / behind Dollar Slice Club at night. 

In West Campus, there are some incidents every year along 22 - 25 Streets. 90% of the time, this is just an unhoused person going through a mental health crisis and screaming / making gestures at bypassers. It’s intimidating, but physically harmless. Don’t interact, just cross the road and try to pass as quickly as possible. 

There are many encampments in wooded areas. Be very careful while walking / jogging in Shoal Creek, Zilker or any Greenbelt areas. A large encampment is also in the woods behind the Starbucks at the Barton Creek and S Lamar intersection. Be careful around there. I’ve had several bad interactions both on foot and in a car. 

6th / 7th St is just flat out dangerous right now, both at day and night. AVOID THE UNDERPASS I-35 INTERSECTION THERE AT ALL COST! Generally, be very, very mindful of your surroundings while walking/driving downtown. 

Overall, please remember that the homeless are also people. Therefore, TREAT THEM LIKE PEOPLE! Many are very polite and will graciously accept any food / clothing that you can give. Don’t live in ignorant fear, just use your best judgment and be knowledgeable about the Austin area.",1,339,50.12,45.3,74.97,5.58,13.04,20.35,87.32,67.85,53.69,7.67,4.13,0.88,0,2.65,0,0.29,3.54,14.16,5.6,2.06,13.57,9.73,9.44,7.08,1.77,15.04,7.67,5.9,2.65,0.59,0.59,1.47,12.39,0.59,11.8,1.47,1.47,0.88,3.24,0.29,2.95,0.29,3.54,0.88,2.65,1.47,0,1.47,0.59,0.29,0,0,6.78,2.36,1.18,1.18,0.29,0.29,0,3.83,0,0,0,0,0.29,0,0,0.29,2.65,0.59,0,1.47,0.59,0,3.54,2.36,0,0.29,1.77,0,0,0.59,0,0.29,0.29,0.59,1.18,0,0,0,2.36,0,7.37,15.34,0.59,2.36,11.21,0.29,0.59,0.29,3.83,1.77,6.78,1.18,0,0,0,0,0,19.17,7.08,4.72,0,0.59,2.65,4.13,0,,,

But my friends and I went to the silent disco tonight at Greg. It was pretty low key, but enough people for it to feel safe and such at night. Plus there’s always some people out on speedway at night anyways. So my friend and I are chilling on the side and this guy comes over to sit with us. Initially he seems chill, kinda interesting, whatever. First red flag was that he didn’t even go to UT. He said he was giving his friend a tour of Austin and stopped by campus. Second red flag was that he was obviously significantly older than us and actually showed excitement (ew) when we said we were freshman/sophomores. Then, when we asked him what he does (since he’s apparently not in school), he literally says “you don’t want to know what I do.” Finally after a really awkward few minutes of him calling us “party girls” and “freshies” he asks if we want to go get smoothies?? We both don’t really answer and I think he FINALLY gets the vibe and says he’s gonna go find his friend (who he said was this dude dancing in front of us.) Well when he gets up he goes no where near his “friend” and actually just walks away to a nearby staircase where he sits down and stares at us. 

THEN a group of girls (who were the best people ever like thank you so much for checking on us) comes up to us and repeats everything he told us because he had tried the same lines/story on them JUST BEFORE US. Asking to get smoothies and everything. Lemme just say that gave me freaking chills. We waited for him to get up and leave before even considering walking back to our dorm. 

Anyways. This is tame compared to some situations, I get that. But I just had to say something because I’d never want to hear that some girl actually took him up on the smoothie offer and something happened. And no, there really wasn’t an option to “report” him or anything  as the whole thing was just students (even though I’m honestly thinking I should’ve done more). But just please be careful.

So, last night there was an accident by cain and Abel's. A board fell from a building (I've heard the one directly behind Cain and Abel's that's under construction, but unsure) and landed on a guy's head, severely hurting him. Myself and a couple nursing students did our best to take care of him while the ambulance arrived— God Protect him but he was unconscious and not doing well. 

What I want to know, is who can I reach out to regarding the board? The board was massive, at least 50 lbs, maybe a hundred.  It was improperly secured— it looked like all that was holding it up was tacking nails hardly as long as the board was thick. I'm furious because I think whoever improperly secured that board is responsible— likely a construction company. 

Whomever was hit by the board deserves justice and compensation for what may be extensive hospital bills. I don't know if the patient is even conscious now, or what his situation is, so I think it would be good to reach out to some sort of authority to get the ball rolling on an investigation. Beyond that, he may be a student, so for various reasons (including the possibility the building was a university owned or affiliated apt) it'd be good for the university to know. Would it help to reach out to the dean of students? file a police report? who else would y'all recommend reaching out to?

I am a graduating senior and about an hour and a half ago finished up my last class. I feel nothing and everything at all. I still remember so much, and have gone through an incredible transformation over the last four years here. I wanted to write down my story briefly for you longhorns; I hope you feel comfortable enough to share something as well. 

I come from a small town in Texas, and about only four of our class came to UT. I roomed for three years with one of my best friends, and came into college in a relationships with my then girlfriend. We broke up mid-way through the first semester and it absolutely crushed me. I spent a lot of time isolating, lamenting and being dejected. I was a pretty bad person and so I felt like it was punishment for me to suffer and not enjoy college. I spent most of my time my first two years just studying. I did not make many friends, and the ones I did make I did not keep up with. I played in a sports club but I only made two good friends (still good friends with both). However, most of my time was miserable - I put on weight, struggled with becoming a better person, felt like I didn't deserve much and just wanted to suffer a lot. It was the only sensation I felt really strongly. I didn't have any friends to confide in and just didn't feel like it was worth it. Although this never hurt my studies - I really enjoyed my classes and felt like my professors were the best people in my life. Additionally, I spent much time reflecting and keeping up a journal (which I still do), and reading books. These two things kept me afloat, and actually made me a better person.  

But I realized that holding grudges against myself was wasting so much energy - I was tired of being so sad on purpose and living a miserable life. I started to eat right, work out in the mornings, took up a part time job on campus, and started saying ""yes"" to life more often. Life didn't change magically change or get amazing - but it did get better. I made a few more friends, got nice internships, expanded my network, stayed healthy, got back into my numerous hobbies, went out more and just...lived life. I never did anything I didn't want to, or felt pressured to do something. I made many great memories, and I am thankful for my pain because it gave me wisdom and through that I grew. I am proud of what my four years meant to me, even though it wasn't the most ideal. All my friends have been supportive in their own capacities, and I have grown close to many professors. Everything isn't fine and dandy, but it is better. 

And now it has all come to an end. I really don't know what will happen with commencement. I really don't think it will go through if I am being honest. I am upset my parents won't get to fulfill their own dream of seeing their son graduate and walk. Or that I won't get to take pictures with my professors and friends at graduation. I plan on writing a letter to every professor, TA, and friend that inspired me and meant something to me. This isn't the end of things though. I will also be back here for my dual Master's program, so I am very thankful I don't have to part ways with Austin and UT yet. This isn't the way I imagined it, but that is okay. I have achieved so much, and I have so much to achieve.

I have actually gotten dumber since I've come to college. Every day I look at the calendar and every day there are more and more assignments due at all hours of the day. All of this for what? A piece of paper so I can work a desk job until I die? I'm tired of ""education"" just being a bunch of nonsense. To accurately define how I feel on a daily basis I have chosen a meme that is most fitting: ""Thomas had never seen such bullshit before."" I know there are others that feel exactly the same way.

Anyways, that concludes my spill.",1,180,38.08,1,97.42,2.17,15,18.89,90,75.56,61.11,15.56,8.33,8.33,0,0,0,0,7.22,17.78,6.67,0.56,15,12.22,7.78,5,1.67,19.44,6.11,8.89,1.11,0,0.56,0.56,15.56,3.89,11.67,3.89,1.67,1.11,0,1.67,3.89,0,3.89,0,2.78,1.67,0,1.67,0,1.11,0,1.11,2.22,0.56,0,0,0,0,0.56,1.11,0,0,0,0,0.56,0,0,0.56,8.33,0,0,8.33,0,0,1.11,0.56,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.56,0,0,1.11,0,0.56,0.56,0,0,0,8.89,6.67,0.56,0.56,4.44,1.11,0,1.11,8.89,6.11,7.22,0,0.56,0.56,0,0,0,14.44,5.56,0.56,1.11,0,4.44,2.78,0,,,

I hadn't intended my original tweet to get nearly half as much attention as it did, when I asked if anyone wanted to join it was half me making a joke, half me actually asking. When everyone started asking to join I capped how many people I was going to add to a server to about ten. Im fairly new to Minecraft, so I didn't know how to add anyone to my server at first (process is actually more complicated than I thought), or whether there was a limit to how many people I could add (is there a limit?). A friend and I are currently in the process of getting the Minecraft UT server started, and we'll add as many people as possible. 

I've only been able to complete the outside of Parlin Hall, half of the outside of Calhoun Hall, the courtyard in front of the tower, and a little bit of Littlefield Fountain (not pictured cause it's looking rough so far, she's a work in progress.) It's taken me about four months, this is more of a side project that I like to work on when I have time on my hands. The trees have been a deterrent honestly it's so annoying to make them.

The repica is not perfect, I don't think it's to scale and I'd like to work on that. If anyone has any tips on how to make this whole process easier, any apps I could download that would help the building/add more items I can use to make it look more realistic, or if they wanna go ahead and add some floor plans for the buildings so I can get started on the inside of Parlin Hall/Calhoun Hall that would be awesome!

Because I am super low income, I want to take advantage of this, but I have two concerns.

1. As a school as small as Williams, is it even available? If it is, how costly is it? I know that it says health *insurance* is covered under my scholarship, but I'm not sure how extensive that would actually be.
2. I also read on the website somewhere that the student care centre (or whatever it's called idk) is closed during the summer. I would assume that this means that care is both on campus and that it is not available during the summer, so would that effectively mean that care is not provided during the summer or that it is simply used for outside services instead of simply the on-site location.

If anyone on this sub knows or knows a resource where I can found out in more detail how this works kind of in advance I would appreciate it.

My state senator went to Williams and when talking to her offered to write me a rec letter and do a interview with me for the school (I don’t think they can do that though). I originally had my heart set on Hamilton and I still like it a lot but after touring Williams the other day, I fell in love with everything about it. I am a Questbridge applicant so if I become a finalist it’s out of my hands (Williams will be ranked #1 and Hamilton #2 probably. Might change rankings but other schools will be ranked as well) but if I don’t become a finalist which I am expecting to happen, how should I go about applying to Williams? Hamilton has been very clear about wanting students that want to be there badly and I’ve heard people who love it there, but Williams was mind blowing and I don’t know what to do. I have good stats everywhere else but I didn’t do as well on my ACT as I was hoping which is giving me a hard choice over what to do for ED. I have safeties planned out but I’m nervous one action I take will mess up the other and any advice or suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated.

Here are my stats:

Low Income (Indian-White) Student in high income academic area

Parents are seperated/Father is absent

Oldest of 4 siblings 

4.0 Unweighted GPA (94.5/100)

No class rank

27 ACT (debating on test optional need advice)

I have 143 CS Hours, NHS, CPR/First AID Certification, Cum Laude on the National Latin Exam, and a few other local awards

10 APs (5s in World and USH, 4s in Lang and Psych)

3 Jobs through the YMCA to support my Family and be involved in the community (Camp Counselor, Child Watch Assistant, and After School Care provider) 

Youth Ambassador for the NYS Youth Mental Health Advisory Board where I advocate, research, and campaign for youth mental health which has resulted in me writing and contributing towards bills set to pass in NYS regarding mental health in education and schools (My state Senator who runs the board went to Williams and offered to write me a Rec Letter for Williams, she’s awesome)

President of a School Teaching Club where I teach students how to design curriculums, organize and shadow teachers for classroom experience, meet with school officials at other districts, organize school supplies drives for low income students (I don’t know how much $ we raise in supplies but we get a lot), earned the club a program with Nazareth University for teaching, etc.

Advisory of a Military History Club where me and a teacher organize and design interactive Risk like battle simulation board games for members to learn about Military History and Strategy through fun ways

I did Rowing for 2 years (would do club if possible)

I have a Animation portfolio that has earned a few school art awards and a spot in the RIT Start Here exhibition

Member of Red Cross Club, Pre Med Club, GSA, etc. (probably some other stuff I’m forgetting)

TL;DR: what should I do based off of my stats if I don’t match for Questbridge. Should I ED to Williams, Hamilton, RD or something else? Do I go Test Optional?

I’m currently a high school senior and plan to major in pure math with the goal of eventually pursuing a PhD. Since I’ve maxed out my high school math courses, I’m currently taking linear algebra and abstract algebra at a nearby university.

I’m mainly focusing on applying to R1 universities (for Fall 2025) that offer opportunities to take graduate-level courses and explore various advanced math topics.

I’ve heard great things about studying math at Williams College, but I still have a few unresolved questions. If you are (or were) a pure math major at Williams, I’d really appreciate your insights.

Here are a few things I’ve learned from reaching out to faculty (in plain text), but I’d love to hear your experiences (my questions are in bold text):

1. Williams offers 400-level (also known as senior seminar) courses that are similar to graduate classes. These courses change every semester, ensuring that students always have access to upper-level classes. **What was your experience taking 400-level courses as an undergraduate? Were you able to explore different areas of math? Were there enough class offerings?**
2. Williams provides opportunities to conduct original research with faculty, which can lead to publications. **Have you written any papers that were published with a reputable organization (as an undergraduate)?**
3. Research opportunities and thesis work are primarily available through Williams’ summer program (SMALL). **I understand that students from other colleges also participate in SMALL. Does Williams reserve a certain number of spots for its own students? What was your experience with the SMALL program?**

I also would like to mention that I prefer attending classes with other students so that we can exchange ideas. For now, I’m not particularly interested in pursuing independent study to self-learn a math topic.

Lastly, when I toured Williams in February 2024, we passed through a building where math classes were being held (I can’t remember the name). What struck me as odd was that most of the classrooms were empty, and the two classes that were in session had only about six students each.

I'm considering applying here as my ED, and I was wondering if I could ask a few quick questions about the school! 

  
1) I'm worried about the small size of the school - I attend a high school (<100 per grade), and feel incredibly stifled by the size. I understand that, obviously 100 -> 500 is a big jump, so it totally may not apply, but if anyone who is a current student can speak to that please let me know! Especially given the rural location

2) I'm lowkey worried that everyone is so locked in to studying that the social scene is not very good - I'm not a big partier, but also would like to have some fun/not spend my weekends studying the whole time - do I need to worry about this?

3) From what I've read, the perception of Williams is kind of a jock-y culture. While I'm not very into sports, I am fairly outdoorsy - I guess I'm just wondering if not being into sports would be a detriment to my experience?

4) As someone who is fairly awkward, is it difficult to make friends at Williams? Obviously it'll depend from individual to individual, but is there a lot of cliqueyness or weirdness?

I’d wait until I got on campus to order (or wait until I knew it’d arrive after I arrived), but I might need this item sooner rather than later.

I was admitted into Williams for the upcoming fall semester and now that I'm actively considering it (and leaning towards attending), I'm kind of stressing myself out over a slip in grades I had last semester. To cut to the chase, I went from straight As every other semester of school to this last year with 3 As, 3 Bs, and 1 C; my final GPA for that semester was a 4.3. My schedule was as tough as I could get it and I struggled a bit with that; my As were in AP Psych + Calc BC and dual enrollment civics, my Bs in AP Macro/Micro/Bio, and my C in AP Phys C E&M. I don't think those are unreasonably bad grades for those classes and especially given my circumstances (I do these classes virtually through my school because we don't offer them in person) but I am worried about the possibility of my acceptance being revoked because of the grade slip. I know it wasn't that big of a drop---from everything I've read, it sounds like I'll be alright because it wasn't in the grand scheme of things *that* drastic, but I'm still concerned. I never got a mid-year grades report submitted so that wasn't considered when I was admitted (my counselor sent them that today through Common App, and I've emailed admissions regarding the situation, still waiting to hear back from them on that). This semester's grades will be better, likely straight A's with maybe a B/C in physics.

Should I be worried? We're planning on visiting Williams this weekend and I don't want to make the 10 hour drive there only for it not to be an option. I know nobody here can likely answer this concretely but any perspectives on it would be nice while I wait for my answer to come in the email.

And, does anyone have any recommendations for things to do/see on campus or in Williamstown during a visit? :) Not entirely sure what else I can do other than walk the campus and try to get a feel for it all. Like I said, I live 10 hours away from Williams (in West Virginia) and so I want to make my trip count, both so as to have made it worthwhile and to soothe my anxiety about attending school somewhere so far from home.

Any advice would be appreciated greatly, sorry for the wall of text lol",1,422,34.54,1.41,94.66,29.84,30.14,16.35,91,73.7,59,17.54,10.43,9.24,0.47,0,0,0.71,7.11,13.27,4.74,1.42,16.35,9.95,4.98,8.06,2.37,18.25,6.16,1.9,1.66,0.47,0.95,0.24,15.64,1.18,14.45,3.08,1.66,2.13,3.08,0.47,3.32,0,4.74,2.37,1.66,1.9,0.47,1.18,0.95,0,0,0.47,6.64,4.74,0.95,0.47,0,0.47,1.9,1.9,0,0,0,0,0.71,0,0,0.71,6.16,0.24,0.24,5.69,0,0,0.24,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,1.42,0,0,0,0.24,0,0,6.87,9.72,0,2.37,6.87,0.24,0.47,0.24,4.27,4.27,3.32,1.18,1.42,1.18,0.24,0,0,16.35,2.84,3.79,0.47,0,3.55,5.69,0,,,

I will be going to the 12th grade in 6-7 months and I will apply early with the PG (Predicted Grade) which will be given depending on the results in the IB mock exams. I plan to apply to 8-10 universities. At the top of this list is Williams College. There are some reasons why I chose this place as my main target.

1- My sister is a graduate of Williams College Class of 2022 and I want to follow in her footsteps because I have identified her as a role model for myself.

2- They are very generous regarding Financial-Aid. This is a big plus since it is very difficult for a middle class family living in Turkey to pay 70-80 thousand dollars to a university every year.

3- I had the opportunity to visit the campus last summer. Both the campus and Williamstown were truly a wonderful environment. I think it will be worth spending 4 years of my university life.

4- Students are offered different opportunities that I have not seen in Turkish universities.

But what I want to learn today is the admission requirements. Of course, these are written on Williams' website, but I would like to learn more from accepted students.

I was recently admitted to Williams class of '28 as an international student. I didn't apply for any financial aid, and my middle-class parents—they have an annual income of around $60,000, but savings in the hundred thousands and family property inherited somewhere in the future—are concerned that the investment of $350,000 is not worth because its unlikely for me to get a well-paying job after Williams as a non-US citizen. I'll have to do a masters, which, if its in law or an MBA, will likely cost $200,000 more.

They're also concerned that its a massive blunder for me to cloister myself in rural Massachusetts, among American elites, when the global centre of power is shifting rapidly from West to East.

Williams does not have global brand, so its unlikely for me to come back to my home country in Asia and get a good job solely based on William's prestige.

My other options are UCL ($188,000), UCSD ($300,000), and Ashoka University ($60,000).

Obviously, if money wasn't an object, I would run to Williams; it's the best fit for a person like me and I see my thriving intellectually and socially over there.

So I’m apologizing in advance if I sound rude or ignorant. I’m looking to transfer to Williams from a Community College. Below are some questions I have, if anyone can answer them it would be greatly appreciated!

1. What tech companies actively recruit students from Williams College?

2. Are there tech based career fairs? 

3. What tech/latinx clubs are there?

4. Are there any Latinx in CS at Williams College? 

5. What are some things I should do in preparation when majoring in CS at Williams? 

6. Is there a platform that students at Williams college use to view rankings of current professors based on what previous students thought about their teaching? (Similar to rate my professor)

7. Do the CS students at Williams college help each other or purposely give each other bad advice to be at a more competitive edge? 

8. Do William’s College CS Alumni actually help current students in terms of referrals, internships, full-time jobs, and connections? (I have seen and heard that many students and alumni are consistently being hired from big tech firms. Although, I personally might not work at a big tech firm it does give me some reassurance)

Thank you for taking the time to read and writing a response to these questions I have.

I am a rising in senior in HS looking to apply to Williams ED in a few days. I am a gay guy and would like to have at least some options when it comes to community/dating/hookups at college. I know that just because of how small the school is there will definitely be limited options, but I was hoping there would be at least somewhat of a pool (even if it's shallow.) Also, I was curious given the athletic culture how the queer community is generally treated. My questions are:

1. Is there a decent sized population of mlm and other queer guys?
2. How common are gay couples/emphasis on hookups or relationships? 
3. general treatment of gay men specifically?

Thanks for all these answers btw this thread is so helpful when it comes to looking at colleges I appreciate y'all.

I'm a Korean high school student(Hankuk Academy of Foreign Studies) with a passion for Latin and Computer Science, and Williams has always been my dream school due to its intimate campus environment. Thanks to an educational opportunity from KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology), I'll be in Massachusetts, specifically around the Harvard and MIT area, from September 12 to 22.

Realizing that Williams College is just about 200km from Boston, I'm eager to seize this chance to visit the campus before I apply in the next couple of years. Given the constraints of my trip's itinerary, I'd need to have a contact at Williams, be it a faculty member or a student, who could possibly guide me or vouch for my visit. I believe such a visit would greatly benefit my understanding and appreciation of the college.

If anyone is available or knows someone who might be, I'd be truly grateful for any assistance or direction.

Also, wanted to know if anyone coming into Williams ever felt landlocked or constricted coming from the suburbs (near cities)? I visited campus for Previews dreaming about Williams as my top choice, but I felt that the campus was very flat and isolated, and it made me kind of sad. This is still something I'm trying to digest before committing, so I'd appreciate if anyone could share their experience getting used to Williams. Also, is it possible to visit bodies of water nearby (ie. rivers, lakes)?

1. do you think the career center is extremely effective at helping students prepare for interviews, write their medical school applications, etc.? like i've heard a lot about the support they give you but is it actually genuinely groundbreaking and extremely helpful?
2. in your opinion, do you think williams grade inflates, deflates, or neither? what are some common classes that are generally seen as ridiculously wayy too difficult? essentially, i kind of want to know how difficult it is to maintain straight As and A+s -- like what is the time commitment, basically? how many hours do you generally spend on homework? obviously this differs across major, level of class selection, and classes themselves (so would also be awesome if you could specify these in your answer!)
3. what does the social scene look like? how often do people party, are these parties enjoyable, etc. is it easy to make friends and are people generally down to like go out or like study sesh together etc.? what do people usually do for fun?
4. i've heard that williams' culture can be overly like white and preppy -- do you think this is true?
5. how competitive is the premed culture? do you think premed stuff gets at all cutthroat?
6. overall, why do you think premeds drop out? how many generally do? do more people drop out because they realize premed is too much work and it's not worth it, or because they realize they want to do something else, or because of really difficult classes or discouragement, or because they failed a premed requirement that they're not good at (like physics or smth)?
7. i've heard it's insanely easy to get research at williams -- very much as simple as talking to a prof after class -- but is there also good support for undergraduate students who want to conduct more high level research on their own with the help of a professor? like have students written their own papers and done their own research, the kind that gets published and wins awards yada yada
8. how well do people do with medical school applications? like how many people per year generally get into super top tier medical programs? do you know anyone who applied to and succeeded with applications to md-phd programs? (the dream fr)
9. how easy has it been for you to form meaningful relationships with professors and like actually talk to them one-on-one about academics, random stuff that doesn't really pertain to class, personal stuff, etc.?
10. are there competitive club applications?
11. random and maybe not so random cons of williams in your opinion? like what tiny things irk you? what big things irk you? especially what is the biggest annoyance of living in the middle of nowhere LOLL
12. pros of williams that you didn't realize would be amazing until you attended?

I was accepted to Williams College in the RD round 2 weeks ago. I haven't committed yet, as I still have a couple of questions that I was hoping I could get answered. To preface, I'm a political science (and possibly economics double major) major interested in the law and or consulting.

Thank you for all of your help!

&#x200B;

1. Is it true that there's grade deflation at Williams? Even with local or east coast graduate schools or employers knowing that grade deflation is common, would it negatively affect my placement at jobs or schools in other regions (such as the west coast, etc)? Are Williams' opportunities limited to the Boston/ Northeast area?
2. Are there student gyms available to work out? I could find a few student organizations that allow you to borrow equipment, but are there any local or college gyms that I could go to regularly?
3. What are the chances of receiving a single room vs a double, given that I select my preference as ""single"" on the housing form? I've seen a couple of posts about selecting Mission vs. Frosh Quad. Is there one that's better than the other, or one that you would personally recommend (for making friends, etc)?
4. How easy is it to double major OR change majors? I read that 40% of all undergraduate students double major at Williams, but how much flexibility do students *really* have? I got accepted for Political Science but I'm considering adding Economics and pursuing consulting after college.
5. One of the biggest drawbacks for me is that Williams doesn't accept any AP scores or College Credits. I've taken (and will be taking) a total of \~15 AP tests with passing scores, and also another 10 college classes that would satisfy 75% of community college requirements in California. I could skip 1 to 1.5 years of CC requirements, but weighing that against a 4-year Williams education is rough... Has anyone else been in a similar situation before?
6. The feeling and sense of a community are super important to me. How active are the Debating Team or the South Asian Students' Association? I come from an Asian-dominated county, city, and school. I'm open to all demographics and realize that Williams contains an entirely different cultural dynamic. How active are associations like SASA, and how big does their membership tend to be? Are they smaller close-knit groups, or are they wider groups with their own friend groups and cliques?
7. One of the biggest pros about Williams is its huge alumni network and successes in job/ graduate school placements. Can anyone describe their experiences with the '68 Center for Career Exploration? What does the process look like? Does it involve emailing former students at Williams? Is this the same as the EphLink mentoring website? Also, since a large percentage of Williams alumni take jobs in Boston, are there alumni that help connect you with opportunities in the west coast or southeastern United States?

Is that where I would send the letter?

(TL;DR: Edexcel student here, have always been above average as a student and got all 9s in IGCSEs, but flunked my AS-level exams and ended up getting BCC, although, I believe that my true strengths bloom freely with my ECAs. Should I apply ED to Williams, my dream college, or just go for a safer option?)

I am from a LDC in South Asia, and I have received an Edexcel education ever since middle school. All throughout high school, I have been a decent student, ranking in the top single-digit percentage always. The hard work paid off as I got all 9s on my IGCSEs (otherwise, I got a 4.0 GPA in all of my courses for my sophomore year). However, owing to following an improper mode of hybrid education towards to end of 2021 and the first quarter of this year, my AS-level education was severely hit and I ended up getting BCC on my 3 subjects. In retrospect, it isn't the end of the world, as I am retaking a few papers and hoping to bounce back, but the sadness (and I only say this because I haven't been mentally evaluated to be clinically depressed) I suffered through this year has harshly impacted by mental health and wellbeing - which in turn affected my SAT score too.

I retook the SAT on Oct 1, and am expecting a 1450+ hopefully. However, my strengths get fully expressed through my ECAs. I am a Duke of Edinburgh Alum, having completed all the journeys and having received all three certifications. I was also in charge of handling the marketing for 2 F&B giants in my country, and during my tenure, we reached 10s of millions of people across the internet. Being an adept growth hacker, I co-founded (and am serving as the chief editor) a news platform which quickly became the biggest bite-sized media agency in my country, and which reached people in the metric of 100s of millions across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn. The success of our bite-sized media agency saw one of our competitors partnering up with us to come under an umbrella company - one that I am a majority stakeholder of, and that has recently been valued at $1.0 million in our seed round (however, we are aiming for a $1.5 million valuation currently). Besides, I have been part of my school's football club and MUN club since middle school, having won trophies and medals for my football team, and serving as the director general at my school's MUN conference. Moreover, I have also appeared on a soap opera on our national TV network, and have acted in multiple OVCs, apart from voicing several commercials and characters over the year. I have also served as an English tutor to a few juniors, over the years.

Williams College has almost been like an exotic dream for me ever since I was in the 8th grade, and learned that my cousins graduated from Bates, Wellesley, and Pomona, while one was soon going to start at W&L.

I am a rising in senior in HS looking to apply in the fall as one of my top choices. I am a gay guy and would like to have at least some options when it comes to community/dating/hookups at college. I know that just because of how small the school is there will definitely be limited options, but I was hoping there would be at least somewhat of a pool (even if it's shallow.) Also, I was curious given the athletic culture how the queer community is generally treated (I come from a sports-focused all boys school so I am used to some mild toxicity.) So I guess my questions are:

1) Is there a decent sized population of mlm and other queer guys?

2) general treatment of gay men specifically?

Prefrosh here with the probably already asked question about AP Scores (sorry) - I’m looking at the guide online (https://registrar.williams.edu/course-registration/placement-information/ap-placement-guide/) and it seems like there aren’t many subjects that will earn you actual credit if you do well enough on the AP Exam. My question is  how stressed should I be on the exams that could possibly place me in a higher course or even earn me credit? I don’t know details for several of them based on the website alone, unfortunately, but how worth it is, say, pulling a 5 on AP Lit and getting the advanced placement? Also, if a subject (specifically any AP history course) offers no advanced placement, is there any practical reason for me to want to even pass the exam?

I've really liked Williams since the very beginning (one of my very top choices for a variety of reasons, and also my parents love Williams). I want to fully do my research though before I commit anywhere, so I'd appreciate if people here could answer some of my questions! Thanks so much, I'm so so happy 😊

1. What's the 'tutorial based' academics like? What does this mean exactly? How has your experience been with this teaching style? 

2. What's the friendship scene like? Stratified groups? Everyone socializes with each other, and a few really close friends? Parties? (I'm not a big party person but like to try things out and meet people and have fun) Also- I really don't plan on joining a frat/sorority in college. 

I'm pretty extroverted, but mostly in the sense that I like to spend quality time with my friends or really get to know people. 

I'm not a super outdoorsy person either, which does kind of worry me for my fit to Williams. I like walks and stuff but hiking consistently would be too much for me. 

3. Are you liking the social life at Williams? I heard Williamstown is a hit or miss with people. I talked to a girl from UMich who hated Williams's campus/town and loved UMich's campus/city lol. I'm leaning towards liking a small school more, but I'm not completely sure that I want to be super far away from a city. I like going to cafes and restaurants and museums and stuff. 

4. I'm really confused as to whether I want to pursue medicine (psychiatry) or law. Is Williams a good place to explore both and decide on one path in people's personal experiences? And then how are people doing with law/medicine internships, law/med school admissions, research, etc.? 

5. Does Williams have grade inflation or deflation? 

Lastly for now 6. What's the mental health of the student body like? 
I'm currently a dual enrolled high school senior at a local university with a ~60% acceptance rate. Freshmen here have disappointedly told me that this uni was their 'safety school,' even if I didn't ask at all and the uni is very good! (like... okay I don't know why I had to know that or what I can say😭). Anyways, the overall mental health/student satisfaction here is pretty bad (5+ suicides this year of underclassmen) and the school spirit is medium-low I think. I don't think I could deal with this kind of environment somewhere else for 4 years. How does this environment compare with Williams's?",1,448,29.51,4.19,87.85,75.77,11.49,17.41,92.86,68.53,56.92,13.84,9.38,8.48,0,0.45,0,0.22,4.46,12.05,5.13,2.68,13.17,9.82,8.48,8.26,1.56,16.74,5.58,3.57,3.79,2.23,0.45,1.12,18.08,0.45,17.63,4.24,1.56,2.01,4.02,1.79,5.13,0,7.14,5.36,1.79,3.13,2.01,1.12,0.22,0.22,0.22,0,10.27,4.46,0.89,0.45,0,0,1.56,4.91,0.22,0.67,0.45,0,0,0,0,0,6.7,1.56,0,4.91,0.22,0,2.46,1.79,0,0,1.34,0,0,0.45,0.22,0.45,0.67,0.45,0,0.45,0,0,0.22,0.67,9.6,6.92,0,1.12,5.58,0,0.22,0.22,2.01,2.9,6.92,0.67,0.45,0.22,0.22,0,0,23.44,5.36,2.68,2.9,1.56,5.8,5.13,1.34,,,

I also have the rigorous course work with AP classes etc, but I assume most applicants have that too.  I have a good amount of extracurriculars, and I actually have invested time on them.  

Williams is very appealing to me as the environment sounds great from what I have read, and the fact that the offer their partnership with Columbia to possibly get an engineering degree with the Williams sounds pretty useful later on.

It seems like literally no one is happy here. I know several people who are considering transferring because of how toxic the work culture here is and how damaging it is to the mental wellbeing of the students. Somehow this school costs over 70k a year yet the counseling center and office of accessibility are understaffed.

Additionally, the administration has treats us like actual children. Yes, it is great that with COVID they ensured we did not have an outbreak. However, they put unnecessary measures in place that literally no one supports. For example, there was rumors that someone got roofied a few weeks ago and the school decided that we could only swipe in to our own dorms. And this was at all times. Just a major inconvenience that did 0 to help the situation. And now campus security is shutting down parties in dorms when they never did before, killing the already non existent nightlife here.

And this is not even to consider the additional stress if you are not rich, white, cis, and able bodied.

&#x200B;

I'm a rising high school senior that is applying to colleges this fall. I've narrowed down my ED schools to Williams and Dartmouth and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding between the two schools. I would appreciate any insight that students had that would help me decide. For reference, I will most likely want to study Economics and do something with math, whether that be either doing a double major or getting a minor in math. I will also be cross-posting this to both r/WilliamsCollege and r/dartmouth to get as much input as possible from current students or alumni.

&#x200B;

In terms of the quality of education, I have heard good things about both schools, especially in regards to their econ departments as they are very popular at both colleges. I think the math department at Williams is quite a bit stronger than Dartmouth's, though. Moreover, both schools say they're ""undergraduate-focused"" but I think this is more true of Williams where classes are smaller than Dartmouth and fewer students are competing for research positions and stuff like that especially in a major as popular as econ. Some Wiliams students I have talked to said they even chose Williams over HYPSM because of this and said that Williams has the best quality of education in the world. Does Dartmouth compare? Also, Williams has the Oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.

&#x200B;

The Alumni network also matters to me a lot since I am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. I've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. However, Dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from Dartmouth than Williams. While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in. I don't really know which is better, but I would say maybe Dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but I would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each school.

&#x200B;

This is kinda unique to Dartmouth but I don't know whether the D-Plan is on net good or bad. I've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. Sophomore summer and ""Camp Dartmouth"" sound cool too. I've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. I've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.

&#x200B;

In terms of the campuses, I, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either Williams or Dartmouth. Architecture and the ""look"" of a school matter to me a lot though. I really like the rural vibes of both the schools. If anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.

&#x200B;

In terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. However, the people at Williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at Dartmouth, which I've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what I've picked up from the vlogs I've watched and things I've heard. Williams concerns me a bit because I have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. However, Dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.

&#x200B;

That brings me to greek life. From what I have heard, Dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. I have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. I don't really think I would enjoy frats and I'm even more concerned since if admitted I will be on lots of financial aid so I don't know if I'll be able to afford to join one if I wanted to down the road. I have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. I'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I know this is really stupid, but the ivy league pReStIGe is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about Williams but most people know about Dartmouth. I am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but I was wondering if the Ivy League branding that comes with Dartmouth really matters in the future?

I would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between Williams and Dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school.

I applied to Williams last year under RD and got rejected which was pretty fair to me but this year I have decided to bring some changes to my application. I understand that every application procedure is different and one cannot pin down what will get me in however it will be really helpful to me if I can get some feedback. So here are the changes I will bring:

1. will submit my SAT score
2. will submit my mid-year report
3. have done considerably more MUNs than last year
4. will submit a dance supplementary video
5. have been teaching this kid English for the past 3 weeks (intend to teach till Nov)
6. part of literature club and editorial club (have done some minor things but still pretty close to me)
7. working on a website
8. working on a research paper
9. (common app) Essay: I will bring some slight changes to the essay that I submitted last year
10. will be a certified yoga teacher so I guess that will come into play

&#x200B;

So far these are the changes that I will bring to my application. Will be a real help to me if you could provide your feedback on it.

I was wondering if it is easy for Williams undergrads to go into foreign policy (e.g. working in global affairs for the Government, working at a Think Tank, etc.) after they graduate. Are there students at Williams who have these aspirations, and how successful are they with their goals?

The reason I am asking is because Williams doesn’t have an international relations/global affairs major. However, in every other way besides major offerings, Williams is my dream school (I hope that makes sense). I was thinking the best supplement for international relations is a major in economics and a concentration in global studies. However, I want to know if I would have a solid shot at going into the foreign policy world with a degree from Williams or should I look elsewhere?

Williams College has become my dream school over the past few months and I was thinking of applying with ED. 

I'm an international IB student who didn't think of preparing for an American Uni until now, which means that I haven't thought of preparing for the SAT until now (I'm in Grade 11). When I took practice tests, my scores weren't very high to submit to the school (definitely not in the 25th percentile) and was delighted to hear that Williams went Test Optional for a few more years. 

But since it's not test blind, test scores are going to be considered for ones who put it in, and I'm torn between trying to prepare for the SAT while doing IB (which is already rigorous) or just taking my chances and focusing on my GPA. I did read somewhere that students who submit their scores had almost double the chance of getting in compared to those who don't have scores... which makes me a little nervous.  

Are there any (international) students who got accepted without submitting SAT/ACT scores in 2021? Any insight/comment/advice would be appreciated!

I am a HS senior applying to Williams this year. I am wondering how many of you submitted your academic paper instead of the Williams' supplement essays. (or if you have any friends who did it!) All the college essay blogs say it's just a bad idea to submit the academic paper, but I am not sure. 

The Williams admission website says it's ""entirely"" optional to turn in the supplemental essays, but I actually doubt that. But, unlike Amherst, Williams lacks explanations for option 4, which is submitting an academic paper...? Also. ""in the last year"" means within the past 12 months, right? 

I got a good grade from that essay and my teacher wrote down really good comments as well... so I am not sure if this choice is really against my chance!

Hello! I have a bit of an issue choosing which teachers to get to write my letters. My issue is that when I went to a live public school, I was extremely close to my teachers. They loved me and told me that in the future, they would always be willing to write a letter. I still have their numbers and we still talk often. However, that was at the beginning of junior year. Then I got sort of chronically ill and started online school. I don’t bond as much with teacher online since I don’t even really talk to the teacher (or even know what they look like). Most of our communications are grading and sometimes emails. I have two teachers online that I think would be willing to write a letter. One of them really does seem to like me and the other is nice but I’m definitely not sure if she’d consider me one of her favorite students... not one of her least favorites either! She likes me but we don’t talk enough. Williams only allows three teacher reccomenders. Should I choose two old ones that really love me and one more recent teacher that likes me? Or should I choose one teacher from before and two recent teachers? Will it look bad to have most of my recommendations from teachers who don’t teach me anymore or go to my same school?

I have written my common app essay a few weeks ago and I would love help. I am planning on applying to Williams College and I am very excited about the prospect. However, I'm very nervous about the essay because it is very personal and emotional along with not being written in a very conventional style. I actually wrote it at 5 am in the morning one night. I had tried to plan how to write it for weeks and then suddenly, it was dark outside, I couldn't sleep, and I just started writing. I started crying once I finished reading it. It's not good enough to make an average person cry but since I lived it, it was definitely personally tearjerking. I tried writing my sentences very differently than I usually do, and I find it makes it a tad more emotional. But I am completely biased and would love a critical opinion. I don't really have anyone to ask. English isn't my parent's first language. I don't have a ton of other family members.

Williams bills itself as a ""need blind"" school like many other highly selective US colleges. However, I heard from students at Columbia and Penn (other need blind selective colleges) that they and a lot of their classmates were advised to apply for aid **after** they received their acceptance letter. They claimed that these colleges were, in fact, not need blind in practice. A student who got in Penn ED waited until May to apply for financial aid, and a student at Columbia I know said that a lot of their class applied after their acceptance. All students mentioned were domestic, and I am a domestic applicant.

In fact, Ivy Coach wrote a [blog post about it](https://www.ivycoach.com/the-ivy-coach-blog/college-admissions/2-reasons-need-blind-admissions-farce/) where they called need blind admissions a ""farce,"" claiming that ""colleges are not need blind as they may suggest so freely to applicants and their parents. Now there are a couple schools that are straightforward — they’re open and honest about being need aware. But all of those colleges that claim to be need blind, they too are need aware. They’re just not as honest about it."" as well as ""If a college actually did this, that college would not be able to sustain itself. It would have to dip into its endowment. Tuition is vital to highly selective colleges. It’s why tuition fees are so high. Schools would never make this error. They take need into consideration, even though they say just the opposite.""

Williams students who receive aid, is there really a disadvantage to applying for aid with your application? If so, can a student who gets in Early Decision apply for aid after acceptance? Will this impact the award in every way?

At Williams, neuroscience is only offered as a concentration and cog-sci as a program. There were less than 20 neuroscience courses, 4 of which are independent studies, and around 5 cog-sci courses, 3 of which are independent studies. I'm worried I might run out of courses to take or won't have enough neuroscience-related research opportunities to pursue, which is concerning because I'm hoping to go to grad school after graduation.
