Just wanted to share some stuff here for undergrads who may feel confused, anxious, and upset at everything going on with your TAs and instructors.

Most importantly, **do not let OSU lie to you.** Ed Feser had a field day with different percentages and stats in his all-student email, but if you look at the actual dollar signs (which he conveniently excluded) you'll see the facts. Our current minimum salary is **$1,762** ***before taxes***. For comparison, the minimum wage in Corvallis equates to $2,272/month, and the Corvallis livable wage for a single adult with no dependents is $3,519.20/month (per [MIT](https://livingwage.mit.edu/metros/18700)). OSU's proposed 10% increase to this minimum, in this context, means NOTHING. I've heard many people taken aback by the fact that we are asking for a 45% raise to the minimum salary. This would make the minimum salary around $2550/month. **A 45% increase is still significantly below a livable wage.**

OSU is also trying to remove our contract's 2-year reopener. Two-year reopeners not only allow us to re-negotiate in times of unprecedented change (as we did during the pandemic) but allows us to teach new union members how to bargain properly. **Removing the contract reopener is an attempt to restrict the union's bargaining knowledge** by only allowing us to bargain every 4 years. This is longer than the length of time that a typical master's student will even be at OSU and only allows PhD students to bargain their contract *once* in their entire duration here. In doing this, our new/incoming union members will be inexperienced when it comes to bargaining, as they will have never *seen* a bargaining session before- OSU will take advantage of this, and use our inexperience with bargaining to pass whatever contracts they want.

These are just two things we are fighting for. For deeper insight I encourage you to check out the union's [website ](https://www.cge6069.org/)and follow the union on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/cge6069/). **OSU has made it clear that their goal is to spread misinformation, fear-monger, and weaponize undergraduates against us with misleading data and blatant lies.** Because of this, I personally recommend receiving all strike-related updates directly from the graduate union at the mentioned links.

Additionally, **you are NOT required to use the Canvas form to report your TAs for striking.** This is OSU's way of using YOU to do THEIR job. It's their job to determine who is striking, NOT YOURS. Using the Canvas form is considered actively crossing our picket line, as is covering our shifts/classes as an undergraduate employee. **Any time you help OSU, you are actively hurting us.**

**If you are interested in supporting your TAs during strike, here is a list of some things you can do:**

**-** Sign the [Undergraduate Support Letter](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/letter-of-support-for-coalition-of-graduate-employee-strike?source=direct_link&)

\- Refuse to report absent TAs via the Canvas link

\- Refrain from purchasing food, drinks, and other goods from OSU dining halls and cafes (if you have the means to do so)

\- Refuse to take on the responsibilities of striking grad students (primarily for undergraduate employees)- reminder that **covering for a striking TA is actively crossing the picket line**

\- Spread the word! Send your friends the Support Letter, share the Instagram page, make your voices heard!

\- **Join us on the picket line during your free time!** We meet at 10am daily and picket at the MU until 4pm.

\- There is also a [Faculty Support Letter](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/an-open-letter-from-the-faculty-at-oregon-state-university?source=direct_link&) if you know of faculty who want to pledge support to striking grad workers.

\- Share the [Strike Fund](https://account.venmo.com/u/CGE-OSU?catchAll=u&catchAll=CGE-OSU) and donate if you have the means to do so! Striking grads are not getting paid during this time; many of us need to afford rent, bills, groceries, child care, etc. Any donation is MUCH appreciated!

**TL,DR: OSU is actively spreading misinformation and trying to get YOU to do THEIR work. Their contract proposal will lock graduate workers into a lengthy and unfair contract that forces us into poverty and submission. WE WILL NOT STAND FOR THAT and YOU shouldn't either! Spread the word, stay informed, and stand in SOLIDARITY with your TAs!**

So here it goes.

I sincerely apologize for how disorganized this subreddit has become. To put it bluntly, I have no clue who all is moderating this subreddit other than myself currently. I thought there were others, but the two mods I knew both left their mod positions and told me to figure out what to do. I‚Äôm really sorry about the state of some things on this subreddit recently. I have been doing my best to respond to any mod queue items I see, both to ensure rules are being followed but also to try to make sure that the subreddit is not banned for being unmoderated. However, I‚Äôm becoming overwhelmed with it. Additionally, I currently live and work on the other side of the planet and don‚Äôt think it makes any sense for me to be a mod here any longer. I am going to try to find out who else is a mod currently, as I don‚Äôt think everyone who is assigned as a mod actually manages this subreddit currently. 

Over the next couple weeks I will look into that, then sometime during winter break I will make a post about how to apply to be a mod. So I just ask for your patience until then.

As for the graduate student strike, I can assure that posts regarding the strike are not being removed by myself unless there are good reasons for it (i.e. if they break a subreddit rule). In fact, I am a previous PhD candidate at OSU and would have been joining in the strike as well if I were still a student there. However, based on the mod reports, it appears the Automod has been running rampant lately and removing posts, so I apologize for that. I will do my best to catch those in the meantime now that I know it is happening. 

And finally, thanks for being such a wonderful community (well, most of you are at least)! For the grad students out there, I wish you all the bust of luck on the strike and for all the students I hope your finals go well!",1,389,32.3,13.49,90.82,64.8,21.61,15.68,91.77,78.66,65.55,16.2,10.28,7.97,0,1.03,0,0.51,5.91,15.42,7.2,0.26,14.91,10.8,9.25,7.2,1.29,21.08,3.34,3.08,4.37,0.51,1.8,2.06,15.94,1.54,13.88,3.6,2.06,1.54,2.06,0.77,3.86,0,3.34,3.08,0.26,1.03,0.77,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,11.05,4.63,1.54,1.8,0,0,2.06,6.43,0,0,0,0,2.06,0.26,0,1.8,2.57,0,0,2.57,0,0,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.26,0.51,0.26,0,0,0,0,0.26,1.29,5.66,8.48,1.54,1.29,5.14,1.29,0,0.26,5.14,3.08,6.94,3.34,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,12.6,4.63,4.37,0,0.51,1.03,2.06,0

Hi Everyone,

I have been working for some time now on this website [ratemycourses.io](https://ratemycourses.io/oregon-state) and I am really excited to share it with you.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking. Also, since some courses depend on the professor, you can filter the reviews by professors and it will show you the average ratings for each professor.
Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.  (to leave a review, just search your course and you can submit a review at the bottom of the page)


Also, please dm me if you have an idea on how I can let more students know about this. And if anyone is interested in writing an article about this dm me!

They terminated my employment without warning or coaching, and left me without any time to find a new job. On top of that, they fired the Maintenance lead several days prior, so if y‚Äôall wandering why they are horrible at maintenance requests, it‚Äôs probably due to high turn over rate!

Especially don't leave a bag visible, even if it just has some notebooks or gym clothes in it. In that case, the backpack that gets stolen will cost less than replacing your smashed window! 

Every time you leave your car, think ‚Äî if everything in here was stolen right now, how would I feel? You should be comfortable leaving your car unlocked. Don't do that though, I've seen people cruise around pulling on car doors to see if they can steal a stereo...but that's the mindset you should have about valuables in your car.

He saw me on my bike talking to the cops when he got arrested. Today I find my bike completely vandalized. The cable lock for my wheels was cut and the wheels were stolen. seat slashed. cables cut. phone mount smashed. paint gouged. The other bikes on the rack were fine, it was targeted. I made a report. Even though It was outside a major residence hall there were no cameras.  It's insane how brazen the tweakers are here, I've had them smash into my friend's car just a block off campus during a game. I'm tired of seeing vagrants scouting the bike racks on campus and seeing mountains of bikes next to trash nests down by the dog park, both of which tell me that the issue is not being addressed and I am far from alone. I am sympathetic to the struggles of homelessness and addiction to what most people would consider a radical degree but I am not sympathetic to people who prey on people. I've had people in my life deal with homelessness and addiction and by their account they hated dealing with the tweakers more than I do.

I know the real fix is a societal solution at a larger scale but at the least, I'd love some added security; a bike room or a locker would be great but that's not available in my hall or most halls.

I just published a [Chrome Web Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/osu-rate-my-professor-ext/hgfogfefocfabnfjmjijfcjogeghmocn) that aims to ease your class browsing experience by directly displaying Rate My Professors reviews on OSU's class registration page. If you already use the Rate My Professors website when registering for classes, this extension will save you a lot of time.

It's simple to use! Here is a demonstration:

[Demo](https://reddit.com/link/15ihg3c/video/ivauljaes6gb1/player)

I am actively updating this extension, so if you have any suggestions, please let me know in the reply section! If you find this helpful, please consider supporting me by leaving a review.

Also, here is a link to the [source code](https://github.com/sebat2004/osu-rmp-extension) for anyone interested.

Edit: Rate My Professor reviews aren't always accurate, so take them with a grain of salt. I've found that positive reviews are often the most reliable. If you see a professor with good reviews, they're likely a good or excellent professor. The reliability falls off the lower the review because sometimes students let the grade they got in a class influence their opinion of a prof.",1,185,65.37,62.49,87,71.16,15.42,23.78,90.27,62.16,47.57,14.59,10.81,5.41,0,3.24,0,2.16,3.78,17.84,10.27,1.08,9.19,4.86,5.41,5.41,0.54,12.43,4.32,4.86,1.62,0,1.08,0.54,16.76,0,16.76,6.49,3.24,0,6.49,0,3.24,0,3.24,3.24,0,1.62,1.62,0,0,0,0,0,13.51,3.78,1.62,1.08,0,0,1.62,9.73,0,0,0,0,2.7,0,0,2.7,13.51,0,0,12.97,0,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,0,0,0,1.08,0,0,0,0,0,0.54,7.03,8.65,0.54,1.08,5.41,1.08,0,0,2.7,2.7,3.24,0.54,0.54,0.54,0,0,0,20.54,4.32,3.78,0,2.16,2.7,7.57,0

**We need your help tomorrow! There will be an undergraduate solidarity picket tomorrow 11/21 from 10 am - 4 pm in front of the Kerr admin building - please come join us for a while! Any amount of time you can join us helps tremendously!**

  
We have another bargaining session with OSU on Friday and it is really important that we show them that the students at OSU are NOT ok with how administration has been handling negotiations and bargaining sessions. If you can't make it out tomorrow and would still like to show your support, please consider signing this letter of solidarity if you have't done so already: [https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/letter-of-support-for-coalition-of-graduate-employee-strike?source=direct\_link&](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/letter-of-support-for-coalition-of-graduate-employee-strike?source=direct_link&)

The GD program only allows 40 people in per cohort which makes it competitive. Despite how difficult it may be to get in, the program is extremely understaffed and the professors that do teach are heavily under qualified. Most have little to no professional graphic design experience in the field (1 professor only having an Etsy page for therapy based graphics as their only experience). 

Along with that you will also have a single academic advisor who will actively register you into the wrong classes and will provide you with little to no help on your route to graduate. I have gone to student advocacy multiple times to report this academic advisor but to no help as he has quite a veteran status within OSU. He also initially lied to me about the program promising future animation classes later in the junior-senior year of program, which was not true (I was transferring with an associates in animation, at the time) and pushed the major onto me, for what I assume is my out-of-state tuition. 

So why am I writing this? Mostly, I‚Äôm upset that I spent the last 4 years paying to learn and walking out learning nothing. It‚Äôs also worth to note that your credits for Graphic Design will not transfer to any school outside of OSU as it is a cohort, linear 4 year program. So once you‚Äôre in, there‚Äôs no going out unless you wish to fully restart at another university. This stopped me from moving back home (all of the GD classes must be attended in person) and prevented me from transferring universities.

I‚Äôve always been frustrated with OSU and with the graphic design program. But now that I‚Äôm out and have started my first job in the field I‚Äôm truly starting to realize how little this university and program taught me.

Several of my colleagues and I have written an open letter, which we intend to send to Oregon's congressional delegation. If you want to sign it, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/jeiLHcGVQD4brsPY8).

([Link to letter in Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dc_LmI_VneR4g-vTE5HOGrNRcBdV1RjGg5bipU-S0Yk/edit))

&#x200B;

*To: Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley; Representatives Suzanne Bonamici, Cliff Bentz, Earl Blumenauer, Peter DeFazio, and Kurt Schrader.*

*Dear Members of Oregon's Congressional Delegation:*

*Please ask your colleagues in Congress to stop introducing and voting for bills that:*

1. *Will increase computer and internet-based surveillance in the United States.*
2. *Undermine encryption, the bedrock of privacy and autonomy in our era.*

*The most recent example of such a bill is the EARN IT Act, which is currently before the Senate Judiciary Committee and other committees in the House. We urge you to vigorously stand against this bill.*

*It is our view that bills which enlarge the surveillance state of America's digital landscape or strip individuals of the tools to protect themselves in this landscape are ill conceived. EARN IT is one such bill. Among other concerns, these types of bills:*

* *Are impossible to implement or enforce, from a technical perspective.*
* *Criminalize ordinary and law abiding behavior, or sets the groundwork to do so.*
* *Violate the spirit motivating, and letter of, various Constitutional tenets that safeguard cherished and inviolable civil liberties.*

*We, the undersigned, are computer scientists. We can attest to the laborious and ultimately futile effort of curtailing encryption. Regardless of the merits (or lack thereof) of the public policy rationale for undermining encryption, the one charged with carrying out any mandate to enact anti-encryption legislation is charged with the job of Sisyphus on a digital hill. The task of implementing law or software to circumvent encryption will always end in vain in the long run, but the damage that will be done with every failed attempt to succeed will be very real.*

*Surveillance and anti-encryption pushes are often proposed under the auspices of real or imagined threat. In the particular case of EARN IT, the articulated threat comes from perpetrators of online child pornography. An enacted EARN IT Act, if not de-facto banning encryption, will create a chilling effect on the use of encryption. The ironic result will be a decrease of children‚Äôs online safety by making it more difficult to safeguard their data, along with everyone else's data, from unwanted attackers and snoopers. Anti-encryption laws serve only to make vulnerable the law abiding and embolden the predatory.*

*We affirm that technology which protects or empowers the many must never be stripped away from a free people because of the abusive actions of a few, no matter how abhorrent or heinous the abuse of that technology may be. Civil liberties of the digital world may not yet be enumerated in our nation's highest laws in plain text, nor fully vitalized by the nation's courts from the penumbras of well established offline legal doctrine. Yet these rights and liberties of the digital world are very much extant and inalienable, regardless of their recognition by the congress, the executive, the judiciary, or the tech titans of the day. Mass surveillance and anti-encryption movements desecrate these liberties.*

*We, the undersigned, are digital natives. We have lived with technology, developed it, and have an intimate understanding of its uses; we have seen technology bring out the best of humanity, and the worst. The world that will result from the enactment of bills like EARN IT is not the world we wish to live in, now nor ever. We believe that passing this bill, and others like it, will not only undermine individual freedom, but will also have disastrous collective consequences. Attacks on encryption, and an expansion of mass surveillance, are moves one would expect to find in an outpost of tyranny, not in a mature democratic republic, and certainly not in the United States of America.*

*We thank you for your longstanding interest in these issues. Please, stop this bill and others like it at all costs.*

*Sincerely,*

*\[Long list of signatures, including 40+ faculty and graduate students in computer science at nine of Oregon's universities.\]*

Here's an extremely long recap of my experience:

1. I attended the Colorado-Wazzu game Friday night, then drove back to Spokane right after the game. I had an early flight with a stopover in Seattle that was supposed to get me to Portland at 9am, so I was hoping to be in Corvallis by 11-11:30am after picking up the rental car and driving down from PDX. I had it all mapped out: I'd grab an early lunch at Local Boyz, grab a drink or four at Bombs Away, and then walk over to a tailgate that /u/Big_Box_O_Shine had invited me to attend. The Beavs would win, then I'd celebrate at Clod's, Peacock, or wherever else the night took me. But then...

2. My flight to Seattle took off on time and arrived as schedule. However, as we landed through fairly heavy fog, I actually thought to myself, ""Hmm, I wonder how they decide *how much* fog is too much to land through."" As it turns out, the answer was the thickness of the fog about 2 minutes after we landed. The Seattle airport apparently issued a ground stop due to the fog, so no flights were taking off or landing and I was stranded until the fog cleared. Once it did finally clear a couple of hours later, we had to wait for the actual aircraft to arrive from Portland so that we could take it right back to PDX. By the time all that occurred, my flight took off from Seattle over 4 hours after its scheduled departure time.

3. I finally landed in Portland around 1:30pm and was able to quickly get my rental car and make it to Corvallis around 3:30pm. I parked and headed immediately to the previously mentioned tailgate, where /u/Big_Box_O_Shine and his crew were incredibly welcoming, friendly, and fun. In order to make up for lost time, we (I, mostly) took shots -- oh, so many shots -- and crammed about 3-4 hours worth of drinking into 30 minutes while getting acquainted, talking football travels, and discussing the upcoming game. Spirits were high.

4. We walked over to the stadium and made it in time for kickoff, but I obviously missed all the pregame band festivities outside the stadium and only caught the tail end of the pregame on-field performance, which was a bummer.

5. Despite the cold and the rain, the atmosphere in the stadium was pretty damn electric IMO. Third downs were loud -- not just the chainsaw sound being piped in, but the crowd obviously disrupting Penix and the Washington offense at times. The student section was active all night, with their hard hats continuously bobbing up and down. I mean, the atmosphere was strong enough that it made a Southern boy forget that he was freezing cold and soaking wet, and instead focus on the fun of a Top-10 Pac-12 After Dark matchup in a great environment. That's a pretty high bar to clear. I also moved around a fair amount to experience the stadium from different spots, and every Beaver fan I met was friendly and enthusiastic. Fantastic fan base.

6. As for the stadium itself, obviously I have no previous experience to go on. I don't know if I would've preferred the nostalgia of its previous form by comparison, but seeing it for the first time as-is, I found it largely well-designed, attractive, and modern. Having walked around the entirety of the stadium (inside and out), I imagine recruits would find it impressive, as well. The size seemed perfectly suited for Corvallis and OSU -- large enough to create a fun, loud environment that exuded a big-time college football vibe, but not overbuilt for the size of the school and town.

7. The only area where I think the stadium comes up a bit short is bathroom availability. Considering the width of the concourses and placement of the stairwell/escalators, it seems like they probably could've budgeted a bit more space for restrooms, but I'm not an architect, so what do I know? Either way, it was still a relatively minor inconvenience in a stadium I still thought was fantastic.

8. As an unabashed lover of stadium singalongs and silly CFB things in general, I loved when ""Party in the USA"" was played over the PA. It was a random bit of fun in an otherwise intense game, with even the Husky fans around me getting into it. Then as soon as it was over, it was back to yelling and screaming when the Huskies had the ball. Loved it.

9. I really thought the Beavs had it. That last drive was going perfectly. Slowly matriculating the ball down the field, burning off clock with each first down. I had this vision in my head of 3 more first downs and a walk-off FG to win it. But then that 2nd & 12 throw down the sideline baffled me. At a point when OSU was moving the ball in small chunks pretty consistently, there was plenty of time left, and all 4 downs were gonna be used no matter what, I didn't understand the reasoning behind taking a low-percentage shot downfield. It basically took an extra down away and put all the pressure on getting 6+ each of the next two downs. It also made me sick to my stomach to look back and realize that a safety on an airmailed punt snap in a downpour was the difference in a game where Oregon State largely outplayed Washington. Tough loss.

10. After the game, I headed back to the same tailgate and commiserated over beers. I can't say enough about those fine folks. Not only were they extraordinarily welcoming and incredibly fun to hang out with, but their passion for the sport and for the Beavs was readily apparent. They are so passionate about their alma mater and have celebrated that passion for so long that it's impossible not to want to root alongside them.

11. When we got to talking about what's next due to conference realignment and all the issues it presents, it made my heart sink for both Oregon State and Wazzu. I changed plans and made this trip because I wanted to see both schools in person before the Pac-12 crumbles. Having now done so, it seems even more unfair and stupid and rage-inducing than it did from afar. Look, I've been to games between teams from the Sun Belt, MAC, AAC, etc. While I have a deep respect for those schools, appreciate the role they play in CFB, and love spending my fall weeknights watching their games on TV, it's just a different tier of football. I've also visited the vast majority of the Power 5 schools, so I have a massive baseline for comparison. There's no doubt -- **ZERO, ABSOLUTELY NONE** -- that Oregon State and Washington State belong in the upper tier. It sucks that schools like UCLA that already have the location, resources, historic stadiums, etc. and still can't cultivate a passionate fanbase get an express pass to the mega-money while y'all get screwed. There's no other way to say it; it just sucks.

12. After helping pack up the tailgate, I headed back to my car around 10pm. Once I got there, I realized my key fob had disappeared and spent the next 20 minutes in panic mode. I hustled back to the tailgate spot and fortunately the key was right at the edge of the parking spot where the equipment truck had been. It must have fallen out of my jacket pocket while loading stuff up. Disaster averted.

13. However, due to that delay, it was closer to 11pm by the time I got back to my car. I was cold and soaking wet, and due to the late planning of this trip, I couldn't find a place to stay in Corvallis and had to book in Salem instead. I still drove by the Peacock and Clod's to try to talk myself into powering through it, but the lines in front of each were horrendously long at that point, so I settled for a heated car and a stop at Riva's for a late-night bite before heading to the hotel. It was immaculate after a long day, and I can only imagine how much better it would've been if I were considerably drunker. So big thanks to those who commented on the previous post for pointing me in that direction.

14. On Sunday, I slept in a bit, took my time getting ready, and then headed back to Corvallis, arriving a little before noon. Extremely bummed that I missed my chance at Local Boyz because it's closed on Sundays, I grabbed lunch at a nearly empty Bombs Away. I then headed downtown and spent my afternoon slowly sipping beers at Sky High, Treebeerds, and Block 15. Continuing the theme, I again met great folks at each of those places and felt incredibly welcome in Corvallis.

15. After cutting myself off, walking around downtown & along the river, and grabbing some coffee (a rarity for me), I drove back to Portland for my evening flight. Since I had a redeye with a stopover in Salt Lake City, I decided I should probably go ahead and grab supper in Portland before flying out. I stopped by Botto's BBQ, which was recommended by the folks at Texas Monthly, and it did not disappoint. The brisket wasn't quite to the level of Matt's in Portland or some of the top places in Central Texas, but the ribs were spectacular and the two sides I had -- Hatch chili mac & cheese and Brunswick stew -- were also fantastic.

Overall, I had a fantastic time in Corvallis. It was unfortunate that a delayed flight and a slippery key fob limited my ability to maximize my time in town, but between my ill-fated trip for the Montana State game and the game experience of this one, it's almost like I've taken two half-trips that equal a whole. With that said, I think Corvallis is a great college town, so I would still like to come back at some point for a full weekend trip -- get in by lunchtime on Friday, have plenty of time to explore, take in the the Friday nightlife, tailgate all day, see some of the pregame festivities I missed, and eat my way around town (I can't believe I'm 0-2 on Local Boyz) before heading home. Meeting incredible folks like /u/Big_Box_O_Shine only solidified that desire, so huge thanks to him and his crew for being such great hosts.

Anyway, sorry for the obnoxiously long post. Again, my sincere thanks to all of y'all for the tips and the hospitality I was shown.

One last thing: I've been traveling all around the country for games since 2018, but this season I finally caved to my friends' encouragement and have begun sharing some of my travels publicly. So if you'd like to see pics, videos, etc., I've posted a long ""story highlight"" to my Instagram page (@cfbtravelguy), plus will be posting several Reels from the game when I've got some time to do some editing. I also post some videos on TikTok (@cfb.travel.guy) and plan to put together lengthier trip reviews -- basically this post, but in video form with some additional commentary and clips from my trip -- on YouTube (@cfbtravelguy) after the season when I've got some spare time. 

Feel free to check that stuff out, and if you have questions about other places I've been, don't hesitate to ask.

Okay I'm hoping to get this pinned, trending or something so I can come to the Department of Transportation at OSU with it.

The mismanagement of C parking is getting atrocious. I'm sure if you're in reser driving around for your 8-11 am classes you'll see everyone driving in circles and following people to there cars. This is not fair, and has resulted in people being late for classes or giving up and not attending (including myself)

Reser/ C parking is being oversold on top of giving spots to visitors for events and construction workers. We paid $100+ for our passes to not even be able to get a spot sometimes. I'm sure we signed something when we bought the pass of ""you aren't guaranteed a spot,"" but this shouldn't be a near everyday occurance. When plane tickets are oversold, alternatives are offered. We aren't even told when spots are roped off and are unavailable until we show up.

From 11/1-11/10 the back row of the side of reser along western and 26th is roped off. This is about 20 spots, not including the numerous spots in the line connecting the two lots that are blocked off due to poor pavement. 

This is just getting quite frustrating. As a student who has already paid tens of thousands of dollars to OSU on top of the parking pass, I feel it is ridiculous that I can't even attend classes sometimes because there isn't enough available parking due to construction that I at least know I didn't consent to. Our tuition is being used to build reser, which I didn't agree to, especially knowing I wouldn't be able to park easily most days.

Some of you might see me around this subreddit constantly plugging, but I run a LARP (chapter of Amtgard if you're interested in looking it up) that still meets up throughout the summer in Corvallis.  If you are interested, we're hosting a big ol' throwdown where people are dressing up as skeletons and bringing foam swords to bap each other with.  We're a bunch of nerds, we're quite friendly, and it's completely free save for the price of gas to get there. Just show up at Avery Park (1200 SW Avery Park Drive) at noon on Saturday, July 1st with your smiling faces, some clothes you're comfortable exercising in, and a bunch of water and we will take care of the rest. (skeleton costume optional but recommended).

I'm available to DM if this sounds like your jam, and if you're interested in joining our merry band of nerds on a weekly basis, you can find our discord here: [https://discord.gg/mb3gN8Sq](https://discord.gg/mb3gN8Sq).  We meet every Saturday at noon by the Bones at Avery Park.

The water temperature is currently 52 F. Just watch and see how many people drown in rivers this weekend because they jumped in. How can you swim safely this spring?

[A study on the physiology of cold water immersion (cold = 50-60 F)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7730683/)

>The lungs contract in the first few seconds followed by uncontrollable hyperventilating and loss of breathing control [79]. The heart rate, and blood pressure and cardiac output increase with simultaneous peripheral vasoconstriction [4,80]. The dynamic response is initiated by peripheral cold receptors, peaking approximately 30 seconds after exposure and adapting over about two minutes [81]. The initial shock and loss of breathing control is where the swimmer is at greatest risk of drowning and death is it requires very little aspirated water to initiate the drowning process [82]. Experienced winter swimmers become more resistant to the cold shock reaction through conditioning and progressive adaptation of the body to the cold regularly and with increasing frequency and gradual lowering of temperatures [83]. It is crucial to adapt and acclimatize to the initial shock response as it is particularly hazardous, accounting for the majority of cold water immersion deaths [75].",1,234,94.27,45.12,30.98,1.09,19.5,30.77,82.48,55.98,42.31,4.27,1.28,0,0,0.85,0,0.43,2.99,12.39,8.12,5.98,14.53,3.85,3.85,6.41,0,7.26,8.55,6.41,1.28,0,0,1.28,7.26,0,7.26,0.85,4.7,0.43,0.43,0,1.28,0,4.27,0.43,3.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.99,1.71,0.43,0,0,0,1.28,1.28,0,0,0,0,1.28,0,0,1.28,1.71,0.43,0,1.28,0.43,0,5.56,0.43,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.14,0.85,0,0,0,0,0,0,2.56,0,1.28,10.26,0.43,2.14,4.7,0.85,0,2.99,6.84,0.85,5.13,0,0.43,0.43,0,0,0,16.67,4.7,2.14,0.43,0,0,9.4,0

# EMAIL FROM OREGON STATE

11 March 2020

Oregon State University is committed to state, national and global efforts to reduce the risk and spread of COVID-19, while appropriately continuing the essential activities of teaching, research, OSU Extension and engagement. While at this time, the public health risk in Oregon from the coronavirus is lower than it is in other states, we became aware today of a presumptive COVID-19 case in Deschutes County and testing for a possible case in Benton County is underway.

**Effective Saturday, March 14, OSU will move to a higher level of response that continues the essential operations of the university, but seeks to reduce the frequency of interactions among students, faculty, staff and visitors throughout all university campuses, centers, facilities and operations. Our focus is on continued university operations and social distancing.**

In taking these steps, we remain mindful and informed by the public health guidance of our local county health departments, the Oregon Health Authority and the CDC.

**Effective March 14, 2020:**

¬ß  Campuses and OSU facilities and operations statewide will remain open.

¬ß  Winter term finals week exams and activities will be delivered remotely where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

¬ß  University academic and remote meeting tools, including Canvas and Zoom, will be used to minimize in-person meetings.

¬ß  All non-essential OSU-sponsored travel will be suspended.

¬ß  All OSU employees will be encouraged to work remotely where work responsibilities and duties allow.

¬ß  All OSU students, faculty and staff are encouraged to avoid personal travel over spring break. Students should instead consider remaining at our campuses in Corvallis and Bend.

We are taking these immediate steps while OSU employees and students prepare to take expanded public health measures at the start of spring term.

**Effective March 30, 2020:**

¬ß  All of the above actions are maintained.

¬ß  All spring term courses, labs and exams will be delivered remotely, where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

¬ß  Until at least April 30, no non-essential OSU-sponsored events of more than 50 attendees will be permitted. All events with fewer than 50 attendees will be held with maximum social distancing.

**The status of these measures will be evaluated every two weeks.**

We recognize such steps will prompt many questions and cause disruption. We ask for everyone to accommodate these changes, engage in and support appropriate support personal health measures, support as able other OSU community members, and frequently check the university‚Äôs [COVID-19 website](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus) for updated information.

Given that OSU plans that all university operations will remain in effect, we anticipate the continued employment and benefits for all employees. During this time, the university will seek to continue the employment of its student workers.

The following provides additional information regarding important aspects of OSU‚Äôs COVID-19 response.

**SOCIAL DISTANCING:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html) as avoiding crowds and mass public gatherings, and when possible, maintaining a distance of approximately six feet from others. Social distancing also means staying at home when ill, avoiding contact with people who have symptoms of illness, and not shaking hands.

**FINAL EXAMS:** Because OSU will administer final exams using a social distancing model, for those exams that must be held in-person, the university will seek to relocate final exams to locations where room capacity is three times the number of people registered to take that test. Faculty will notify students of changes in finals week logistics.

**REMOTE TEACHING:** Remote teaching delivery is when a faculty member facilitates the delivery of their in-person course instruction from a different location by using tools such as Canvas and Zoom. With the¬†suspension of face-to-face meetings and the requirement for remote teaching, OSU will provide key resources available to faculty, staff and students. These include the following web pages: [Keep Teaching](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-teaching), [Keep Learning](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-learning) and [Keep Working](https://uit.oregonstate.edu/keep-working). If you have any questions or require any technology assistance, please [contact the Service Desk](http://is.oregonstate.edu/help). Additionally, there will be online and telephone resources readily available to help students navigate all aspects of online delivery, including Zoom.

Additional information on remote teaching is available for all students, faculty and staff within the university‚Äôs COVID-19 web page [‚ÄúHot Topics‚Äù under remote teaching.](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus/remote-teaching-learning-and-working-faq)

**SPRING BREAK:** We ask that OSU students, faculty and staff carefully evaluate Spring Break travel plans. If you are a student, please consider staying on campus or simply going home instead of traveling elsewhere during the break. OSU‚Äôs residence halls will remain open during spring break. If you are an employee, please consider remaining within your home community. We realize this may disrupt your plans, but broader travel within the U.S. and abroad brings additional risk of exposure to COVID-19, which includes the possibility of self-isolation upon return.

**EVENTS:** OSU‚Äôs future requirements regarding events is based upon the university‚Äôs interest in reducing the opportunity for COVID-19 to spread among people who gather in large public settings.

OSU recognizes that other universities, colleges, K-12 school districts, the state of Oregon and employers may at some time institute other requirements regarding the number of people in attendance at event. We also recognize that CDC guidance on crowd sizes may be different. In OSU‚Äôs case, university leaders believe that the facilities throughout the university can best accommodate our social distancing goals at a maximum of 50 people within OSU-sponsored events.

Information about the university‚Äôs COVID-19 response involving OSU Athletics events will be updated on Thursday, March 12.

Because COVID-19 remains a rapidly developing situation, it is important to check OSU‚Äôs page regularly, as well as advisories and warnings from the [U.S. Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) prior to finalizing personal travel plans and undertaking travel.

Please utilize OSU‚Äôs dedicated non-emergency COVID-19 information line, which is available to assist faculty, staff and students with questions at 541-737-7211. You can also seek information through the questions and non-emergency contact form on the [COVID-19 website](https://oregonstate.edu/COVID-19). In the case of a medical emergency, call 911 or a nearby emergency medical facility.

The best preventive measures for COVID-19 and any communicable disease continue to be the practices you undertake as part of your daily routine, especially during flu season:

¬ß  Engage in social distancing;

¬ß  Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with warm soapy water or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol;

¬ß  Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with another person‚Äôs saliva, whether in your own living or social environments;

¬ß  Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue; then discard the tissue;

¬ß  Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to support a healthy immune system;

¬ß  If you are not well, remain at home and contact your primary care physician, Student Health Services or a local emergency medical care provider.

During this time of public health concern and changes in OSU‚Äôs operations, please remain mindful and supportive of members of the OSU community who may be more directly affected by the coronavirus situation. Also, it is important that we remain a united community. If you witness any acts of bias or discrimination related to COVID-19, please report them to the [OSU Bias Incident Response](https://diversity.oregonstate.edu/bias-incident-response) team.

Thank you for your understanding and your continued work to keep the OSU community safe and healthy.

Sincerely,

Edward Feser

Provost and Executive Vice President

## Most OSU Corvallis campus fall instruction to be offered remotely and online

Dear OSU faculty and staff,

We write to announce important decisions regarding instruction for the fall term.

Based on careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU‚Äôs Corvallis campus will deliver most courses remotely in the fall, making it possible for students to live and study from home if that is the best option for them. This approach will limit the density of activity on-campus and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19 among students and employees.

Given OSU-Cascades‚Äô smaller size, the Bend campus will offer a higher complement of fall courses on-site, while also creating remote learning options so that OSU-Cascades students also have a choice of where to live and study. A separate communication that provides information on fall instruction at OSU-Cascades is [available here](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/speeches-and-statements/osu-cascades-provide-variety-fall-instruction-modalities). The additional details we offer below apply to the Corvallis campus unless noted otherwise.

The decision to deliver instruction primarily virtually on our Corvallis campus was difficult. However, it is fully consistent with the principles we established in our resumption plan, which the Board of Trustees will review on Friday for consistency with guidelines issued by local and state health authorities and the Higher Education Coordinating Commission. While current conditions on our Corvallis campus remain at Level 2 of the university‚Äôs [four public health levels](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/s/tdml14g559oah972olzvwzs46d2e39gk), conditions are trending toward Level 3. Although the path of the virus remains uncertain, students, faculty and staff need clarity regarding fall teaching and operations in order to prepare for the term.

The university‚Äôs COVID-19 [Safety and Success website](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/) and [this video](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_oxupk2bk) offer details on what OSU will look like this fall. The following provides an outline, with a focus on instruction and student life. We will provide additional information on other operations in coming days.

**Choice:** To the greatest extent practicable, we are providing students with the ability to decide the location that works best for them to pursue their OSU studies. If a student feels safest living at home or off-campus and taking OSU courses remotely, almost all of our instruction will support that choice. If they choose to live on campus while they pursue their studies (mostly remotely and online), they are welcome at OSU.

Over 90 percent of OSU Corvallis course sections will be offered remotely. Courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs and field courses. Therefore, some students‚Äîespecially advanced undergraduates and graduate students‚Äîmay need to be in Corvallis in order to take those courses and continue progressing in their degree programs. The [OSU Schedule](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/) of Classes lists the instructional modality or format for each course: on-site/in-person, remote, a blend of on-site/in-person and remote, and online through Ecampus. Regardless of instructional modality, courses will be compelling and engaging, supporting students in achieving their academic goals.

**Living on campus:** Residence halls will be open to students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Capacity will be reduced to offer only single and double occupancy rooms and to create space for use in isolating and quarantining, should it be needed. We have adjusted our First Year Experience Live-on policy so that all first-year students otherwise subject to this policy may make the choice to remain at home. If students elect to stay at home and attend OSU remotely, no exemption request is required. Students with a current UHDS contract who decide to stay home must cancel their contract by emailing [housing@oregonstate.edu](mailto:housing@oregonstate.edu).

Buildings with classrooms and teaching laboratories for in-person instruction and applied learning will be open during fall term, along with the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, buildings that provide students with student services and study spaces, child care, health and wellness, food services and emergency assistance. Advising services will be mostly provided remotely.

**Living near campus.** We know that many students remain in and around Corvallis during the summer months while others will return to the area in order to utilize the university‚Äôs facilities, information technology infrastructure, and support programs while taking remote or online courses. Therefore, the campus will be open under modified conditions to support those students, and we will have public health measures and COVID-19 testing protocols in place. We ask all students, faculty and staff accessing the campus and living in the Corvallis community to be vigilant in adhering to OSU, local and state public health guidelines, and to participate in voluntary virus testing.

**Public health measures:** The multiple public health measures we have implemented include [physical distancing](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-040_COVID19_social_distancing) and [face covering requirements](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-041_COVID19_face_covering); enhanced cleaning protocols within university buildings; isolation and quarantine rooms in residence halls; improved HVAC filtration, where possible; expanded availability of hand sanitizer; and other public health measures recommended by local and state health officials. These measures are working well and have helped OSU to offer selected programs and services on-site and in-person over the summer.

**On campus testing:** We will test continuously for the prevalence of the virus that causes COVID-19 on the Corvallis and OSU-Cascades campuses and at the Hatfield Marine Science Center with the expert guidance of OSU researchers leading the [TRACE-COVID-19](https://trace.oregonstate.edu/) project. In addition to prevalence testing, we will monitor wastewater on our campuses and at HMSC for the presence of the virus. We are also exploring providing an initial test to students who choose to live on campus in Corvallis and students arriving from out-of-state hotspot communities.

**Financial assistance and student fees:** The OSU Board of Trustees froze tuition rates for the 2020-21 academic year for continuing OSU undergraduates enrolled in Corvallis, Bend, Portland and at Eastern Oregon University; we are increasing need-based financial aid assistance for eligible students; and we are preserving scholarship offers for students who elect to study elsewhere in the fall and return to OSU in a subsequent term. As well, fees associated with Student Fee-funded programs are now under review by student leaders. Information on any student fee reductions will be provided after the student fee committees complete their review.

**Research and Extension.** Campus-based research activities and fieldwork will follow existing resumption [guidelines](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/keep-researching) and on-site OSU Extension activities around the state will take place as local conditions permit.

We certainly had hoped that we would be at a different place in the national battle with COVID-19 by this point in the summer, such that we would be able to return to a significant complement of on-site and in-person instruction for fall term. However, we believe that by shifting to a primarily virtual instructional format, while also offering a limited mix of on-site teaching that facilitates students‚Äô continued progress toward their degree, we will maintain a low density of activity on the Corvallis campus and help minimize the spread of COVID-19. Of course, we are prepared to pivot to fully remote operations if public health considerations dictate such a decision.

We sincerely appreciate the patience and understanding of all members of the OSU community as we adjust to ever-changing pandemic conditions and public health circumstances. Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health and success.

As resilient members of Beaver Nation, we will continue to respond, adapt and recover from these challenging times and become an even stronger community and better university for all we serve.

Sincerely,

F. King Alexander¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

Somebody else posted about this recently, but OSU administration is about to begin drastic reductions to the overall capacity of student health services, starting with the permanent elimination of the SHS pharmacy. *Some people* responded to the other post with some ""spicy"" accusations of phishing attempts....it was not a phishing attempt, and making accusations of such things is very counterproductive in this context. If you lack the patience to wait for someone to verify sources, don't get involved. 

  
Anyway, I ran into one of the SHS pharmacy technicians at Fred Meyer a few days ago. I knew this technician because they helped me acquire travel meds for an internship last year. They told me that the pharmacy was told without warning that they'd be closing at the end of the term. Apparently there was a degree of animosity between Grace Kuo, dean of the College of Pharmacy, and (I think) Jennifer Davis, the director of the SHS pharmacy; according to the technician, the director was defending the pharmacy, and that was one of the reasons she became a scapegoat. Apparently the director offered her resignation in exchange for the promise that the pharmacy would remain active, which was obviously not the case. 

The other piece of information the technician gave to me is that OSU is going to **permanently eliminate Student Health Services and replace it with a privatized service offered by Samaritan Health** in five years. 

Of course, the reasoning for both of these changes boils down to money. Despite that various university sports coaches are still being paid their exhorbitant salaries (even in the absence of actual sporting events), the fact that the SHS Pharmacy helps train students from the College of Pharmacy, and the fact that having a school pharmacy *might help a little during a global pandemic,* the pharmacy is somehow higher on the list for being eliminated.

As far as my source, I have every reason to trust the technician who gave me this information; this technician went above and beyond his duties to help me acquire the medication I needed for my internship last year, and was very honest about the realities of acquiring certain medications in quantity and the probability of my insurance covering them. For sake of protecting their future job prospects, I am not going to identify the technician; they are one of [the staff members listed at the bottom of this webpage](https://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/pharmacy), and that is the furthest I am willing to go. 

I don't know what  to do about this, and I probably don't have time to help very much with it. The only real idea I have for confronting this is that some of the organizations that help fund the College of Pharmacy might not like to find out that the school is getting rid of their own pharmacy to save money instead of pulling funds out of their expensive sports programs. The SHS pharmacy is a very direct means of training students who want to become pharmacists, and it's hard to frame the loss of the pharmacy as anything other than a loss to the students in the College of Pharmacy, and to the university as a whole. 

I don't know if it would work, but if someone could demonstrate to the organization(s) providing funding to the College of Pharmacy that OSU has degraded the functionality to the college for the sake of saving money, it might make the donors/grant committees a little unhappy.",1,595,90.2,25.56,33.67,20.23,33.06,24.87,89.58,67.9,56.81,11.6,5.71,3.19,0,0.17,0.5,1.51,5.88,19.33,11.43,0.84,17.31,7.23,4.2,3.87,1.34,13.61,4.71,3.87,3.53,1.34,0.17,1.85,11.93,0.5,11.43,2.69,1.68,1.01,2.52,0.84,3.19,0,3.36,1.68,1.68,0.34,0,0.34,0,0.17,0,0,9.08,4.37,1.68,0.34,0.67,0.5,0.67,4.87,0,0,0.34,0.17,0.34,0,0,0.34,7.39,0.5,0,5.71,1.18,0.17,4.37,4.2,0.17,0,0,0,0,0.17,0,0.17,0.17,0.84,0.67,0,0,0,0.84,0,4.37,6.05,0.17,1.01,4.2,0.34,0,0.17,3.03,4.2,3.87,1.85,0,0,0,0,0,13.45,4.37,4.03,0,0,1.01,4.03,0

Hi guys!

Attached to this post you will find a link with a google drive containing PDFs for certain courses at OSU.

It might help someone save some $$$ so I just wanted to throw it out.

If you have any PDFs you would like to add let me know! I would like to establish a library users can come back to if needed!

\- MTH 256: Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems, William F. Trench w/ Solution Manual

\- ENGR 211: Statics & Dynamics, Hibbeler, 14th Edition (should also be valid for ENGR 212)

\- CH 331-332: Organic Chemistry, Paula Bruice, 7th Edition

\- ENGR 201: Fundamentals of Electric Circuits, Charles K. Alexander, 5th Edition. I think this would also be the book for 202 and 203?

\- CHE 320: Chemical Process Safety: Fundamentals With Applications, Crowl, Louvar, 3rd Edition

Dear OSU Corvallis students,
 
We write to announce decisions regarding instruction for winter term for the Corvallis campus.
 
Based on continued careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 pandemic locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU‚Äôs Corvallis campus will continue providing instruction primarily through remote modalities for winter term 2021. Winter term plans for the OSU-Cascades campus will be announced by Oct. 15. 
 
We will continue to use remote delivery to contribute to student wellness and educational success, limit the density of activity on-campus and in the Corvallis community, and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19. As with fall term, courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs, field courses and some graduate courses.
 
By the time registration opens in mid-November, the OSU Schedule of Classes will list the instructional modality for each course, as determined in consultation with academic units. Our aim is to limit the need for students to change where they live based on how winter term courses are offered.
 
We plan to have the following building open on the Corvallis campus during winter term: those with classrooms and teaching laboratories used for in-person instruction and applied learning, UHDS residence halls and dining centers, the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, Valley Library, and other buildings that provide child care, Student Health Services, food services, emergency assistance and study spaces (such as LInC). OSU updates the open/closed buildings list regularly. Student advising will continue to be provided mostly remotely.
 
Residence halls will continue to be open for students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Students who chose to remain in their home community during fall term but wish to live on campus for winter and spring terms are welcome to live on campus. Visit University Housing & Dining Services‚Äô or email housing@oregonstate.edu.
 
As we plan for spring term, we will closely monitor COVID-19 conditions and if possible, provide increased in-person instruction, extra-curricular and experiential learning opportunities for students. We will communicate more details on spring term as winter term is underway.
 
Winter term tuition and fees will be the same as fall term. Student fees for the academic year will be based upon recommendations from student leaders in Corvallis and at OSU-Cascades.
 
Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health, safety and educational success. Thank you for being a resilient and responsible member of Beaver Nation.
 
Sincerely,
 
F. King Alexander

Are their any requirements or other guidelines on what sort of experience or background (etc) for teachers/instructors/professors?

I thought we were paying for (at the very least) and getting a quality education but at the same time I have had teachers that are using material from 10 + (+++?) years ago and others that have absolutely no experience, education or any apparent relevant background in topics that they are teaching. How is this acceptable?

What about material that is relevant to the world today (not outdated)?

Do you find this to be true as well?Do you find this to be disheartening?

What can be done about it?

In reality we are the customer/client paying OSU et all for an education but why is it that we have no say in the quality of this education?

This on-campus pharmacy is the closest pharmacy available to Oregon State University students and provides numerous services like free 12-month contraceptives and immunizations for MenB outbreaks - eventually COVID-19 as well. It's been able to fill prescriptions for 9,000 students every year, and OSU want to shut it down forever. Right now especially we are seeing the impact and importance of accessibility to healthcare, and a population of university students are no exception to this. This decision as been made without clearly considering the impact this will have.

To address our unprecedented global and immediate need for access to reading and research materials, as of today, March 24, 2020, the Internet Archive will suspend waitlists for the 1.4 million (and growing) books in our lending library by creating a National Emergency Library to serve the nation's displaced learners. This suspension will run through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.
During the waitlist suspension, users will be able to borrow books from the National Emergency Library without joining a waitlist, ensuring that students will have access to assigned readings and library materials that the Internet Archive has digitized for the remainder of the US academic calendar, and that people who cannot physically access their local libraries because of closure or self-quarantine can continue to read and thrive during this time of crisis, keeping themselves and others safe.

Bring your water bottles from home, use that water fountain as much as you can! Quench your thirst knowing that you will be aiding me, a grad student, with winning a challenge in his lab. 

YOU are the unnamed hero of this story. YOU are the reason our environment is going to be a-ok. YOU will be the reason I claim victory over my lab mates. YOU are my only hope. 

Some info: 

* The counter only ticks when it's from filled water bottles and not just the mouth spout thing

* **This is the water fountain by the display case with the robot stuff in it and right next to all the seminar/poster information**

* PM with questions and/or if you need to know which water fountain. I will personally show you.

I don't think my lab class in the spring has the capability to be taught remotely, aside from lectures.

To say that it's fair to charge this much for remote teaching ""Because it's not ecampus"" is ridiculous. Our community is working so hard to provide so much for its citizens and yet nothing has been done to help with tuition forgiveness/extension.

Are there any other students who are frustrated about this? In my case, I can't even go home because I'm from Washington, and the majority of the out-of-state students here are from California and Washington.

Can do research on these systems / organize research for students to use as tools while discussing the software 

Can contact faculty and administration 

Can reach out to other schools and groups to form a unified front on the matter

And much more.

It seems like many of us are thinking the same thing. OSU is announcing of some classes in person to keep enrollment from plummeting. Now the thing is, I do think they are trying their best to keep classes on campus. But in reality, I think it‚Äôs risky to bring back thousands of people from all over back to Corvallis. The 8 week term idea is great. I always found the weeks in between thanksgiving and finals to be quite awkward. But I‚Äôm sure they know that with a influx of people returning to Corvallis, there‚Äôll be people celebrating/catching up at bars(if they open) and quite a bit of parties, especially in the first couple of weeks. It‚Äôll be hard to enforce social distancing when people haven‚Äôt seen their friends in months & with many living in the same house. So I‚Äôm curious to see how that will be handled. I mean, I‚Äôm all for people living their lives, but for those who are trying to be safe and cautious, it‚Äôs going to be hard.

I feel bad for the incoming Freshmen. They‚Äôre signing up for most, if not all, of their classes being online since they‚Äôll be taking prerequisites with way more than 50 people in the class. It sucks that OSU is still encouraging dorming knowing that most of their classes will be online. If I was an incoming freshmen, I would start at CC this fall & transfer when classes are back to on campus normally. 

Based off my own class schedule for the Fall, I‚Äôm only on campus for a couple days a week as most of the lectures are already scheduled to be delivered remotely. But, personally, I find it quite annoying that I‚Äôm only going to campus for a recitation and a lab. I find it more annoying because these classes can be done remotely. I guess it‚Äôs just that I have to fly back to Oregon for 8 weeks & go to campus for 2-3 days just for lab and recitation. I know it‚Äôs my choice to do so, but if I don‚Äôt, then I push off graduating next spring. 

I feel like a lot of people are going to be in similar positions. Lectures are going to be 
delivered remotely, but recitation and labs will be on campus. What are your thoughts or concerns? I‚Äôm curious as to what others are thinking.",1,422,46.32,12.64,98.44,26.43,17.58,16.11,94.31,77.01,59.72,14.69,9,5.69,0.24,0.24,0,2.61,5.69,12.09,4.5,1.42,17.77,12.8,5.21,6.64,0.71,23.46,7.35,6.64,2.61,1.18,1.18,0.47,13.98,0.71,13.03,5.21,0.95,1.18,2.84,0,4.27,0,2.84,1.66,1.18,0.95,0.24,0.71,0,0.47,0,0,6.64,2.13,0.24,0,0.47,0,0.71,4.27,0,0.24,0,0,0.71,0,0,0.71,6.87,0.71,0.24,5.92,0,0,0.71,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.47,0,0.95,0,0,0,0,0.71,0.47,8.29,10.66,0.24,3.08,7.35,0.47,0,0.95,5.69,2.37,7.58,3.55,0.24,0.24,0,0,0,15.88,5.45,4.27,0.24,0,4.03,1.9,0
