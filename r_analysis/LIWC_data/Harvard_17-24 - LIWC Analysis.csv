Furthermore, I do not trust that my brother will be responsible once he is allowed to practice. He’s used to be—no, he IS a conman! And I can handle a conman, but him with a law degree is like a chimp with a machine gun! I decided to make him aware of these opinions on Thursday, at our family Thanksgiving dinner. He then started to scream at me like a child, saying that I “never cared about him!” I spoke a few hurtful words in retaliation. I’m not wrong though, I could never make a mistake like this! He’s getting his degree from Cornell for Christ’s sake, what a joke! He defecated through a sunroof when he was an undergraduate and I saved him! I shouldn’t have. I helped him get a job in the mailroom at my own firm! What was I thinking? He’s turned our entire family against me, convincing them that I’m too prideful! He’s been stealing money off our parents since he was nine, convincing them that he’s just their precious little boy! And he’s going to become a lawyer? What a sick joke!

Now, contrary to the title of this post, I am not saying that no one should study computer science. Rather, the title is hyperbolizing but emphasizing the fact that you should approach the prospect of studying computer science with some hesitation, especially at Harvard. Studying computer science is not that much of a straightforward choice anymore. However, despite the exaggerated title, I honestly suggest that no one studies *only* computer science, without pairing it with a joint or double concentration in an adjacent field (e.g statistics, mathematics, physics and applied math). This is simply my opinion, which I think is an unpopular one, but I am just giving my perspective.

Reasons for not studying computer science:

1. *Oversaturated Job Market*: The job market is oversaturated, as there have been an influx of computer science degrees over recent years. It used to be that studying computer science at many universities would guarantee a solid job and studying computer science at Harvard would almost guarantee some kind of well-paying, entry-level big tech job. This is not the case anymore, just getting a computer science degree at Harvard isn't enough anymore. On top of taking and studying CS classes, companies are expected students to do personal projects/research or past internships, regardless of what school you go to, for internships and entry-level positions. In addition to that, passing interviews requires a rigorous study and practice of Leetcode-type problems.

The point is that studying computer science is losing relevance in terms of getting a tech job because employers are recognizing more the fact that computer science is not the same as software engineering. In my opinion, employers aren't necessarily prioritizing computer science students that much anymore for SWE/tech jobs over other STEM students (math, physics, and engineering) students. What you learn in most of your CS courses, which tend to be more theoretical, don't matter that much for doing the job. You literally need a basic understanding of coding (i.e. syntax, loops, functions, conditionals) and then some foundational understanding of data structures and algorithms (which you can get from leetcode). Leetcode-style problems aren't even typically relevant when you get to the job, but having a notion of efficiency is important. Even algorithms classes like CS120 and CS124 don't help immensely with leetcode. CS124 can help make **starting** leetcode easier, but you won't be able to solve leetcode problems well just after taking that class. You still need to practice.

Even if computer science classes like CS124 were tremendously helpful, the point is that many students take these kinds of classes, not just computer science students. CS124 is a very popular course among math, physics, and applied majors as well. In fact, the students who usually perform the best in these classes are people with more mature mathematical backgrounds. Employers don't really care if you've taken a breath of computer science courses; they're just looking for basic competencies in programming and interview material. A math major who's has a background in algorithms is essentially equivalent to a CS major who's taken an algo course + a bunch of other CS courses when it comes to competing for tech jobs, especially if both have the adequate amount of outside-the-classroom experiences. Heck, sometimes studying STEM doesn't even matter. There's a decent number of humanities concentrators who end up working as software engineers after graduation.

2. *Intellectual Return and Pedagogy.* I would argue that studying computer science over other STEM fields doesn't provide much of an intellectual and even knowledge benefit. As I mentioned, a lot of the concepts you learn in computer science courses aren't directly relevant to jobs in the industry. The fact is, you are probably going to forget most of the stuff you learned in your computer science classes a few months after you graduate. Heck, it's likely you can barely remember material from courses a month after the semester ends. The most important concepts you learn from college is how to *problem-solve* and how to *learn*.

While I would say that studying computer science does improve problem-solving, critical thinking, and logical reasoning skills, other STEM fields seem to be more effective at doing this for pedagogical and natural reasons. Specifically at Harvard, and also at other universities, computer science courses are generally not as well taught as other types of STEM classes. This pedagogical gap happens because material tends to be glossed over in computer science classes, while math and statistics classes focus more on subtleties and foundational concepts. This also seems to be because the computer science department is very research-oriented while other departments, especially statistics, tend to focus more on teaching. Most computer science professors treat teaching as presenting basic concepts needed to understand their research while other professors pay more careful attention to how they introduce a concept to their students.

An important idea is that computer science is literally a **branch of mathematics.** Therefore, many computer science concepts rely on using math skills. If you have a solid math background, which you can develop by studying subjects like math, physics, and engineering, transitioning to computer science is not really that difficult. Someone who studied computer science for years may start out with more knowledge than you, but they might not necessarily be better at solving computer science problems. Domain-specific knowledge isn't critical for solving many problems in computer science, because the knowledge can be picked up relatively quickly if you're comfortable with mathematics. This does not mean that people who study computer science don't also have the skills to comfortably transition to math and engineering, but it is easier to go from math/engineering/physics to computer science than vice versa. Even if you're interested in going into academia for CS, I don't think you get that much advantage from studying it over students studying adjacent-fields.

TLDR: Don't only study computer science. At the minimum, pair it with something else.

(Red Scare Over Cambodia - https://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/2/28/red-scare-over-cambodia-pbpbress-poison/). 

Thus my question is, has the Crimson ever retracted/apologized for their support for a regime that it is not hyperbolic to say is comparable to Nazis in their crimes against humanity, and is there anywhere I can read it.",1,196,64.29,12.03,83.42,2.73,28,27.04,84.18,67.86,54.08,8.16,4.08,2.55,0,0,0,1.53,4.08,14.29,10.2,2.55,12.24,9.18,8.16,7.14,1.53,15.82,8.16,2.04,6.63,0,0,6.63,13.27,1.02,11.22,3.06,1.02,0.51,3.06,0.51,4.59,0,4.59,1.02,3.57,1.02,0,1.02,1.02,0,0,0,7.65,5.1,2.04,1.02,0,0,2.55,2.55,0,0,0,0,5.61,3.06,1.53,1.02,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.53,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.53,0,0,0.51,0,0.51,0,0,0,0,4.59,10.71,0,1.53,6.12,3.57,0,0,6.12,3.57,9.69,0.51,0,0,0,0,0,15.31,3.57,5.61,0,0,1.02,5.1,0

Some people here really seem to just do everything perfectly. They have perfect grades (some in pretty hard concentations), have ethereal extracurricular contributions while also having a great social life. Looking at Rhodes and Marshall scholars, for example, really makes me wonder how some people manage to accomplish so many things.

For me, personally, I think I've always worked hard throughout college, so I don't really regret anything in terms of my work ethic. I study a challenging concentration (e.g a combo CS, Math, Stat, Physics), have a solid GPA, and landed a solid internship this summer. I do realize there are times when I could have done things more optimally and taken advantage of more opportunities, but some people really make me wonder if there is so much more I can do.

There are some students here, particularly the people who win prestigious fellowships and awards (Hoops, Summa, Phi Beta Kappa, etc.) who really make doing college look ridiculously easy. Like, I seriously wonder if these people are ever challenged at all during their college life.

My question is how do these people achieve these things? I know they work hard and have excellent time-management skills, but it can't just be as simple as that. I'm trying to see what they do to see how I can improve, though I guess there's not much I can do in college since I'm going into my senior year.

I'm really close to dropping out. Why does this feel like an undergrad school? I'm a first year PhD and I've been really sad lately at how little there is to get involved in as a graduate student. Most of the resources and opportunities that make Harvard a special place are reserved for undergraduates.

Most of the best clubs and orgs are only for undergraduates. Crimson, the entirety of theatre, lampoon, etc..

The amazing residential life system is only for undergrads. The parties in finals clubs are only for undergrads. What are grad students even supposed to do outside of research? Join the badminton club?? 

In my undergrad I did a lot of writing and theatre as an outlet and now I'm basically banned from doing either in any of the most active organizations.

Going to a bar and drinking with friends is sooo boring.. I wanna actually do shit. The mountaineering club has been really nice and let me join. Idk it's just hard to make friends outside your lab group and no one really cares. There are no school wide events for graduate students. No culture of going to the Harvard-Yale game. 

Some people tell me that this is what graduate school is like everywhere. That most of the institutions are primarily focused on making the undergraduate life as best as it can be. Graduate school is like a job they say, you're supposed to just sit around in lab all day. I didn't know this.. I thought I go to a research institution. To a school where they'd care about making sure we had lives outside of research and had outlets to keep our mental health straight.

Honestly I'm really disillusioned by Harvard and I'm close to dropping out. I'm in CS and turned down a job that pays six figures to join Harvard. I feel horrible. If anyone could tell me I'm wrong and help me find ways to pursue my passions (theatre, writing, lampoon, crimson, etc.) or find opportunities for things outside of lab that would be amazing.

While I don’t plan on going to grad school immediately after grad, I do plan on going at some point (i.e 1-3 years after grad). 

I guess my advice to incoming freshman: Get involved with research as soon as you get to campus, especially if you have any thought of going to grad school in the future. Research is also a way to show initiative and independence to employers. 

Now, since I’ve messed up and only have one year, I’m trying to make the best out of my current situation. I’m writing a thesis and am truly trying to do my best on that.

""Dear Members of the Harvard Community,

Over the last 12 days, the encampment in Harvard Yard has disrupted our educational activities and operations. The right to free speech, including protest and dissent, is vital to the work of the research university. But it is not unlimited. It must be exercised in a time, place, and manner that respects the right of our community members to do their work, pursue their education, and enjoy the opportunities that a residential campus has to offer. The encampment favors the voices of a few over the rights of many who have experienced disruption in how they learn and work at a critical time of the semester. I call on those participating in the encampment to end the occupation of Harvard Yard.

The disruptions from this encampment at the heart of the University have been numerous. Harvard College exams and other important activities and events have had to move elsewhere. Safety concerns over the past two weeks, including those raised as a result of students sleeping outdoors overnight, have required us to sharply limit access to Harvard Yard. Although some community members have said they are undisturbed by these conditions, we continue to hear reports of students whose ability to sleep, study, and move freely about the campus has been disrupted by the actions of the protesters. We are especially troubled by increasing reports that some within, and some supporting, the encampment have intimidated and harassed other members of our community. When Harvard staff have requested to see IDs in order to enforce our policies, supporters of the encampment have at times yelled at them, tried to encircle them, and otherwise interfered with their work. We have also received reports that passers-by have been confronted, surveilled, and followed. Such actions are indefensible and unacceptable.

As first-year students move out and as we begin our extensive preparations for Commencement, this ongoing violation of our policies becomes more consequential. Thousands of family members, friends, and loved ones will soon join us to celebrate the achievements of graduate and undergraduate students who have earned the right to walk in Commencement. This celebration is the culmination of years of hard work and accomplishment. The members of the Class of 2024 deserve to enjoy this milestone uninterrupted and unimpeded. It would be especially painful if students who graduated from high school or college during the pandemic were denied a full graduation ceremony for a second time.

The individuals participating in the activities of the encampment have been informed repeatedly that violations of University and School policies will be subject to disciplinary consequences and that further violations and continued escalation will result in increasingly severe sanctions. Last week, faculties across the University began delivering disciplinary notices to students who continued to participate in unauthorized, disruptive activity in the Yard despite these notices.

I write today with this simple message: The continuation of the encampment presents a significant risk to the educational environment of the University. Those who participate in or perpetuate its continuation will be referred for involuntary leave from their Schools. Among other implications, students placed on involuntary leave may not be able to sit for exams, may not continue to reside in Harvard housing, and must cease to be present on campus until reinstated.

Enforcement of these policies, which are essential to our educational mission, is an obligation we owe to our students and the Harvard community more broadly. It is not, as some have suggested, a rejection of discussion and debate about the urgent issues that concern the University, the nation, and the world. As an academic institution, we do not shy away from hard and important questions. There are many ways for our community to engage constructively in reasoned discussion of complex issues, but initiating these difficult and crucial conversations does not require, or justify, interfering with the educational environment and Harvard’s academic mission. Our disagreements are most effectively addressed through candid, constructive dialogue, building not on disruption, but on facts and reason.

Sincerely,
Alan M. Garber """,1,679,88.04,80.43,26.91,30.23,21.9,33.28,85.57,62.3,51.84,8.84,5.01,0.29,2.65,0,0,1.18,3.83,15.91,8.25,0.74,16.64,7.51,1.77,6.77,1.03,11.63,5.89,3.83,10.16,5.6,2.8,2.06,7.66,0,7.66,1.47,1.47,0.74,1.18,0.29,3.09,0,3.98,2.36,1.62,0.88,0.44,0.44,0.15,0,0,0,13.84,4.57,0.29,0.29,0.88,0.29,2.21,9.13,0.29,0.15,0,0,0.74,0.59,0,0.15,8.98,0.29,0.29,8.25,0.15,0,0.88,0.44,0.29,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.77,0,0.44,0,0.15,0,0.29,0.74,0.29,5.01,7.66,0.29,1.18,5.45,0.15,0.29,0.29,3.98,3.09,2.65,1.47,0,0,0,0,0,11.78,4.42,6.19,0,0,0.29,0.88,0

I’m a pretty social, outgoing person. I get along easily with people and I really wanted to have a large group of friends who I can just socialize with and hang out with. I did recruitment for several RSOs, and I was so excited thinking now I could have a bunch of people to spend time with, go out with, be friends with.

I was so happy thinking about having a “family” on campus. I have plenty of friends at Harvard, but I really wanted a solid friend group who I could hang out with all the time, go out to eat with, and get super close to. Not just sporadically see or study with.

I got rejected from every single RSO I did recruitment for. I don’t know why. I thought we had great conversations, I thought I vibed with the people. I thought I was going to have friends. This hurts so much worse because it’s not a rejection based on academics or skills. The criteria for joining an RSO is that you’re the type of person they want to be friends with.
It’s a rejection of me as a person. The members for multiple organizations each got together, multiple times, and sat down and agreed I’m not someone they’d ever want to spend time with or be around. 

I don’t know what’s wrong with me that none of them at all would have me as a friend. Wondering what I did wrong. Was I not fun enough, not social enough, not friendly enough? I thought our conversations were great. 

I feel like now I’ve missed my chance. I’ll never have a “family” like that now. I could try again next year. But I won’t be a first-year anymore, and why would people who don’t like me now like me then. I don’t know what I should’ve done differently.

(I am Joe Blitzstein, a professor in the Statistics Department. I teach Stat 110 and co-direct the Stat concentration.) Of course I'm the most knowledgeable about Stat courses but I also have many years of experience with academic advising more generally, as well as many years of hearing students tell me about their experiences in various math, applied math, CS, and other courses. 

I'm announcing this session only on Reddit. It will be next Tuesday 8/16 on Zoom (not on Reddit), starting at 8 pm ET, and running at least until 9 pm (maybe later depending on how many people show up). I haven't tried this before, and may end up alone in a Zoom room, but I get the sense that there are many questions from students, especially with the sad demise of shopping period. 

If you're a Harvard College student, I would love to see you there! I don't want to post the Zoom link publicly, so email me at [blitz@g.harvard.edu](mailto:blitz@g.harvard.edu) at least an hour in advance and I'll send you the link. If you're a Harvard grad student, feel free to email me also and we can figure out if it makes sense for you to attend this session or (if there is enough demand) one for grad students. 

Feel free also to drop by to say hi even if you don't have specific questions at the moment!",1,288,50.73,20.42,80.79,52.41,26.18,18.06,84.72,65.28,54.51,11.46,8.68,5.9,0.35,2.08,0,0.35,2.78,11.46,4.86,3.47,15.63,7.64,6.94,9.38,1.39,14.58,8.33,5.21,2.08,0.35,1.04,0.69,14.24,0,14.24,4.51,1.04,1.39,5.21,0.69,4.86,0,2.78,2.43,0.35,0.69,0.35,0.35,0,0,0.35,0,9.72,3.47,1.04,0.35,0,0.35,2.78,5.9,0,0,0,0,0.69,0,0,0.69,7.64,0,0.35,6.94,0.35,0,0.35,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.35,0,0.35,0.35,0.69,0.35,0,0,0,0,3.82,7.64,0.35,0.69,3.82,1.04,0.35,1.39,4.51,1.04,4.86,1.39,0,0,0,0,0,20.49,4.51,5.21,0,0.69,3.13,6.94,0

HGSU has been negotiating with Harvard admins (and their lawyers) for over six months now, and we’re proud of the progress we’ve made on dental coverage, compensation for cancelled sections, legal fees for international students, and working from home. But we’re still far from agreement on cost-of-living raises; impartial processes for retaliation, harassment, and discrimination; and our union’s funding structure. You may have heard that almost 2000 of us recently voted to authorize our bargaining committee to call a strike over these provisions if necessary.

We know members and non-members alike have a lot of questions about our next steps! We’re working to gather as much democratic input as possible through direct outreach, membership meetings, informal surveys (watch your inboxes!), town halls, and…this AMA! We’d also love to hear from community members outside our bargaining unit.

We are elected leaders of HGSU here to hear and respond to your questions, thoughts, and concerns. Ask us anything!

Context: The president of Mexico has a daily morning ""press conference"", which is broadcast on social networks (but in reality it is propaganda for him, his political party or his interests) and in one of them he exclaimed that people who study at Harvard learn to steal.

More context: Of course, the consensus of rational Mexicans is that these words are absolute nonsense, however, in this period, unfortunately, many irrational people are sharing this kind of speech by the president.

These speeches are a way of indoctrinating the exaltation of patriotism/nationalism, where the rhetoric is that foreigners are ""evil by nature"" and thay ""they prevent us from developing because they only want to take advantage of us"", in addition to demeaning the education, in a country like Mexico where half of its population only completes the first half of secondary education, this kind of speech in general mobilizes the masses who are looking for an imaginary enemy, generates feelings on ignorant people and unfortunately increases the popularity of the president.

Edit 2: I have been asked what specific tuition increase I'm referring to, here it is. In May 2021 I paid $1880 for a 4 credit HSS class. This year, that same class costs $3,500 ($2,120 if you are accepted into an ALB program). This means, The HSS tuition has increased 86% for non-enrolled students and 12% for enrolled students. A CNBC [study](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/27/college-tuition-is-now-rising-at-a-rate-lower-than-inflation.html) from October 2021 notes on average tuition and fees in US universities increased by 1.3%, making the Harvard increase excessive. Another [note](https://finaid.org/savings/tuition-inflation/) from [Finaid.org](https://Finaid.org) shows that tuition rates generally increase about 8% a year, which again makes the HSS increase excessive.

Edit: I have no idea why every single one of my responses are being downvoted. Listen, at HES, we're not the kids of hedge-fund managers, and some of us want to get a degree. But increasing tuition by 75% means we have to start over at another institution because it is no longer affordable. If you are of a socio-economic status that allows you to absorb that massive increase in cost, good for you. But don't try to silence poor or minority students who can't.",1,244,51.75,47.35,27.07,25.52,17.43,22.54,91.39,69.26,51.64,13.11,7.79,2.46,1.64,1.64,0.41,1.23,5.33,14.34,5.74,6.15,12.7,9.02,5.33,4.92,2.05,15.98,5.74,12.7,4.1,1.64,0.41,2.05,13.93,0.82,13.11,1.23,3.69,1.64,2.46,0,4.92,0,2.05,1.23,0.82,0.41,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,9.43,2.05,0,0,0,0,0.82,7.38,0,0,0,0.41,1.64,0.41,0,1.23,13.52,0,0,7.38,6.15,0,0.41,0.41,0.41,0,0,0,0,0,0,1.23,0.41,0.82,0,0.82,0,0,0,0,4.92,5.74,0.41,0.41,4.51,0,0.82,0,3.28,2.87,7.38,0.82,0,0,0,0,0,25,5.33,4.92,1.23,0,2.46,11.07,0

The author, who was a writer for the Crimson, maturely entitled their piece: ""From a Suspended Senior: With a Raised Middle Finger and Love in My Heart"" claimed the following:

>I grew up trans in rural Maine, **working in kitchens and painting houses**. I’ve come face to face with the law, **moved away from home** at 16. Where I’m from, going to college is not a given and leaving the state is uncommon.

>But in the spring of 2020, **living out of a garage loft without running water**, I became one of the first openly trans valedictorians in the country and the first person from my high school to get into Harvard.

What they left out is the widespread news coverage that appears to make clear that this is a warped version of the truth.  For example:

[https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian](https://wgme.com/news/local/belfast-senior-will-graduate-as-maines-first-transgender-valedictorian)

>The very first decision he made was to move out of his family’s house **and into their garage**, where he could live more independently. Since then, he has worked a number of minimum-wage jobs to support himself, buying his own food, clothes and other necessities. **His parents didn’t ask him to move out** **or pay his own way**, but it was something that the teen needed to do for himself.  
. . . 

>The teen’s fierce independence is part of his personality, according to his dad, **Belfast Mayor** Eric Sanders.

Having this context helps the Crimson's readers (and reddit users) obtain a greater understanding of the mentality and veracity of the suspended students that are claiming that they are victims of ""Harvard's injustice"".",1,270,89.52,66.21,34.51,24.98,27,21.48,87.41,65.93,52.22,12.22,8.52,2.22,0,0,4.44,1.48,3.7,17.78,9.26,2.59,16.67,6.3,1.85,4.81,0.74,15.56,4.81,3.7,4.07,1.48,0.74,1.85,9.63,0,9.63,2.22,1.11,0.74,1.11,0,4.07,0,1.85,1.11,0.74,0.74,0.37,0.37,0,0.37,0,0,14.81,2.96,0.74,0,0,0.37,0.74,11.48,1.11,0,0,4.81,1.11,0.37,0,0.74,7.04,0,2.59,3.7,0.74,0,3.33,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.74,0,0.74,0,1.11,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.7,12.59,0,2.59,9.26,1.11,0,0,0.74,4.44,4.44,0.74,0,0,0,0,0,31.48,4.81,5.19,0,0,3.33,18.15,0

I was in the Science Center on Wednesday, and I was having a pretty difficult day dealing with an upsetting situation. I was crying, a lot, sitting on one of the chairs/benches in the Science Center near the side exit toward the Kennedy School. I was on the phone with a friend, venting, and still crying. It was pretty clear that I was very upset and going through something difficult. 

Someone - a young guy who I assume was an undergrad - was walking by, saw me crying, came up to me and gave me a kind look trying to show empathy. He might have been wearing something blue, though it's hard to remember now. He might have mouthed something to try to console me without interfering with my call, or briefly asked me if I was OK. Then he stretched out his hand to me so that I could put my hand in his. I did. After that, I might have said to him that I'm OK, and maybe (hopefully) said thanks. 

To that guy: thank you for showing me compassion and empathy. Thank you for caring. Thank you for offering your hand to me. Your intuition was correct - I really needed human contact and support in that moment. I needed someone's hand. You were right to approach me and try to make sure that I was OK. What you did for me was not a small thing. It mattered a lot.

The distressing situation that had made me so upset will be resolved. I'll be fine. But thank you for helping me in that moment. More people at Harvard should be like you - but you more than make up for the ones who aren't.

TW: mentions of self-harm and suicide. Long post ahead, but I really need to get this out and get advice.

I'm a current sophomore here and to sum everything up, I am absolutely miserable at this school. When I first got into Harvard, I was so blinded by prestige that I just committed on a whim despite being fortunate enough to have many other good options to choose from. It's one of my biggest regrets to this day.

I'm not doing great academically; I came in pre-law but that has changed several times and I don't even know what I want to do anymore. I have other issues, but the worst part of it all is that I have literally no friends and feel like I don't belong anywhere here. Believe me, I have tried SO hard; up until this point, I would spend so many hours every week finding people to get meals with, joining tons of clubs, doing IM sports, quite literally everything people suggest doing to meet new people. But I never end up with any lasting friends no matter how hard I try to keep in touch, and many people have simply just flaked on me or abandoned me when we actually do make plans. I had really hoped it would get better sophomore year, but so far it's only been getting worse. I have nobody to talk to, nobody to hang out with, and every single day feels like the same thing on loop. Every night I just sit alone in my dorm either crying or feeling numb. I have struggled with suicidal thoughts in the past, but with things being so bad this year especially, it's worse than ever and I frequently find myself seriously thinking about ending things because what difference would it even make?

I have had great friends in high school and other places; it just feels like Harvard is the one place I don't click with anyone no matter how much I put myself out there, and the overall fake and toxic culture here doesn't help. I came to college hoping and even expecting that I would make at least a few great friends and have a fun college experience, but it's only making me so, so depressed and alone. I just want to be able to go out with friends once in a while, have someone to eat meals in the dining hall with. Is that really too much to ask?

I'm really on the fence about just sticking it out for 2 more years or seriously considering transferring somewhere else. I feel like the logical decision from a career/future perspective would be to just stick it out because firstly, I don't think it will look great on my resume/job applications, especially transferring from a school as renowned as Harvard. Also, if I transfer as a junior, I anticipate that it will be very difficult to integrate with the new school and make friends at this point. I'm so miserable at Harvard, but I'm worried to let go in case my efforts to transfer won't end up being worth it.

Could I please get some advice? I'm so desperate and sad and I really need some honest thoughts from people.

We want to make it clear that racism and anti-Semitism have no place here and [they never have](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/6ufdgj/a_note_about_controversial_posts/). We continue to remove content and ban accounts that promote racist or anti-Semitic content.

We are grateful to the community members who have reported this content; it has been immensely helpful.  Please continue to report.

# Data

\- Reddit's own Anti-Evil Operations have removed, confirmed removal, or deleted accounts active in this subreddit in 300 cases over the past four months. This number exceeds the total for the previous 15 years combined.

\- The moderators have removed five times more comments in the past month than in the last five years combined. Of these, 82% were reported for racism or anti-Semitism by community members, and we agreed with these reports. We appreciate your vigilance in reporting this hate and we are committed to cleaning it up.

# Some of the steps we're taking

* Educating ourselves on hate-speech
* Communicating between mods and with Reddit
* Removing violating content, banning offending users, reporting accounts to Reddit
* Documenting usernames, comments, and posts from offending accounts
* Locking comments when mod capacity is unavailable
* Updating content and automod policies as we learn more information
* Seeking opportunities to engage users regularly with content that promotes awareness and understanding of racism and anti-Semitism

# Request

Please continue to report content and behavior that violates [Reddit's site-wide policies](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) or our subreddit's rules. If you have additional ideas or feedback, please send the mods a message.

Do not engage in racism or anti-Semitism. We do not tolerate it to any degree. It is your responsibility to understand what constitutes racism and anti-Semitism. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum does [a good job of describing what racism and antisemitism are and how to recognize them](https://www.ushmm.org/learn). The National Museum of African American History and Culture has [good information on race and racism](https://nmaahc.si.edu/learn/talking-about-race/topics/race-and-racial-identity).

# Take care of your mental health

* [HUHS](https://camhs.huhs.harvard.edu/) offers virtual and on-site mental health counseling, including a 24/7 hotline for hate speech trauma and general mental health counseling.
* Talk to friends, family, or counselors for emotional support. Surround yourself with people who affirm your value. Consider seeking help from a mental health professional and practice self-care.
* The Grad School of Education provides a [free toolkit](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b7c56e255b02c683659fe43/t/6579c2a3dd7d84532898bab3/1702478502514/FHAO_MakingCaringCommon_OnlineHateSpeech.pdf) for talking with teens about online hate speech.

In short, the members of the discord have completely migrated over to a new discord with the previous mods as the owners.

Why did the members decide to change discords? As another [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/p3c2y9/wrong_discord_on_subreddit_sidebar/) mentions, this was due to issues with the ownership. The specific issues were summarized in that thread, but the thread was locked before other members could elaborate on the details. The owner was never present, took credit for the work the two main admins did, and refused to transfer ownership even after a vote among the moderators on discord. This server was massive, highly active, and a crucial social hub especially during the pandemic, but almost nobody knew who the owner was. In fact, the owner had as little as 13 messages in the server over several years. This all got intense over the last couple of months as the owner ghosted all of the members, including the admins.

Now, this all just seems like isolated discord drama. This directly relates to the subreddit as the owner and one other admin are the major moderators of this subreddit. Even though the new [discord server](https://discord.gg/invite/harvard) is the only active one of the two, the owner of the other discord server changed the link on the subreddit to redirect to their server rather than the active one.

All of these problems are a result of the moderation teams on both the previous discord and the current subreddit. The top moderators are not Harvard affiliated anymore and have been the main power holders for an extended period of time. We would not be opposed to the idea of alumni as moderators, but these particular moderators have shown no interest in being a part of the communities they are moderating and should pass off their roles to active members of the communities.

Perhaps instead of locking threads with questions and ghosting us more, you can take some time and answer them directly. Also, there is still a link to the discord on the subreddit. You should probably remove that if you are totally trying to disconnect from the discords.",1,378,93,67.92,24.32,17.18,21,23.28,84.39,69.31,59.26,6.61,2.65,0,0.53,0.79,0,1.06,3.97,23.02,14.29,1.85,16.4,7.67,5.56,6.61,1.32,10.32,7.14,6.08,6.61,2.91,0.53,3.17,14.29,2.38,11.9,2.65,1.59,1.59,1.59,0.53,3.97,0,1.32,0.53,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10.32,1.59,0.26,0,0.53,0,0.79,8.73,0,0,0,0,2.65,0.26,0,2.38,0.79,0,0,0.53,0.26,0,0.79,0.26,0.26,0,0,0,0,0,0.53,0.26,0,0.79,0,0,0,0,0,0,3.44,3.97,0,0.53,3.44,0,0,0,5.29,4.23,3.44,0,0,0,0,0,0,11.11,4.5,4.23,0.26,0,0,2.12,0

Harvard didn’t go how I expected. From the very start, I recall feeling unmotivated and struggling with even the easy stuff. I tried constantly, but never succeeded, in figuring out what is going on mental health wise. I really tried.

Without getting too specific, I regret how I spent my time at Harvard. I got into a particular club and thought it was a golden ticket to a particular path. It was a very Quixote-like because it was…not what I expected, and actually so, so much worse. It chewed me up and spit me out. I kept spending my time there thinking things would get better, but it was sunk cost fallacy thinking. I wish every day I put time into other activities.

I am consumed by regret and self-blame. I wake up in a panic over it. When I think of the “good times,” or the covid era when things were relatively calm and easy, before I joined the club, I feel legitimate fear. Does anyone have fear around nostalgia? I’ll remember something somewhat pleasant and feel absolute dread.  Like, why couldn’t I lock in at that moment? Why didn’t I do differently? Why didn’t I keep talking to that person I used to talk to? The gist of the thoughts is generally, “I was so safe then.” Maybe it’s because the rut I’m in has been causing some serious tension at home. It feels really scary.

Are there any alumni hanging around here who had a rough time at Harvard, and even the first few years out of school, but got back on their feet? I could really use some hope right now.

There are a few users on here (or maybe just one with multiple accounts) who seem bent on trashing Extension students at every mention of HES--relentlessly preaching their message that extension students don't get ""real"" Harvard degrees, going out of their way to put HES students in their place as subpar academic performers who only want the Harvard brand as a band-aid for their intellectual deficiencies...blah blah blah. 

But most of you aren't like that.

I had a chance to visit campus for a few weeks recently, and I was BLOWN away by your hospitality and welcoming me into the Harvard community. I met some of the nicest, smartest, and also humble students who went seriously out of their way to make me feel welcome. So much so that I didn't feel even a bit out of place.

As an extension student finishing up my last term, I'm so thankful for what has been the highest quality, most rigorous, and overall best educational experience of my life! And I'm especially thankful to all the Harvard community members who welcome older, nontraditional students like me into their midst.

So, thank you!

I was admitted to the class of 2027 a few months ago.

My biggest remaining question mark, though, are the people. What are people actually… like? I’ve run into two competing explanations and I don’t think either is fully or always true: everyone is either an obsessive networker or it’s just full of amazing magical super smart people.

I’m very well aware of how academia-oriented subreddits feel about Affirmative Action, I’m also aware that black people aren’t really the majority or even a significant amount of any of these spaces so I’m sure that this post won’t be received well but I have no idea where else to say it. I’m not here to talk about AA, so if you’re coming to debate, please pick another post.

But since AA has been stricken down I’ve been noticing a ton of subtle anti-blackness. This, as well as my awareness of how AA likely contributed to my admission as I’m black and native American, has been making me feel like I don’t deserve to be here, that I stole some other person’s spot. I got great grades and a high SAT and had good ECs that I would say are typical of a t20 student but doesn’t necessarily scream “HARVARD”, but still, I wasn’t an absolute sweat in high school like some of you folks, and when I hear these stories about how these 1600 SAT 4.0 GPA kids who did research at MIT in the 9th grade got rejected, I can’t help but feel like it’s my fault somehow?

""Following a meeting of the governing boards earlier today, my colleagues and I are very pleased to let you know that Alan Garber, our interim president since January, will serve as president of the University through the end of the 2026-27 academic year. We plan to launch a full-scale search for his eventual successor in the late spring or summer of 2026.

After serving with distinction as Harvard’s provost for more than twelve years, Alan has done an outstanding job leading Harvard through extraordinary challenges since taking on his interim presidential duties seven months ago. We have asked him to hold the title of president, not just interim president, both to recognize his distinguished service to the University and to underscore our belief that this is a time not merely for steady stewardship but for active, engaged leadership.

Over the last seven months, and for years before that, Alan has led with a deep concern for all members of the Harvard community, a strong devotion to enduring university ideals, and a paramount commitment to academic excellence. At an especially demanding moment for higher education, Harvard is very fortunate to benefit from his intellectual acumen and breadth of interests, his integrity and fair-mindedness, his equanimity and empathy, his decades-long devotion to the University, his extensive knowledge of its people and parts, and his ardent belief in the power of higher education and research—and their potential to improve the lives of people and communities near and far. His time in Mass Hall has demonstrated his clear-eyed determination both to help the University chart a course through troubled waters and to affirm the primacy of the teaching, learning, and research at Harvard’s heart.

In conversations with many people across our community and beyond during the past weeks and months—including especially helpful recent consultations with each of the deans as well as an array of faculty and alumni leaders from the various schools—we have consistently heard praise for Alan’s qualities and how his leadership meets the current moment. People have highlighted his thoughtful and balanced judgment, his openness to different points of view, his even temperament in turbulent times, his concern for student well-being, his commitment to academic freedom and constructive dialogue, his recognition of diversity and inclusion as integral elements of academic excellence, his appetite for innovation, and his constant focus on the best interests of Harvard as a whole. Our recent consultations have strongly underscored the high regard in which Alan is held by a broad range of people who have watched him work and come to appreciate his strengths.

Alan is not only an admired academic leader but also a scholar and educator of exceptional reach. After graduating from Harvard College *summa cum laude,* he earned a PhD in Economics from Harvard and an MD with research honors from Stanford University. A member of the Stanford faculty for 25 years, he became a professor of medicine, economics, and health policy, and was founding director of Stanford’s Center for Health Policy and its Center for Primary Care and Outcomes Research, while also practicing as a physician in Palo Alto. Since returning to Harvard in 2011 to serve as provost, he has held faculty appointments in Harvard Medical School, the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, and the Economics Department in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences. As the longest-serving provost in Harvard’s history, responsible for overseeing academic activities throughout the institution and working to foster new connections across the schools, he gained singular insight into the full span of opportunities and challenges facing the University.

As noted, Alan will carry forward as president through the 2026-27 academic year and we will launch a full and wide-ranging search for his successor in the late spring or summer of 2026. We believe this plan will give Alan and his leadership team the opportunity to sustain and build momentum on a range of priorities and initiatives. It will also provide an ample interval for those of us on the Corporation to reflect, in consultation with others, on how best to approach the future presidential search, including how to ensure robust input from across Harvard and beyond.

As we all know, these remain challenging times. We have experienced significant divisions and pointed questions. We have hard work still ahead to reaffirm our core academic values and our collective focus on learning and scholarship. We must continue working to restore bonds of trust, to bridge divides, to combat forms of invidious hate and bias, and to foster a secure campus climate conducive to dialogue across differences. No less, we have more work ahead to amplify higher education’s contributions to the wider world and to shine light on why they matter.

Alan’s talents and experience position him well to guide us in this vital work. Along with my colleagues on the governing boards, I hope you will offer him your concerted support, and I thank all of you—faculty, students, staff, alumni, and friends—for all you do for Harvard.

Sincerely,  
Penny Pritzker

I feel like kids (which is going to be a lot) who test positive upon coming to campus are going to have a bit of a rough time. I feel like most classes are ready to dive right into an in-person learning model without any contingency plans for students who are going to absent from lectures and class meetings due to quarantine.

Honestly, I feel like Harvard should have followed what other universities are doing and start the semester with a week or two online. I know that sucks and is an unpopular opinion, but if Omicron is spreading fast and a good portion of students are going to test positive in the first few weeks, going online might make things easier for students and professors alike.

I’ve frankly just gotten really frustrated with how the professors here have been grading us in my classes and maybe I just had it easier at my high school or something and I’m bitching for nothing?

But I just think it’s wrong when one of my classes has a policy that only a certain percentage of the class can get an A, so a 96 was the cutoff for an A (which I BARELY made). I just don’t understand how most of my professors proclaim that they’re not trying to pit us against each other and grades don’t matter and then implement systems like this? I went into my math final with a 100% and left with a B+ because I did average (as in I did 4 questions perfectly and the other 2 had some mistakes in it) on the final so that corresponded to a two letter grade drop..?

I’ve just become really jaded especially given that my math professor barely taught us this entire year and so as a result I was teaching myself basically everything. I’m just like maybe this is the reality of college? I hate how everyone talks about grade inflation at Harvard because I’ve had the exact opposite experience, I’ve only had my grades deflated despite putting in my absolute best. I’ve become frustrated because I can’t even enjoy learning anymore because I’m stressing out so much about my grade.

I keep telling myself to be thankful that I’m at Harvard and I absolutely am and don’t get me wrong, I’ve had an amazing academic and personal experience thusfar, I’ve just found that I feel like the way most classes are graded here actively pit students against each other.

I had my first research experience last semester and flopped on my research project. I basically got no work done and embarrassed myself in front of the professor that was advising me. This happened for two reasons: (1) I didn't manage time to work on the project properly and procrastinated on it, and (2) I wasn't that interested in the project to begin with. While I fully accept the responsibility for this failure and understand how I wasted the professor's time, I am a bit traumatized by this experience. The professor essentially told me and treated me like I was dumb and seemed apathetic from the start of the project when I asked for resources and feedback (it wasn't the professor's fault at all, but I'm saying what happened). I guess I'm a bit ashamed, as I left a bad impression on the professor, and I'm walking around a department where a professor thinks I'm incompetent and unintelligent.

I'm a good student and have excellent time management skills, in terms of managing heavy course loads at the very least. I also recognize that I failed because I was unaccustomed with the open-ended nature of research, and my lack of interest didn't help with that. I only did the research because I was looking for something to put on my resume rather than choosing something I genuinely wanted to explore and learn more about.

I think it is actually a good thing that this amounted to failure. First, I know that I need to be more organized next time to adequately allocate time to a long research project, and I know what things I can do to be make sure I'm spending the appropriate time and putting adequate effort. When I have to do my thesis, I now know that I can't procrastinate, and I need to properly structure my schedule to work on the project, so I can achieve the better results possible. Second, I now understand that it's important to choose research that you're interested in, so you're actually motivated to work on a project (this essentially applies to any work that I do) and don't just do things to put on your resume.

I know how to logically recover from this experience, but how do I mentally recover?

As a freshman that just started here, the Harvard comp process is a little bewildering. I totally understand clubs having application processes so that they can ensure that they have members that are committed, but why do they have to be so damn selective?

Like, I can understand the selectivity for pre-professional organizations like CBE and HCCG, but for clubs like Harvard T4SG (Tech Social Good), which yes is still pre-professional but has a purpose of social impact, they are literally taking like 10% of their applicants?! Like, why? It's literally a club for social good and one of the most useful clubs to get real software engineering experience, but they reject tons of applicants. Who said performing social good should be so exclusive? Again, even in clubs like the aforementioned, I'm not saying to accept everyone, but does it really make sense to basically make the application process just another round of college admissions, especially if you're a club that promotes itself as doing something that is ""good""?

Wouldn't it make more sense to have more of a completion-based comp, that's meant to be challenging to complete to successfully filter out inadequate prospective members?",1,201,30.24,26.56,8.2,50.81,22.33,24.38,90.05,71.14,57.71,12.94,5.47,1.49,0,0.5,0,2.99,7.46,11.94,5.47,1.49,13.43,12.44,8.96,6.97,1,19.4,7.46,3.48,7.96,4.48,1.99,1.49,19.4,1,18.41,2.49,3.98,2.49,1,1.49,5.97,0,5.47,3.48,1.49,2.49,1.99,0,0,0,0,0.5,10.45,2.49,0,0,0.5,0.5,1,5.97,0,0,0,0,1.49,0,0,1.49,8.46,3.48,0,4.98,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1.49,0.5,0.5,0,0.5,0,0.5,10.45,3.48,0.5,0,1.99,0,0,1,1,1.49,6.97,1.49,0.5,0,0.5,0,0,17.91,1,6.47,3.48,0.5,2.49,3.98,0

I'm excited for Harvard and all of the opportunities that will be available to me, but (probably like most everyone else) I'm quite a bit apprehensive about Harvard's social and academic environment. I'm coming from a fairly competitive public high school where I've befriended many intellectually curious people, but I've never experienced an environment where tons of people are top-notch in some way. 

I don't have any illusions of being a top student at Harvard. I view myself as being generally competent, well-rounded, and quicker in some subjects than others--and I'll work hard while I'm here--but I'm certainly no genius or creative savant. For those of you who were/are undergrad at Harvard, how did you navigate becoming an average student after being top of your class in high school? How did you overcome your impostor syndrome/jealousy to reap the intellectual and social benefits of being surrounded by so many unique and qualified people? Any general advice?

Thanks for taking the time!

I feel like I should use a throwaway for this (I'm pretty identifiable) but that's okay. 

I'm a first year student (college). I'm also international and have a disability - I'm blind - which doesn't help with all of this. I feel like no matter what I do, I can't find my place here. Last semester I joined some extracurricular activities, The Crimson and a Model UN  type org (although it's not Model UN), but other than adding something to my resume, I don't feel like I have any real friends from them . . I've tried talking to random people at Annenberg and I actually have people I could call my friends, but more than friends they are just people I hang out with and that's it. I feel like the relationships don't go any further. 

I also feel like I'm not taking advantage of everything Harvard has to offer- my flights were canceled so I got here late and when I did I caught Covid two days later, so I haven't been able to get involved in my extracurriculars this semester by attending meetings and such, and I feel like everyone else is doing so much more than me, or that I'm missing out on participating in clubs where I could actually meet nice, down-to-earth people (I'm not saying the ones I'm in the people aren't nice, but I feel like everything is so superficial and competitive...). 

I don't even know what I'm looking for by posting here, maybe advice or just knowing that I'm not the only one this is happening to, but it's all pretty overwhelming and I can't help but wonder if I really did the right thing by coming here. Back home I have real friends and family who miss me a lot, and here I have... well, Harvard, opportunities and so on, but I'm not as happy as I'd like to be and I really feel like I should do something to change that. I'd really appreciate any advice or comments or.... literally anything.

————-

I’m new to Harvard

Hello! 

I’m taking the plunge and have accepted admittance to grad school this fall. Besides all the worry of financial stuff, I’m pretty excited for this awesome opportunity! 

Questions:
1. I’m from the southwest with mild winters, how are winters in MA? 

Well, my area in the southwest received a lot more snow than Cambridge! Haha I was actually excited to experience a huge snowfall out here but nothing! I went home for most of December and January so I’m not sure if I missed the coldest days, but I managed. Bought a thick jacket, gloves and headwear so the cold was manageable. I did, however, feel like I was getting more and more weary of the cold, wet, windy, and cloudy days as winter wore on. I think I may have gotten a little depressed, because at times I didn’t want to do anything other than stay at my apartment and sleep. Missed the sun and dry air! 

2. I’m thinking of driving, epic road trip! I want to have a car there so I can explore New England. Pros/cons? Like will I need to register with MA? 

So, I didn’t bring my car in July, but I did drive back in January! So, it was ok to not have a car, I got a term Charlie pass and they helped a lot going around mostly between Harvard and MIT. If I wanted to go further, like Walmart (can’t help it) I used the zip cars located outside my building or nearby. 

After a while, I felt very constricted to where I wanted to go — first by how long it took to get to places using the public transportation, secondly by how zip cars were not always available and it was getting expensive (and time restrictions on the cars). 

Bringing my car helped me feel like I had the freedom to go places. Parking — my building has a garage — so my car was nearby in a protected space (from weather too) but it was 2k for the semester. I got towed twice in Cambridge and got like 2 tickets. I got an ez-pass for tolls. I didn’t have to get MA plates either. 

Freedom! I went to New Hampshire (scary), providence, and lots of other places. I generally love to drive… back home we drive a lot. But winter months it’s pretty bleak around here haha

Traffic— first month was intimidating but after that, just being a courteous and respectful driver helps. Traffic isn’t all that bad, I’ve driven in LA, Japan and been in crazy traffic in Delhi!

3. School culture - what can I expect? I’m really laid back, and love to meet people— are people friendly? 

Best part of my school was my classmates and my professors. Everyone was so welcoming and supportive. So this ended being an awesome place for me. 

4. On campus or off campus housing? Was looking at the HU site for apartments, they are expensive. I also don’t want roommates or to stay in a dorm - I’m an older student who has had my share of that! 

I did not have a place to stay literally until about two weeks before I came out here. My window for the HUH lottery was the end of May and so nothing was available! There was an early window open in April, but I believe you had to sign a lease that started almost immediately and pay upfront. 

I’m lucky in certain ways, not the hitting the lotto lucky but luck with conditions— about two weeks before coming out, I checked the HUH website and there were two units available. One quickly disappeared and so I just selected the one that was left. 

It was a furnished studio and I’m so happy that it worked out for me. It’s quiet and next to the river. 

5. Elitism — how will I fit in as a middle/low income teacher? Are there Walmarts around? Lol

This was barely noticeable. My cohort were down to earth but some came from wealth. Didn’t matter at all. And I found my people at Walmart haha.

6. Best places to visit around Boston or to eat. My fam will probably come at some point would like to recommendations to get true east coast experience. 

Best experiences were the feast days at north end. Lots of places to eat around here as well. My family didn’t come out however. Haven’t had lobster roll yet :( or seafood for that matter. 

7. Down time— how much down time should I expect as a grad student? 

For my program August term was jam packed, but manageable. Fall term I took 19 credit hours. It was also manageable for me (it’s dependent on the courses you take) - had classes m-th so weekend was time to relax. 

Spring term I took just 12. And only had classes on Tuesday and Wednesday. Lots of downtime! Again course dependent- I had a lot of projects I was working on though. 

8. Any other tips or advice! Thanks!

One thing weird is I got a grad meal plan thinking I would be able to use it starting August term— but it didn’t start till September. I had some food insecurity the first weeks of August. The receptions and such helped. My school finally is starting a food pantry for students - and I donated food because I went through that experience. 

I think my advice to my past self would be to not worry so much about fitting in, enjoy the short time at Harvard, make good connections and be yourself!",1,972,37.44,1.73,99,77.5,11.85,15.95,91.26,72.33,56.07,12.55,9.47,8.74,0.1,0.31,0,0.21,3.09,12.65,5.45,2.26,13.99,9.67,7.2,8.95,1.85,18.21,7.41,5.14,3.09,1.34,1.13,0.62,12.45,0.72,11.42,2.06,1.34,1.65,2.88,0.21,4.63,0,6.48,5.04,1.34,2.57,1.44,1.03,0.51,0,0.21,0,5.14,2.57,1.23,0.51,0,0.1,0.51,2.37,0.41,0.21,0.31,0,0.93,0,0,0.93,4.94,0.21,1.13,2.57,1.13,0,1.03,0.1,0,0,0.1,0,0,0.82,0,0.31,0.51,1.95,0.51,0,0.1,0.21,0.51,0.21,7.41,11.83,0.1,2.67,8.95,0.1,0.1,0.82,6.28,8.23,3.19,0.93,0.93,0.82,0.1,0.21,0,17.49,6.28,3.7,0.93,1.65,2.57,2.37,0

I seem to doubt that the views of, say Henry Dunster (President of Harvard from 1640-1654) would be tolerable in the areas of racial justice or women's rights.

Students have been trying to force the Hopkins administration to implement a university-wide program that will prevent sexual violence at primarily Greek-held events— perhaps by having sober monitors drug test drinks on students’ behalf, or by having drinks distributed by a third party.

You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

Read here. By now I'm sure you're all aware that classes after spring break will be held virtually. ""But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?"" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&adults=1&check_in=2020-04-22&check_out=2020-04-30&source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

Good luck and good health to you all. I'll see online you from my island in the Maldives that I'll be avoiding the rest of you from. Make sure to wash your hands before you eat those McChickens, and only cough on the Yalies.",1,554,50.41,95.83,48.19,35.6,20.52,18.41,88.27,70.22,57.22,16.61,11.01,1.44,0,8.12,0,1.44,5.6,15.88,5.96,1.08,16.79,9.93,5.96,4.87,1.81,17.15,6.86,3.25,2.89,0.18,0.9,1.81,11.01,1.26,9.75,1.99,1.26,0.9,1.99,0.54,2.53,0.72,3.25,2.17,1.08,1.81,1.08,0.72,0.36,0,0,0,12.45,1.44,0,0,0,0,0.36,10.83,0.18,0.54,0,0,1.99,0,0,1.99,5.42,0.36,0.54,3.25,1.26,0,2.35,0.9,0.36,0,0,0,0,0.36,0,0.54,0.36,0.54,0.54,0.36,0,0.18,0.72,0,5.96,11.91,1.62,1.44,6.14,2.71,0.18,0.54,5.23,1.62,5.05,4.33,0,0,0,0,0,16.97,4.69,3.25,0.36,0,4.15,4.51,0

With the onslaught of celebratory grad school, commencement, and internship posts on Facebook, I thought I would throw a glitch in the matrix and share my story: I was rejected from every summer internship that I applied to. It's the (supposedly) all-important junior summer, and I have nothing to do. But to be honest, I'm kind of okay with it. 

I think rejection stories are extremely important to share. I don't think we hear about them at Harvard as much as we should, but there's beauty in vulnerability. I started applying to summer internships several months ago. I even made it to the third round of interviews at my dream internship, and the company didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I was rejected. I had to ask them. After the onslaught of rejection letters sent to my inbox, I even began applying to random, mostly unpaid internships I found on Indeed, and I didn't get those either. I even applied to sell books at Barnes & Noble and I didn't get that too! And that was supposed to be Plan C.

But I want people to know that it's okay to get rejected. It totally happens. Rejection is not a reflection of your qualifications and self-worth. I do believe there's beauty in doing nothing, and I'm going to spend the summer entertaining myself and achieving my personal goals. I have every intention of sitting on my behind and watching 19+ seasons of Million Dollar Listing. I also want to get in shape and finally read the books on my bucket list that I haven't been able to because of schoolwork. Every time you get rejected from something, you can focus on something that you chose to do and what's truly meaningful to you. I like to think of it this way: I don't have to slave over a task delegated to me by a superior. This summer, I'm charting my own path.

My family is pretty upset about all the nothing I'm doing, and I'm not really sure how to address that. They have high expectations. But I have to say, I'm semi-happy with how my summer is going. Sure, it's cool that my peers are doing internships at Facebook, Google, and L'Oréal. But I also think it's really important to cast rejection in a positive light. You own the time that you've been given. You're free to define the hours as you see fit. I hate waking up at the crack of dawn, and now I can spend my time sleeping until the early afternoon. I hate commuting, and I've gained back three hours of time I would've spent commuting roundtrip. 

I don't really know how to conclude this post, but I just wanted to share that rejection happens to Harvard students and it's totally okay: cast that rejection in a positive light.",1,488,22.71,3.66,87.98,13.62,15.74,18.03,92.21,75.41,60.45,19.47,13.93,11.07,0.41,1.84,0,0.61,5.53,11.89,4.1,0.82,15.37,11.07,6.15,6.76,2.46,21.11,4.92,2.87,7.58,1.23,1.64,4.92,15.16,1.64,13.52,4.1,1.23,2.05,2.66,2.25,2.87,0,5.53,2.46,3.07,1.02,0.41,0.61,0,0.41,0.2,0,8.81,4.71,0.2,0.2,2.25,0.2,1.23,3.89,0,0,0,0,0.41,0,0,0.41,5.74,0.41,0,4.3,1.02,0,0.2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.82,0.61,1.43,0.41,0,0,0.41,0,0,6.76,6.15,0.41,1.02,3.48,1.02,0.2,0.2,4.1,4.71,5.74,1.84,0.61,0,0.61,0,0,18.24,6.15,4.3,0,0.2,5.33,2.25,0

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

Cambridge has plenty of parks and family spots...a campus shouldn't be that 'place' during a pandemic.

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance. I've had children come up to where I'm working and start yelling to each other even though I'm 50 yards (at least) from the nearest person and any usual tourist object of interest. I've been bumped into by tourists walking into me from behind me.

I've had visitors get right up on me because they think it's an ideal selfie spot.

People who are not students are hanging around and getting way too close no matter where you are.

Yesterday, I saw a woman let her child **urinate** on the grass in the middle of the Old Yard. Where people (like me) sit and study.

In short - students have a reason to be here - you (random families, tourists, locals who consider Harvard a 'park') **do not**. Not during this semester, I mean.

It's a logistical nightmare and just more stressful. Whereas before the virus you might have had a weekly homework/problem set/ reading assignment, now 4 of my 5 classes assign work to be done throughout the week, it's not more difficult to do, but just more difficult to organize.

Nope, with the pandemic, we're expected to make comments on reading by Saturday night, respond to our peers' comments by Sunday night and do like 3 separate video responses.

Some facts:

&#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

&#x200B;

The most important is #6 as that is an incorrect explanation seen around here a lot.

Two years ago. I applied early action, never expected to get in, but when I did, I then immediately accepted my offer - because it's Harvard. I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action. Maybe I'm desperate to not be completely miserable, but can someone give me a reason as to why Harvard is the right choice over these other schools?

While students at other institutions may spend their time thinking about their grades, future careers, or their LinkedIn, Harvard students have a unique set of problems they face: **How to complete the three traditions as quickly as possible.**


No, going as a Yalie for your first Halloween in Cambridge isn't a tradition, but looking around you'll be led to believe it is. The three traditions I'm talking about, of course, are having sex in the stacks, peeing on John Harvard, and participating in the Primal Scream. While STEM concentrations may think they're too busy to do any of this, or that people couldn't *actually* be having sex in Widener, us social science concentrations are well aware of the social pressures put onto every student here to partake in these traditions prior to graduating.

If you're determined, any dedicated Harvard student can complete the trifecta of traditions in less than 10 minutes. Luckily, since typically [65% of the matriculating class are virgins,](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/harvards-class-2017-full-virgins-and-thats-okay/311342/) none of you should have any problem completing **step one: having sex in the stacks** in a matter of minutes. The hardest part of this is agreeing on which section to practice procreation in. While Greek Philosophy is a popular one, I typically choose the *Love Languages* section, just to set the mood a bit.

Once you've completed the first task and left Widener, you should have about 7 minutes left, which is more than enough time to get over to the John Harvard statue. This step is arguably the most important, as **step two: peeing on John Harvard** doesn't only serve to complete the tradition, but is an important measure to take in order to prevent UTIs. Depending on the equipment of your partner you may have to give them a lift, or help each other up, but synchronizing streams, while not necessary, is certainly preferred.

Conveniently, this act can be used to kill two birds with one stone, and **step three: the Primal Scream** is generally an involuntary reaction to the burning sensation you feel while peeing on John after having sex with a stranger in the stacks. Be sure to make it a good one, this is your moment. Everyone's eyes are on you, people are leaning out of Thayer to cheer you on, and they want to hear a walloping, unadulterated scream. Similar to step two, this is a good opportunity to team up with your partner and harmonize a bit. Give the Krokodiloes a run for their money.

After dismounting from the statue, you should have just under a minute left, which is just enough time for the two of you to decide which of you is running to the HEM, and which to Malkin, for you both to shower the shame off. Shake dry hands, congratulate each other, and begin sprinting your separate ways into the night.",1,482,83.07,66.85,59.91,52.26,26.78,20.75,89,68.46,58.51,9.54,6.02,0.41,0.21,3.73,0,1.66,3.53,18.88,8.71,3.94,17.84,9.75,4.15,5.81,1.24,15.15,4.98,6.85,3.94,2.49,0.62,0.83,14.52,0.83,13.49,2.49,1.45,1.66,3.11,0.83,4.77,0,3.11,2.49,0.41,1.45,1.04,0.21,0,0,0,0,11,3.53,1.24,0.83,0.41,0.21,0.21,7.05,0,0,0,0,0.41,0,0.21,0.21,2.9,0,0.21,2.49,0.21,0,3.32,0,0,0,0,0,1.24,0,0.21,0.62,0.21,0.41,0,1.24,0,0.21,0.41,0.21,5.19,11,0.21,3.11,5.81,0.62,1.04,0.41,4.56,1.04,5.6,1.66,0,0,0,0,0,19.5,3.73,7.68,0.21,0,1.87,6.02,0

But this doesn’t mean we can’t donate a gate, we just have to smart about it! If we start saving now we can have enough for our own little tiny gate—think a doggy door. 

A doggy door gate is cheaper, makes the yard more accessible to dogs, and is just funny. 

For an added bonus we can tell tourist if their kid manages to crawls through the gate they get an increased chance of being admitted.

Most of the posts are Harvard parents talking about how great their own children are. They talk about all of the good grades and awards they receive. Do they not realize that all the students at the school are accomplished? In the parents class of 2020 page, there are lots of graduation things being posted lately. I saw a post of a HUGE banner that the parents hung over their garage with the picture of the graduate and their name and everything for the neighborhood to see.

I understand that maybe some of these parents don’t have another outlet to share the good news (especially due to COVID), but I find most of it to be very off putting. My mom mostly shares news with my grandparents or occasionally her friends, not other Harvard parents. Perhaps that is exactly the point of these Harvard parents groups and I am just not into that sort of stuff. I guess they are proud of their kids and want to share it with some like-minded parents? To each their own.

Just wondering how other people perceive this sort of stuff? Do you like it? Or not care at all?

In truth, MAT 157 is the most difficult of such courses, delving into topics generally not covered by even the most experienced of Real Analysts. 

&#x200B;

In the first week, we cover Horseshoe Analysis, showing that even the most insane integrals can be shown to be true with a simple symbological statement. Horseshoe functions are integrable in real space. Currently, we are exploring applications of Horseshoe Induction in the Riemann Hypothesis over finite vector ring spaces. Our class, which began with 250 people, currently hosts 25 attendees, 10 of which who are currently viewing the material from the local psych ward. Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of proving the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) over finite fields in real space. The only prerequisite of this course is High School Calculus, with recommended courses in Latin and Greek Philosophy. All students are required to attend seminars ranging from 5 hours to 11 hours a day in which students discuss Richard and Mortimer and the metaphysical implications of the topics discussed.

Less than 1% of extension students even obtain a degree from HES. It devalues our diploma when the public thinks we took a few online courses.

Columbia changed theirs to Professional Studies and it worked out great for them.

I haven't seen many reviews  online and thought it would be good for anyone considering the program to learn about my experiences before they get involved. Of course this is my opinion and others may disagree.

The Technology, Innovation and Education program is a one year master of education degree that overall specializes in the application of technology into education. You are required to take 5 classes that fulfill TIE credits and can use the remaining credits anywhere on campus or via cross registration at other schools. The TIE credit classes at the School of Education are meant to be applicable to many different careers whether they be designing educational programs, developing new education products, starting a business in education, bringing more technology into the classroom etc. You can find most of this information online and I wanted to share some of the pros and cons of the program here.

Pros:

1. Hands down the best part of the program is the cohort of other students you work with. Our cohort was about 70 people who represented lots of different backgrounds. Off the top of my head there were successful entrepreneurs, classroom teachers, programmers, business consultants, political activists, project managers, medical professionals and more. There were not a lot of people straight out of undergrad and the majority had some kind of education related experience. All of them were very inspiring, really personable and I felt really honored to be with them.
2. Being on the Harvard campus is incredible. You are open to just about everything going on at all the schools on campus and I felt it was really easy to meet people across many different programs through extracurriculars and other activities. MIT and Tufts are open to you as well if you feel like heading to another campus! Lots of competitions, classes, talks, meet ups, sporting events and that's not even considering the other things Boston offers.
3. The faculty are great. I really liked my adviser and the professors at HGSE. Across the other campus schools people are really responsive to meet as well. So long as you're a student on campus you have access to just about anyone.

Cons

1. One year is really, really short. If you are looking to enter the education industry but are not sure of the kind of role you are looking for your job search at the end might be difficult. Two semesters really isn't long enough to develop a solid set of new skills or to try out a lot of new things in the process. If you have a very clear vision (i.e. I want to start a company or I want to transition to a project manager in education) you will absolutely have the resources available to at least learn enough to secure an entry level role somewhere perhaps with the help of an adviser or professor. The classes alone aren't a feeder into any particular role and you will need to guide all of this yourself. In my opinion, the classes weren't particularly rigorous especially when compared with the core curriculum at some of the other graduate schools.
2. The career service office is completely overloaded and are not a lot of help. I don't know of anyone that took a job from the internal job board and the coaching sessions there are limited to 20 minutes at a time. The job fairs/employment seminars were honestly a little disappointing as some of the more well known education players either weren't present, weren't hiring at the event or clearly weren't serous about recruiting there (the scholastic people didn't even bring paper to write down interested candidates information!). Also the bigger companies that visited campus such as Microsoft made clear that they would not be accepting resumes and were only there to share their experiences in education. There are career resources present at HGSE through unofficial channels like advisers, colleagues, seminars and professors but don't expect the school itself to present many opportunities.
3. Alumni support is not as good as other graduate schools on campus. You can join the Harvard alumni network however there isn't really much in terms of alumni meet ups/reunions that the other graduate schools on campus have. 
4. As everyone already know the price tag is steep. Living in Boston is much more expensive than it used to be as well.

My Recommendations

I think this program is best suited for the following kinds of people:

1. You can get some kind of scholarship and get a leg up in classroom teaching opportunities. I personally don't think that the price of the program justifies the amount of ""leg up"" you get in teaching.
2. You are serious about starting a business in education and want to make use of all the entrepreneurship resources there.
3. Your company/school/organization will pay for this somehow or you will work in your original employer with some sort of bonus at the end of the program. 9 months is possible for some employers to work with and you can do the program part time over 2 years however I don't think there are many spots available for this.
4. You have a very defined transition into another career. Your first semester will be spent figuring out life at Harvard and your second semester will be all about finding a job. There is not a lot of time to test things out and see what you like. This is quite similar to other students I spoke to at MIT and the Kennedy school doing one year programs as you really don't have enough time to experience things like at 4 years of undergrad. Decide what you want to do in October at the latest and get as many skills and contacts in that industry/company as possible.
5. You already have a core skill i.e. programming, data analysis, financial modeling, graphic design etc. and want to transition into education. You can gain credibility in education within two semesters but don't have the time to master a ""hard skill."" The technology classes there coupled with a lot of outside resources can help but it will be a very busy year for you and will sacrifice a lot of the ""Harvard experience"" to do this. The motto on campus is that your fifth class every semester is ""Harvard"" due to the amount of activity on campus throughout the year.
6. The students who found work afterwards were typically doing roles such as curriculum designer, learning designer, community partnerships manager, non profit coordinators, education researchers and teachers. A few people went back to their original jobs in some form and a quite a few others are still looking for work a few months after graduation. 

Ultimately the consensus I've seen from alumni and colleagues is that it is a really enjoyable experience but may not be the most effective use of time and money unless you fit the above categories. Like many other roles in this day and age if you are really passionate about entering a certain profession there are many other ways of doing it rather than getting another degree.

Just my two cents and hope that the incoming class are ready for a fun year!",1,1246,76.24,42.89,41.49,63.2,18.32,23.35,92.13,68.38,56.9,8.83,5.3,1.69,0.08,2.81,0,0.56,3.53,16.85,7.95,2.25,16.05,8.59,5.7,6.18,1.85,14.69,7.46,7.7,4.01,1.04,2.25,0.8,15.01,0.72,13.8,2.73,0.56,1.52,2.81,1.52,5.38,0,3.29,2.97,0.24,0.64,0.48,0.08,0,0,0.08,0,9.47,2.57,0.48,0.08,0.08,0.08,0.4,6.5,0,0,0,0,0.88,0.16,0,0.72,14.29,0.16,0,13.24,1.28,0,0.56,0.08,0,0,0,0,0,0.08,0,0.16,0.64,0.8,0.32,0.4,0,0.48,0.08,0.88,6.42,7.22,0.48,0.72,5.3,0.8,0,0.32,2.65,2.65,4.57,1.2,0.08,0,0.08,0,0,11.24,5.62,2.33,0,0.24,1.52,1.52,0

I am updating the automoderator in response to some suggestions regarding Rule 1 violations. Thank you for the input! We should hopefully be seeing fewer blatant rule 1 violations from now on.


---

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

Removed | Not Removed
---|---
[Exhibit A](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bjbaqy/about_to_be_a_graduate_from_hes_with_extension/) | [Exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/admddj/hes_what_time_are_grades_posted/) 
[Exhibit B](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/5ji6qb/can_i_tell_my_friends_i_go_to_harvard_if_its_hes/) | [Exhibit 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/aixskc/hes_alb_acronym_history/)
[Exhibit C](https://reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/4i9dj4/harvard_extension_schoolbad_rep/&ved=2ahUKEwi60_eju97qAhVJ5awKHUwKA1MQFjACegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw1jG4m3obD13F7ucQU3j9FV) | [Exhibit 3](https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/92d6t7/my_harvard_email_not_deleted_after_my_class_at/)

I hope the distinction is clear from these examples. If not, feel free to comment below and I'll try to explain further. 

---

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

I want to eventually study for a PhD in math but I have a couple of questions, if I may? 


First, obviously Math 55 catches my attention and I would like to take it but I wonder if it might be too overwhelming for my first year. Does anyone have any insight into the workload for that class? If I am eventually going to be introduced to, in other math classes, all of the topics covered in this one class, I don't see it as beneficial to me to suffer through an accelerated class that throws it all at me at once. Can I learn all the topics covered in Math 55 through other math courses at Harvard spread across my undergraduate curriculum?


Second, is it common for undergraduate math students to remain at Harvard for their PhD studies as well? I am very interested in the work of one of the professors at Harvard on computational number theory. I was thinking I would like to study under him for my future PhD.

I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester.

Details in post. Here’s the abstract:

>	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean’s interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one’s surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

>	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission… And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn’t really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

I’m curious to know what successful (or unsuccessful) outcomes came as a result of graduating with an HES degree. A lot of time is spent discussing the value / education / legitimacy, but I don’t see as much content around what people end up doing with the degree itself. 

- Did the degree enable you to start your own company? 
- Did it prepare you got graduate school (PhD/Doctorate)? 
- Did it help with a career switch or promotion?

I'm curious to hear how Harvard alumni have chosen to maintain a relationship with Harvard after graduation, and what you've found most rewarding. Personally, I've wanted to maintain some type of connection, but life as an adult gets busy and complicated, and I often find that it gets bumped lower on the list of life's priorities.  I did alumni interviewing for some years, and found it rewarding to help out and to represent Harvard to applicants.  When I was back in the area, I reached out to a few student groups and did a few talks about the premed process.  I went to a few groups' meetings, but didn't keep that up.  I've been somewhat wary of official alumni association things, as my family's experiences with respect to spam, etc. has not been good.


I've thought about reaching out again to undergrads to pay forward some experience and see how I can help--even perhaps inconsequential stuff like bringing some people on a a Costco run for their suitemates--or informal advising, but am not sure how much anyone would want that kind of assistance or interaction.

Welcome home. Some important advice from Drew Faust Delivered by President Faust at last year's convocation address:

>Many of the most important ideas you will encounter over the next four years will not come from a professor or a lab or a book or an online assignment. They will come from those sitting next to you right now. Many of the questions you come to ask, the challenges you learn to parry, the new perspectives you come to embrace will be the result of your interactions with one another. This is why it is imperative that your class collectively represent the widest possible range of backgrounds, and experiences, and interests, the broadest diversity of geographic origins, socioeconomic circumstances, ethnicity, race, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, political perspective. It is possible, in 2017, to accumulate enough information and pass enough tests through online learning to get a college degree. But we have asked all of you to uproot your lives, move to Massachusetts with carloads filled with paraphernalia and teary-eyed families forced to bid you good-bye. Why do we do this? We do it because we believe in the power of community as an essential educational force. But that community must be constituted so that it does not simply present you with what you already know or with people whose life experiences and outlooks are just like yours. It is its diversity, its elements of unfamiliarity, its elements of difference that render Harvard College the extraordinary experience that I know you will find it to be. We are excited to welcome you, Class of 2021, because you are in yourselves a great educational machine — destined to teach one another — and, of course, teach us as well — because of the variety of who you are and what you bring. When the admissions office decided on you, it was because they wanted your voice, your contribution as part of this creative cacophony. So don’t be silent. (And please don’t live your life online as if you weren’t here at all!) Engage with one another. Talk a lot so others can learn from you. Listen even more so that you can learn from them. Don’t be afraid to take the risk of being wrong. Don’t be afraid to admit you are wrong. It is the best way to learn and grow. And listen generously to others so that they may take risks too. Use the community of your fellow students as one of the greatest gifts and opportunities of your time here.

A friend of mine had a class with a public figures child (X). When X checked its (pronoun replacement) grades in class, classmates noticed it wasn’t a good report, even w the stupid inflation, that’s another story lol. So the next time X checked her grades they tried “exposing” the grades on social media.

Personally, I'm really going to miss events such as *Crimson Jam*, the student-only night at the Harvard Art Museum, various clubs, random events that pop up each semester on bulletin boards around campus and even picking up a copy of The Crimson (should I see one).

I'll definitely miss being able to study in Widener. That place has been a haven for my ability to focus - I'm so much more capable of working in there since it's so quiet and I have less distractions than home. That and it's a a gorgeous building. 

I also have little spots on campus I like to just sit at and read/study. The nook in the top of Sever's Film Library was amazing for that, as was parts of the Science Center.

To graduate from this esteemed school you still need to fulfill every hist&lit kids worst nightmare, the QRD. But fear not, I have compiled a list of the easiest classes to skate through this distributional requirement.

&#x200B;

5. Econ 50:

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley. 

4. Math 21b 

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors––big whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that. 

2. Math 23a

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

1.Math 55a 

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups. 

Some people claim this is the hardest math class in the country, but thats mostly hype so people dont figure out how easy this class is. I hear 100% of the 10% of kids who don't drop the class, get A's, so you are basically 100% guaranteed to get an A!
