1. As a school as small as Williams, is it even available? If it is, how costly is it? I know that it says health *insurance* is covered under my scholarship, but I'm not sure how extensive that would actually be.
2. I also read on the website somewhere that the student care centre (or whatever it's called idk) is closed during the summer. I would assume that this means that care is both on campus and that it is not available during the summer, so would that effectively mean that care is not provided during the summer or that it is simply used for outside services instead of simply the on-site location.

If anyone on this sub knows or knows a resource where I can found out in more detail how this works kind of in advance I would appreciate it.

3 Jobs through the YMCA to support my Family and be involved in the community (Camp Counselor, Child Watch Assistant, and After School Care provider) 

Youth Ambassador for the NYS Youth Mental Health Advisory Board where I advocate, research, and campaign for youth mental health which has resulted in me writing and contributing towards bills set to pass in NYS regarding mental health in education and schools (My state Senator who runs the board went to Williams and offered to write me a Rec Letter for Williams, she‚Äôs awesome)

President of a School Teaching Club where I teach students how to design curriculums, organize and shadow teachers for classroom experience, meet with school officials at other districts, organize school supplies drives for low income students (I don‚Äôt know how much $ we raise in supplies but we get a lot), earned the club a program with Nazareth University for teaching, etc.

Advisory of a Military History Club where me and a teacher organize and design interactive Risk like battle simulation board games for members to learn about Military History and Strategy through fun ways

I did Rowing for 2 years (would do club if possible)

I have a Animation portfolio that has earned a few school art awards and a spot in the RIT Start Here exhibition

Member of Red Cross Club, Pre Med Club, GSA, etc. (probably some other stuff I‚Äôm forgetting)

TL;DR: what should I do based off of my stats if I don‚Äôt match for Questbridge. Should I ED to Williams, Hamilton, RD or something else? Do I go Test Optional? Am I decent enough to have a shot at Williams? Any advice at all would be Incredible

I‚Äôm currently a high school senior and plan to major in pure math with the goal of eventually pursuing a PhD. Since I‚Äôve maxed out my high school math courses, I‚Äôm currently taking linear algebra and abstract algebra at a nearby university.

I‚Äôm mainly focusing on applying to R1 universities (for Fall 2025) that offer opportunities to take graduate-level courses and explore various advanced math topics.

I‚Äôve heard great things about studying math at Williams College, but I still have a few unresolved questions. If you are (or were) a pure math major at Williams, I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights.

Here are a few things I‚Äôve learned from reaching out to faculty (in plain text), but I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences (my questions are in bold text):

1. Williams offers 400-level (also known as senior seminar) courses that are similar to graduate classes. These courses change every semester, ensuring that students always have access to upper-level classes. **What was your experience taking 400-level courses as an undergraduate? Were you able to explore different areas of math? Were there enough class offerings?**
2. Williams provides opportunities to conduct original research with faculty, which can lead to publications. **Have you written any papers that were published with a reputable organization (as an undergraduate)?**
3. Research opportunities and thesis work are primarily available through Williams‚Äô summer program (SMALL). **I understand that students from other colleges also participate in SMALL. Does Williams reserve a certain number of spots for its own students? What was your experience with the SMALL program?**

I also would like to mention that I prefer attending classes with other students so that we can exchange ideas. For now, I‚Äôm not particularly interested in pursuing independent study to self-learn a math topic.

Lastly, when I toured Williams in February 2024, we passed through a building where math classes were being held (I can‚Äôt remember the name). What struck me as odd was that most of the classrooms were empty, and the two classes that were in session had only about six students each. Is this typical?",

1) I'm worried about the small size of the school - I attend a high school (<100 per grade), and feel incredibly stifled by the size. I understand that, obviously 100 -> 500 is a big jump, so it totally may not apply, but if anyone who is a current student can speak to that please let me know! Especially given the rural location

2) I'm lowkey worried that everyone is so locked in to studying that the social scene is not very good - I'm not a big partier, but also would like to have some fun/not spend my weekends studying the whole time - do I need to worry about this?

3) From what I've read, the perception of Williams is kind of a jock-y culture. While I'm not very into sports, I am fairly outdoorsy - I guess I'm just wondering if not being into sports would be a detriment to my experience?

4) As someone who is fairly awkward, is it difficult to make friends at Williams? Obviously it'll depend from individual to individual, but is there a lot of cliqueyness or weirdness?

  
Thanks so much :)",

I said, thinking nervously about my son's chances of admission. The guy seemed a little surprised that a stranger in Texas would know where Williams is, no less what kind of curriculum it has. We talked for a bit about that, talked about how it's often mistaken for William and Mary, and then the show began. I never got that guy's name.

At the time, this was mid-March, before college decisions had come out. Fast forward two weeks, and lo, my son got in! He'll be attending in the fall.

I was admitted into Williams for the upcoming fall semester and now that I'm actively considering it (and leaning towards attending), I'm kind of stressing myself out over a slip in grades I had last semester. To cut to the chase, I went from straight As every other semester of school to this last year with 3 As, 3 Bs, and 1 C; my final GPA for that semester was a 4.3. My schedule was as tough as I could get it and I struggled a bit with that; my As were in AP Psych + Calc BC and dual enrollment civics, my Bs in AP Macro/Micro/Bio, and my C in AP Phys C E&M. I don't think those are unreasonably bad grades for those classes and especially given my circumstances (I do these classes virtually through my school because we don't offer them in person) but I am worried about the possibility of my acceptance being revoked because of the grade slip. I know it wasn't that big of a drop---from everything I've read, it sounds like I'll be alright because it wasn't in the grand scheme of things *that* drastic, but I'm still concerned. I never got a mid-year grades report submitted so that wasn't considered when I was admitted (my counselor sent them that today through Common App, and I've emailed admissions regarding the situation, still waiting to hear back from them on that). This semester's grades will be better, likely straight A's with maybe a B/C in physics.

Should I be worried? We're planning on visiting Williams this weekend and I don't want to make the 10 hour drive there only for it not to be an option. I know nobody here can likely answer this concretely but any perspectives on it would be nice while I wait for my answer to come in the email.

And, does anyone have any recommendations for things to do/see on campus or in Williamstown during a visit? :) Not entirely sure what else I can do other than walk the campus and try to get a feel for it all. Like I said, I live 10 hours away from Williams (in West Virginia) and so I want to make my trip count, both so as to have made it worthwhile and to soothe my anxiety about attending school somewhere so far from home.

Any advice would be appreciated greatly, sorry for the wall of text lol",

I will be going to the 12th grade in 6-7 months and I will apply early with the PG (Predicted Grade) which will be given depending on the results in the IB mock exams. I plan to apply to 8-10 universities. At the top of this list is Williams College. There are some reasons why I chose this place as my main target.

1- My sister is a graduate of Williams College Class of 2022 and I want to follow in her footsteps because I have identified her as a role model for myself.

2- They are very generous regarding Financial-Aid. This is a big plus since it is very difficult for a middle class family living in Turkey to pay 70-80 thousand dollars to a university every year.

3- I had the opportunity to visit the campus last summer. Both the campus and Williamstown were truly a wonderful environment. I think it will be worth spending 4 years of my university life.

4- Students are offered different opportunities that I have not seen in Turkish universities.

But what I want to learn today is the admission requirements. Of course, these are written on Williams' website, but I would like to learn more from accepted students. Thank you in advance and have a nice day :)",

I‚Äôve been admitted to McCombs at UT, and at Williams, I plan on majoring in Political Economy. Williams as a whole is great from what I‚Äôve read online and in the forums, but when I tell people that I‚Äôve been admitted to Williams, i receive blank faces. I have aspirations to attain a  JD-MBA at an T14 after undergraduate school, and I know Williams is excellent for that, but I don‚Äôt know much about UT‚Äôs placement into top law schools. I know UT isn‚Äôt flexible at all in terms of majors, and that is something I heavily dislike. I would also like any current students or alums input on whether or not the academic culture is cutthroat or collaborative. Please talk about other factors that you feel would be appropriate for my decision making, any and all input is very much appreciated.

I was recently admitted to Williams class of '28 as an international student. I didn't apply for any financial aid, and my middle-class parents‚Äîthey have an annual income of around $60,000, but savings in the hundred thousands and family property inherited somewhere in the future‚Äîare concerned that the investment of $350,000 is not worth because its unlikely for me to get a well-paying job after Williams as a non-US citizen. I'll have to do a masters, which, if its in law or an MBA, will likely cost $200,000 more.

They're also concerned that its a massive blunder for me to cloister myself in rural Massachusetts, among American elites, when the global centre of power is shifting rapidly from West to East.

Williams does not have global brand, so its unlikely for me to come back to my home country in Asia and get a good job solely based on William's prestige.

My other options are UCL ($188,000), UCSD ($300,000), and Ashoka University ($60,000).

Obviously, if money wasn't an object, I would run to Williams; it's the best fit for a person like me and I see my thriving intellectually and socially over there. However, that's not the only, or even the most important factor for me right now. What do you guys think?",

I am a rising in senior in HS looking to apply to Williams ED in a few days. I am a gay guy and would like to have at least some options when it comes to community/dating/hookups at college. I know that just because of how small the school is there will definitely be limited options, but I was hoping there would be at least somewhat of a pool (even if it's shallow.) Also, I was curious given the athletic culture how the queer community is generally treated. My questions are:

1. Is there a decent sized population of mlm and other queer guys?
2. How common are gay couples/emphasis on hookups or relationships? 
3. general treatment of gay men specifically?

Thanks for all these answers btw this thread is so helpful when it comes to looking at colleges I appreciate y'all.

1. do you think the career center is extremely effective at helping students prepare for interviews, write their medical school applications, etc.? like i've heard a lot about the support they give you but is it actually genuinely groundbreaking and extremely helpful?
2. in your opinion, do you think williams grade inflates, deflates, or neither? what are some common classes that are generally seen as ridiculously wayy too difficult? essentially, i kind of want to know how difficult it is to maintain straight As and A+s -- like what is the time commitment, basically? how many hours do you generally spend on homework? obviously this differs across major, level of class selection, and classes themselves (so would also be awesome if you could specify these in your answer!)
3. what does the social scene look like? how often do people party, are these parties enjoyable, etc. is it easy to make friends and are people generally down to like go out or like study sesh together etc.? what do people usually do for fun?
4. i've heard that williams' culture can be overly like white and preppy -- do you think this is true?
5. how competitive is the premed culture? do you think premed stuff gets at all cutthroat?
6. overall, why do you think premeds drop out? how many generally do? do more people drop out because they realize premed is too much work and it's not worth it, or because they realize they want to do something else, or because of really difficult classes or discouragement, or because they failed a premed requirement that they're not good at (like physics or smth)?
7. i've heard it's insanely easy to get research at williams -- very much as simple as talking to a prof after class -- but is there also good support for undergraduate students who want to conduct more high level research on their own with the help of a professor? like have students written their own papers and done their own research, the kind that gets published and wins awards yada yada
8. how well do people do with medical school applications? like how many people per year generally get into super top tier medical programs? do you know anyone who applied to and succeeded with applications to md-phd programs? (the dream fr)
9. how easy has it been for you to form meaningful relationships with professors and like actually talk to them one-on-one about academics, random stuff that doesn't really pertain to class, personal stuff, etc.?
10. are there competitive club applications?
11. random and maybe not so random cons of williams in your opinion? like what tiny things irk you? what big things irk you? especially what is the biggest annoyance of living in the middle of nowhere LOLL

I was accepted to Williams College in the RD round 2 weeks ago. I haven't committed yet, as I still have a couple of questions that I was hoping I could get answered. To preface, I'm a political science (and possibly economics double major) major interested in the law and or consulting.

Thank you for all of your help!

&#x200B;

1. Is it true that there's grade deflation at Williams? Even with local or east coast graduate schools or employers knowing that grade deflation is common, would it negatively affect my placement at jobs or schools in other regions (such as the west coast, etc)? Are Williams' opportunities limited to the Boston/ Northeast area?
2. Are there student gyms available to work out? I could find a few student organizations that allow you to borrow equipment, but are there any local or college gyms that I could go to regularly?
3. What are the chances of receiving a single room vs a double, given that I select my preference as ""single"" on the housing form? I've seen a couple of posts about selecting Mission vs. Frosh Quad. Is there one that's better than the other, or one that you would personally recommend (for making friends, etc)?
4. How easy is it to double major OR change majors? I read that 40% of all undergraduate students double major at Williams, but how much flexibility do students *really* have? I got accepted for Political Science but I'm considering adding Economics and pursuing consulting after college.
5. One of the biggest drawbacks for me is that Williams doesn't accept any AP scores or College Credits. I've taken (and will be taking) a total of \~15 AP tests with passing scores, and also another 10 college classes that would satisfy 75% of community college requirements in California. I could skip 1 to 1.5 years of CC requirements, but weighing that against a 4-year Williams education is rough... Has anyone else been in a similar situation before?
6. The feeling and sense of a community are super important to me. How active are the Debating Team or the South Asian Students' Association? I come from an Asian-dominated county, city, and school. I'm open to all demographics and realize that Williams contains an entirely different cultural dynamic. How active are associations like SASA, and how big does their membership tend to be? Are they smaller close-knit groups, or are they wider groups with their own friend groups and cliques?
7. One of the biggest pros about Williams is its huge alumni network and successes in job/ graduate school placements. Can anyone describe their experiences with the '68 Center for Career Exploration? What does the process look like? Does it involve emailing former students at Williams? Is this the same as the EphLink mentoring website? Also, since a large percentage of Williams alumni take jobs in Boston, are there alumni that help connect you with opportunities in the west coast or southeastern United States? (similar to #1)",

(TL;DR: Edexcel student here, have always been above average as a student and got all 9s in IGCSEs, but flunked my AS-level exams and ended up getting BCC, although, I believe that my true strengths bloom freely with my ECAs. Should I apply ED to Williams, my dream college, or just go for a safer option?)

I am from a LDC in South Asia, and I have received an Edexcel education ever since middle school. All throughout high school, I have been a decent student, ranking in the top single-digit percentage always. The hard work paid off as I got all 9s on my IGCSEs (otherwise, I got a 4.0 GPA in all of my courses for my sophomore year). However, owing to following an improper mode of hybrid education towards to end of 2021 and the first quarter of this year, my AS-level education was severely hit and I ended up getting BCC on my 3 subjects. In retrospect, it isn't the end of the world, as I am retaking a few papers and hoping to bounce back, but the sadness (and I only say this because I haven't been mentally evaluated to be clinically depressed) I suffered through this year has harshly impacted by mental health and wellbeing - which in turn affected my SAT score too.

I retook the SAT on Oct 1, and am expecting a 1450+ hopefully. However, my strengths get fully expressed through my ECAs. I am a Duke of Edinburgh Alum, having completed all the journeys and having received all three certifications. I was also in charge of handling the marketing for 2 F&B giants in my country, and during my tenure, we reached 10s of millions of people across the internet. Being an adept growth hacker, I co-founded (and am serving as the chief editor) a news platform which quickly became the biggest bite-sized media agency in my country, and which reached people in the metric of 100s of millions across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn. The success of our bite-sized media agency saw one of our competitors partnering up with us to come under an umbrella company - one that I am a majority stakeholder of, and that has recently been valued at $1.0 million in our seed round (however, we are aiming for a $1.5 million valuation currently). Besides, I have been part of my school's football club and MUN club since middle school, having won trophies and medals for my football team, and serving as the director general at my school's MUN conference. Moreover, I have also appeared on a soap opera on our national TV network, and have acted in multiple OVCs, apart from voicing several commercials and characters over the year. I have also served as an English tutor to a few juniors, over the years.

Williams College has almost been like an exotic dream for me ever since I was in the 8th grade, and learned that my cousins graduated from Bates, Wellesley, and Pomona, while one was soon going to start at W&L. I want to study Economics and Williams have always seemed to match all of my needs and wants from the institution I want as my alma mater.

The school size is relatively small (especially coming from a larger HS) and it doesn't seem like there's much to do off campus. Would you say it's easy to find people you like, maintain a social life, have some sort of balance? Does the campus feel overly isolating? Do you run out of things to do quickly?

I'm pretty outdoorsy, but there's only so much hiking I can do before I lose it.

I've really liked Williams since the very beginning (one of my very top choices for a variety of reasons, and also my parents love Williams). I want to fully do my research though before I commit anywhere, so I'd appreciate if people here could answer some of my questions! Thanks so much, I'm so so happy üòä

1. What's the 'tutorial based' academics like? What does this mean exactly? How has your experience been with this teaching style? 

2. What's the friendship scene like? Stratified groups? Everyone socializes with each other, and a few really close friends? Parties? (I'm not a big party person but like to try things out and meet people and have fun) Also- I really don't plan on joining a frat/sorority in college. 

I'm pretty extroverted, but mostly in the sense that I like to spend quality time with my friends or really get to know people. 

I'm not a super outdoorsy person either, which does kind of worry me for my fit to Williams. I like walks and stuff but hiking consistently would be too much for me. 

3. Are you liking the social life at Williams? I heard Williamstown is a hit or miss with people. I talked to a girl from UMich who hated Williams's campus/town and loved UMich's campus/city lol. I'm leaning towards liking a small school more, but I'm not completely sure that I want to be super far away from a city. I like going to cafes and restaurants and museums and stuff. 

4. I'm really confused as to whether I want to pursue medicine (psychiatry) or law. Is Williams a good place to explore both and decide on one path in people's personal experiences? And then how are people doing with law/medicine internships, law/med school admissions, research, etc.? 

5. Does Williams have grade inflation or deflation? 

Lastly for now 6. What's the mental health of the student body like? 
I'm currently a dual enrolled high school senior at a local university with a ~60% acceptance rate. Freshmen here have disappointedly told me that this uni was their 'safety school,' even if I didn't ask at all and the uni is very good! (like... okay I don't know why I had to know that or what I can sayüò≠). Anyways, the overall mental health/student satisfaction here is pretty bad (5+ suicides this year of underclassmen) and the school spirit is medium-low I think. I don't think I could deal with this kind of environment somewhere else for 4 years. How does this environment compare with Williams's?",

I know several people who are considering transferring because of how toxic the work culture here is and how damaging it is to the mental wellbeing of the students. Somehow this school costs over 70k a year yet the counseling center and office of accessibility are understaffed.

Additionally, the administration has treats us like actual children. Yes, it is great that with COVID they ensured we did not have an outbreak. However, they put unnecessary measures in place that literally no one supports. For example, there was rumors that someone got roofied a few weeks ago and the school decided that we could only swipe in to our own dorms. And this was at all times. Just a major inconvenience that did 0 to help the situation. And now campus security is shutting down parties in dorms when they never did before, killing the already non existent nightlife here.

And this is not even to consider the additional stress if you are not rich, white, cis, and able bodied.

&#x200B;

I'm a rising high school senior that is applying to colleges this fall. I've narrowed down my ED schools to Williams and Dartmouth and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding between the two schools. I would appreciate any insight that students had that would help me decide. For reference, I will most likely want to study Economics and do something with math, whether that be either doing a double major or getting a minor in math. I will also be cross-posting this to both r/WilliamsCollege and r/dartmouth to get as much input as possible from current students or alumni.

&#x200B;

In terms of the quality of education, I have heard good things about both schools, especially in regards to their econ departments as they are very popular at both colleges. I think the math department at Williams is quite a bit stronger than Dartmouth's, though. Moreover, both schools say they're ""undergraduate-focused"" but I think this is more true of Williams where classes are smaller than Dartmouth and fewer students are competing for research positions and stuff like that especially in a major as popular as econ. Some Wiliams students I have talked to said they even chose Williams over HYPSM because of this and said that Williams has the best quality of education in the world. Does Dartmouth compare? Also, Williams has the Oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.

&#x200B;

The Alumni network also matters to me a lot since I am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. I've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. However, Dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from Dartmouth than Williams. While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in. I don't really know which is better, but I would say maybe Dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but I would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each school.

&#x200B;

This is kinda unique to Dartmouth but I don't know whether the D-Plan is on net good or bad. I've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. Sophomore summer and ""Camp Dartmouth"" sound cool too. I've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. I've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.

&#x200B;

In terms of the campuses, I, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either Williams or Dartmouth. Architecture and the ""look"" of a school matter to me a lot though. I really like the rural vibes of both the schools. If anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.

&#x200B;

In terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. However, the people at Williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at Dartmouth, which I've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what I've picked up from the vlogs I've watched and things I've heard. Williams concerns me a bit because I have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. However, Dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.

&#x200B;

That brings me to greek life. From what I have heard, Dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. I have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. I don't really think I would enjoy frats and I'm even more concerned since if admitted I will be on lots of financial aid so I don't know if I'll be able to afford to join one if I wanted to down the road. I have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. I'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I know this is really stupid, but the ivy league pReStIGe is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about Williams but most people know about Dartmouth. I am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but I was wondering if the Ivy League branding that comes with Dartmouth really matters in the future?

I would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between Williams and Dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school. Thank you in advance to all who reply!",

I understand that every application procedure is different and one cannot pin down what will get me in however it will be really helpful to me if I can get some feedback. So here are the changes I will bring:

1. will submit my SAT score
2. will submit my mid-year report
3. have done considerably more MUNs than last year
4. will submit a dance supplementary video
5. have been teaching this kid English for the past 3 weeks (intend to teach till Nov)
6. part of literature club and editorial club (have done some minor things but still pretty close to me)
7. working on a website
8. working on a research paper
9. (common app) Essay: I will bring some slight changes to the essay that I submitted last year
10. will be a certified yoga teacher so I guess that will come into play

&#x200B;

So far these are the changes that I will bring to my application. Will be a real help to me if you could provide your feedback on it.

Moreover, does this mean I'll get less money in my financial aid package on the small chance that I do get in?",

Williams College has become my dream school over the past few months and I was thinking of applying with ED. 

I'm an international IB student who didn't think of preparing for an American Uni until now, which means that I haven't thought of preparing for the SAT until now (I'm in Grade 11). When I took practice tests, my scores weren't very high to submit to the school (definitely not in the 25th percentile) and was delighted to hear that Williams went Test Optional for a few more years. 

But since it's not test blind, test scores are going to be considered for ones who put it in, and I'm torn between trying to prepare for the SAT while doing IB (which is already rigorous) or just taking my chances and focusing on my GPA. I did read somewhere that students who submit their scores had almost double the chance of getting in compared to those who don't have scores... which makes me a little nervous.  

Are there any (international) students who got accepted without submitting SAT/ACT scores in 2021? Any insight/comment/advice would be appreciated! Thank you so much!",

The Williams admission website says it's ""entirely"" optional to turn in the supplemental essays, but I actually doubt that. But, unlike Amherst, Williams lacks explanations for option 4, which is submitting an academic paper...? Also. ""in the last year"" means within the past 12 months, right?

Williams bills itself as a ""need blind"" school like many other highly selective US colleges. However, I heard from students at Columbia and Penn (other need blind selective colleges) that they and a lot of their classmates were advised to apply for aid **after** they received their acceptance letter. They claimed that these colleges were, in fact, not need blind in practice. A student who got in Penn ED waited until May to apply for financial aid, and a student at Columbia I know said that a lot of their class applied after their acceptance. All students mentioned were domestic, and I am a domestic applicant.

In fact, Ivy Coach wrote a [blog post about it](https://www.ivycoach.com/the-ivy-coach-blog/college-admissions/2-reasons-need-blind-admissions-farce/) where they called need blind admissions a ""farce,"" claiming that ""colleges are not need blind as they may suggest so freely to applicants and their parents. Now there are a couple schools that are straightforward ‚Äî they‚Äôre open and honest about being need aware. But all of those colleges that claim to be need blind, they too are need aware. They‚Äôre just not as honest about it."" as well as ""If a college actually did this, that college would not be able to sustain itself. It would have to dip into its endowment. Tuition is vital to highly selective colleges. It‚Äôs why tuition fees are so high. Schools would never make this error. They take need into consideration, even though they say just the opposite.""

Williams students who receive aid, is there really a disadvantage to applying for aid with your application? If so, can a student who gets in Early Decision apply for aid after acceptance? Will this impact the award in every way? 

Stay safe, y'all.",

I've already looked over all the biology professors and their research on the Williams website, but I'm wondering -- which ones will be most likely to take on freshmen? I have research experience from high school: I've worked with with fruit flies, CRISPR, genetics, Western blots, DNA gel electrophoresis, etc. It would be really  helpful if someone could point me in the right direction as to which professors to email about research, or whether or not I should do it at all.

Our county (understandably) had a lot of equity issues to address (some students don't have Wi-Fi in the home), so we're trying to figure out how Williams transitioned into distance learning.

I'm pretty much set on majoring biology with a concentration in neuroscience but I'm hoping to explore the Cog-Sci program too. I was accepted to a few other universities with more focused neuroscience programs, but Williams is a better fit for me (most colleges have amazing academic/social opportunities, but I know I'll thrive better as an Eph) and I appreciate the ability to pursue a liberal arts education. At Williams, neuroscience is only offered as a concentration and cog-sci as a program. There were less than 20 neuroscience courses, 4 of which are independent studies, and around 5 cog-sci courses, 3 of which are independent studies. I'm worried I might run out of courses to take or won't have enough neuroscience-related research opportunities to pursue, which is concerning because I'm hoping to go to grad school after graduation. If my primary interest is neuroscience and cog-sci, would it be better to go to a research university with a renowned neuroscience program, or do you think Williams has enough resources for me to receive an in-depth education and be a competitive applicant for neuroscience/cog-sci grad school programs?",
