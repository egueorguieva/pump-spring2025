jw291e,The Problems with BYU Contracted Housing,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jw291e/the_problems_with_byu_contracted_housing/,99,2020-11-17 21:43:23+00:00,ProdigalPressProvo,"This month our team has been doing some research on the BYU housing market, talking to academics, emailing local real estate brokers, digging through off-campus housing rules, and looking through business records. Everyone knows BYU housing has problems, but it’s time we have a real discussion about the root causes.

Here are a few excerpts from “The Provo Housing Racket” that summarize our findings pretty succinctly:

—

Too often, BYU students are over-charged, abused, and taken advantage of by their landlords. And, despite good intentions, BYU is one of the greatest culprits behind Provo’s broken student housing market.

BYU places significant hurdles in the way of would-be landlords, limiting the supply of available housing and costing students more. First, BYU contracted apartments are required to physically segregate male and female designated units. Since most apartments in the U.S. are gender-neutral by default, a large chunk of housing is written-off on that basis alone. Second, BYU contracted apartments must be located within a certain distance of campus, limiting the geography for BYU housing to a mere 2.7 square miles. That area includes established businesses and married housing, as well as streets and greenspace.

As a result, many BYU apartments are thirty, forty, even fifty years old. Building new is expensive, and the pool of non-BYU contracted housing within the zone is limited. Most newer developments are on the premium side of the market (The Village, College Place, etc.). If students had a wider range of affordable options to choose from, rent would fall and quality would rise.

It’s bad enough that BYU has built a system primed for exploitation—a system where the rules of supply and demand no longer apply, and landlords can count on a captive audience of vulnerable renters. What’s worse is the way that BYU has abandoned its responsibility to protect students. Last winter, BYU moved classes online and told students to go home. Students on-campus were released from their contracts in the dorms without penalties. Students off-campus, however, were left to fend for themselves. BYU did little to pressure complexes to release students from contracts, even though the university could have threatened to rescind BYU approval for non-compliant housing. 

If BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing with all of the drawbacks that entails—special rules, higher rents, lower quality—BYU needs to do more to protect students. This means:

No more 12-month contracts: require complexes to offer fall/winter contracts since most students leave Provo in April. 

No more monopolies: limit the reach of companies like Redstone Residential that exercise unfair control over the housing market.

Finally, pick sides: when crises like COVID-19 break out, BYU needs to side with students. The university has played neutral for far too long.

Or better yet, BYU should let students live where they want and let the problems work themselves out."

dapy7k,My experience as a transgender student with BYU's ID center,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/dapy7k/my_experience_as_a_transgender_student_with_byus/,29,2019-09-29 03:19:18+00:00,soapfestbeth,"Some background: I'm currently a senior attending BYU and discovered that I was trans over the summer (Male to Female). Since transferring isn't really an option for me, I plan on being more open with my gender identity at BYU, and I've already came out to my bishop and a number of professors. Everyone has been pretty supportive so far, which I was not expecting.

Anyway, I wanted to get my ID card updated to reflect my new name and gender presentation. I was a bit hesitant, since I've heard quite a few cautionary tales of LGBT students and the Honor Code Office. I ended up emailing the ID center to verify that what I was doing was kosher.

It turns out that the ID center was totally cool with putting my preferred name on my card and dressing in feminine clothing for my picture. The person I emailed even asked what pronouns I wanted used for me so that when I went in I wouldn't get misgendered. So that turned out really well. Getting the ID card updated was pretty easy too, I simply walked in, took the picture, got my card, and left no questions asked.

In summary, while BYU can still be a tricky place for LGBT students to navigate, things are getting much better for us on campus. If you're a transgender student on campus, you should definitely still weigh the pros and cons of coming out of the closet. I just want y'all to know that (in my experience) the ID center is pretty trans friendly."
em3vln,My experience meeting with an Associate Dean of Students about the beard policy,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/em3vln/my_experience_meeting_with_an_associate_dean_of/,19,2020-01-09 03:26:15+00:00,None,"Hey everyone, I'm a sophomore at BYU who thinks he looks way better with a beard, and my wife and friends agree. So I let my facial hair grow and shave before tests. I hate doing this, because I want to let my beard grow out, so a couple weeks ago I met with the Associate Dean of Students Nathan Ward to discuss the issue of beards.

A quick summary of our meeting: that sucks, there's nothing I or you can do, have an ice cream on us.

In all honesty, my meeting with Dean Ward was very cordial and respectful. I went in knowing that people would have spoken with him before and intended on getting some ideas on official ways I can go about appealing it to people in power. And that's where I hit a brick wall. While I got the feeling throughout the meeting that Dean Ward was on my side and in total agreement, he explained to me in no uncertain terms that there's no way for me to directly contact those in charge of the Dress and Grooming Standards.

He also explained to me who's in charge of them: the First Presidency, Twelve, and a handful of other commissioners who meet to talk about the entire CES once a month. He told me that they were aware of the issues and that they were aware that student sentiment had changed. I asked if he could bring it up, he said that while they do talk about student sentiment about many rules that not even President Worthen can make recommendations on changes to the Honor Code: only the board can ask for recommendations. ie the prophet, his counselors, and 3 or 4 other people. The last time they asked for recommendations? 1991.

I asked him if he could see the policy changing while I'm at BYU (two-ish more years), he said he wouldn't be surprised, but that I shouldn't hold my breath.

After 45 minutes of discussion, I said ""it appears we've hit a brick wall."" Dean Ward chuckled sympathetically, and as a well-intentioned final act of placation, gave me two coupons for free ice cream from Cougar Eats, which I enjoyed with my wife.

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah, we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County, particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We’re concerned not only for your well-being, but also for those in the local community who are affected by the trends we’ve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes, work, church, and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren’t wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you’re feeling sick, stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus, may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result, follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks, more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine, closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely,

Kevin J Worthen, BYU President
Astrid S. Tuminez, UVU President"

View Part 1 [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jw291e/the_problems_with_byu_contracted_housing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

In Part 1, we concluded that one of the biggest drivers behind BYU's broken student housing market is BYU itself. In Part 2, we will examine Redstone Residential and MHE Real Estate as a case study on the greater Provo student housing market. 

\_\_\_

Most students have no idea who their actual landlord is, and unmasking owners can be a lot like taking apart a Russian Nesting Doll—one shell company after another. Consider the Liberty franchise. According to Utah business records, the Liberty on Freedom complex is owned by Liberty on Freedom (LLC). In turn, Liberty on Freedom (LLC) is owned by Liberty Square West Investors (LLC) and Liberty Square West (LLC). Finally, Liberty Square West (LLC) is managed by **(name redacted to avoid doxxing)**, CEO of MHE Real Estate. A quick look through the MHE Real Estate [website](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/) reveals that MHE is a major player in the Provo housing market, despite the fact that the average renter has never even heard of them.

MHE at least partially owns: Campus Provo, Liberty Square, Liberty on Eighth, and Liberty on Freedom. These are among the largest BYU complexes by bed count. Liberty Square is actually the single largest BYU complex by bed count. 

While MHE owns the apartments, Redstone Residential (a real estate operating company) manages everything from leasing to maintenance and rent collections. In other words: Redstone is essentially a middleman between landlords and renters. Most operating companies take a percentage of revenues, driving up rent and disincentivizing any expensive maintenance or improvements. 

Residents we spoke to at Liberty on Freedom noted aged buildings, shared bedrooms, cramped kitchens, and a single shared bathroom. With utilities, rent comes out to about $400/month.

Before MHE and Redstone, Liberty Square had a vacancy rate of [30-40%](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/liberty-square/) during the summer months due to the nature of fall/winter and spring/summer length contracts. Now, Redstone-managed properties almost exclusively offer 12-month contracts, and vacancy has fallen to nearly zero. The burden has shifted from landlords to renters, and students are left scrambling to find replacement tenants for the summer months even though most BYU students leave Provo in April.

Redstone manages about half of all beds at the large BYU complexes and an even greater share of the overall market. Because BYU has kept the barrier to entry for new landlords so high, many students are forced to choose between one Redstone-managed property or another. And if it's not Redstone, it's likely Aspen Ridge. Small landlords are struggling to compete or even get BYU approval.

When COVID hit, the MHE-owned and Redstone-operated Liberty franchise was generally uncooperative with students trying to be released from their contracts or get rent reductions. Meanwhile, Redstone Residential received [between $2-5m](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/redstone-residential-inc-3cfaf714208b0bbd8de93d67b90a1a92) in forgivable PPP loans. 

When a few large firms monopolize a market, competition falls and consumers are made worse-off. Granting students access to the open market is the best way to promote competition and loosen the hold of companies like Redstone and MHE.

It's time for BYU to step-up and fix the broken housing market they helped create."

Pro-tip: This is not the first time groups of people with different standards have had conflict.  So what’s the best way to deal with conflict?  Generally, when there is deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement, it’s helpful to agree to disagree.  

By the way, “deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement” is exactly what this is.  This isn’t Handmaid’s-Tale-style patriarchy trying to oppress you, and it’s not a progressive conspiracy to make you gay.  It’s decent people who genuinely hold one set of values disagreeing with decent people who hold a different set of values.  For the most part.

I have many friends and acquaintances from across the political and social spectrum, and we agree to disagree a lot.  I don’t love the fact that abortions occur, but I have good friends who are one-issue pro-choice voters.  I don’t think Islam is the devil’s scourge, but I go to family reunions with plenty of people who do think that, and I love them dearly.  I think socialism is an atrocious idea, but I haven’t blocked any of my Bernie-loving friends on social media.  Why?  Because we agree to disagree.  We share our opinions, we exchange ideas, and when the day is over, we shake hands and go back to our corners.

By the way, letting the other side “go back to their corner” is an essential part of agreeing to disagree.  Even though I’m pro-life, I’ve never chased an abortion doctor back to his house and picketed his front door.  Because that’s his house.  Even though I’m anti-anti-Islam, I’ve never gone inside my cousin’s rural Baptist church and shouted that everyone needs to stop sending money to Israel and be more open-minded about Islam.  Because that’s their church.  Even though I’m pro-gun, I’ve never gone to a meeting of Moms Demand Action with a firearm slung on my shoulder.  Because that’s their meeting.  Agreeing to disagree means you listen quietly, you state your case, and then you respect the other side’s autonomy.

In summary --  Even if you think homosexuality is a bad idea, don’t go to a gay bar and preach at people.  Nobody forced you to go to the gay bar, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave the people in the gar bar alone.  The gar bar doesn’t exist for you.  And even if you think homosexuality is just fine, don’t go to BYU and protest.  Nobody forced you to go to BYU, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave BYU alone.  There are plenty of universities that don’t think there is anything at all wrong with homosexuality.  Like, ALL OF THEM except BYU.  

I’m NOT saying, “If you don’t like BYU's standards, go somewhere else.”  I’m saying, if you don’t like BYU’s stance on homosexuality, that’s fine!  Stay if you want to.  It’s fine that there are communities that you don’t like.  There are communities that I don’t like.  We don’t have to change everybody we disagree with.  Let BYU’s standards be BYU’s standards.

Respect the fact that different communities see things differently, and leave them alone to do things differently."
f4g1yn,If you were rejected from BYU today...,95,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/f4g1yn/if_you_were_rejected_from_byu_today/,14,2020-02-15 21:28:34+00:00,nikond750,"I was rejected from BYU just about two years ago. I was a convert with a 36 and a 4.0 and I was left feeling shocked and very hurt. I attended another university for a semester, reapplied with the exact same application, and was ultimately accepted for Winter 2019. 

College admissions is a really fickle process. I don't know why you were denied (and if my experience holds, you will never receive a reason...) but I do have a firm belief—bolstered in large part by my rejection experience—that God will aid us in making the best of these twists and bumps in our life plans. I'm sure I could be in a fantastic place in my life right now had I been accepted the first time, but I also know that my life would be drastically different without the attributes I refined as I weathered this ""trial,"" the amazing friends and faculty with whom I connected at my other university, and the people I met here at BYU only because I arrived when and how I did.

Unfollow BYU on Instagram for a few months if you have to, but keep doing all of the wonderful things you did in preparation to gain admittance and striving to be the best person you can be. Whether you wind up here in Provo next year or head elsewhere for higher education, I promise you're going to be okay. Feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to. :)"

Despite following all of BYU's mask and social distancing standards both on- and off-campus, I developed some COVID-like symptoms over the weekend. Per the instructions at [health.byu.edu](https://health.byu.edu) and on the Health Together app, I started self-isolating right away and I called the BYU COVID-19 hotline (801-310-0438). Since it was the weekend, they weren't open, so I left a message and received a call back first thing this morning.

You have to have an appointment to be tested at BYU. When they called me, they gave me several timeframe options during the day. You can either walk up or drive through. Masks are required. I walked since I don't have a car. When I was there this morning, it already seemed pretty busy with a few other people who walked up and 10-15 cars in line waiting to be tested. The whole process took me 5-10 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I left.

There is a tent at the front of the Student Health Center where you give them your name to check in. They took my temperature, and after waiting for a few minutes, one of the doctors administered the test. Yes, it involves sticking a q-tip type thing far up your nose, but at least for me, it wasn't painful and just tickled. They told me I should expect to get a phone call with the test results on Wednesday.

I'd imagine things will only get busier as the semester continues, so it's probably best to be proactive about getting tested even if you start experiencing even the slightest symptoms. I hope everybody stays safe!"

I was near the top of my class in high school without ever having to try to hard.
Now I’m a junior at BYU and feel like although I’m working harder than I did back in high school (let’s face it, high school was kind of a joke) I can’t seem to do nearly as well as my peers in any of my classes. You go from being one of the handful of smart kids in high school to being below average at BYU (I’ve got to stop checking the class grade stats on learning suite). Am I doing something wrong or is this a fairly common experience? I wish I could snap my fingers at just not care, but it’s not that easy."

I’ve been to multiple game nights, movie nights, etc. in the past few weeks at my complex, and even though they were all low key small group settings, I can’t help but think that it’s in these kinds of settings (where, let’s be honest, no one is wearing a mask) that COVID is spreading rampantly. 

Anyways, I’ve seen a lot of people share online President Worthen’s letter about COVID spread at BYU. From what I understood, even small group gatherings outside of class and church are discouraged. I’ve been invited to some small group social events this weekend, and I’m not sure how to approach my friends and say we shouldn’t even be getting together without sounding self righteous and dumb. 

Any advice? I hope that my experience has been an anomaly when it comes to frequent groups with no masks."

Theory: BYU told the professors to give everyone more hw under COVID precautions.

My guesses why: 

A) To make us feel like we are still getting our money's worth in spite of less in-person interaction.

B) To keep us stationary. If you are busy doing hw all the time, you'd think people would be less likely to move places, go on dates, hang out with friends, etc. Could this be a bit of...um...encouragement (cough* manipulation*) to comply with COVID precautions?"

It was an upper-level CS class, and I was swamped with school and work and made an incredibly dumb decision on one of my projects.

I understand that I may have some harsh consequences coming up, I am going to meet the professor over Zoom tomorrow. Sorry to post this here, I am just distraught and wanted to ask if any other students at BYU have gone through something like this? What were your experiences? Did you survive (I know it is a silly question, it just feels so earth-shattering right now)?

I have worked so hard  in my undergrad  and it is terrifying to think of what this may do...

&#x200B;

EDIT

So, one of the most stressful times of my life is now over and I honestly feel like a better person for the experience. The professor was incredibly kind and understanding, and assured me that life will go on. I felt guilt and stress about copying code for that project for months, and allowed it to hurt me, and I encourage any others who may be in a tight situation to never copy code/cheat/take the shortcut. Reach out to your professor, they are surprisingly understanding, before you make a bad choice. If, like me, you have already made the choice, try to do the honest thing. You will feel better afterwards.

&#x200B;

If anyone is a CS student and struggling in a class, feel free to reach out to me. I may be  able to talk through a  concept you are not understanding for a class, or something similar. If nothing else, I am willing to talk!"

It’s just a personal rant that I just want to get off my chest. In no way do I like to point fingers at anybody specific. 

I had a friend recently that was posted on a social media page where they denounced him of not wearing a mask. He just had it off for a couple of minutes to get that dampness off of his face. He wasn’t speaking to anyone, nor did he have malicious intent. I know this because I was there with him. And yet, people on the media treated him as if he was some sort of criminal. I would’ve understood if the person who posted the photo would’ve approached us and gave him a friendly reminder. But we received no such warning. Now, I don’t want to say who is wrong here. My friend, who is not wearing a mask, is at fault, but did he deserve such treatment? I also cannot agree. 

I’m personally not religious. But, I was a little surprised by how some, perhaps only minority, choose to act in these desperate times. Some people put their views and politics first that they forget the vital part. I don’t think most of the students have malicious intent to spread the virus. I just don’t know if pointing fingers at each other and determining who is right or wrong is the correct thing. I was just a little upset to see that some students in a heavily religious school like BYU like to blame or watch other people being accused. I understand that it's frustrating to see others, not 100% complying with the rules, but I also don’t think Jesus Christ would have reacted the way some people are reacting. 

There are just some personal thoughts that I wish to share with the community. I'm completely okay with people sharing different views or even disagreeing. 

I know most of you are great people out there. I hope you guys keep doing great things!"

The Off-Campus Housing Office is experiencing a heavy volume of inquiries concerning the contract release process. We are asking student’s to communicate with their landlord’s or the landlords’ agent(s) concerning release.  The OCHO recognizes that the contract is a legally binding agreement between the landlord and the student.  However, the OCHO strongly encourages landlords and their agents to consider the value of releasing students. 

BYU has encouraged students to consider leaving campus and return home to finish Winter semester through remote coursework. We recognize individual circumstances may not allow this. (See www.byu.edu/coronavirus for more information.) The intent of this announcement was to allow students the option, when feasible, to improve social distance in the community and their living environment, thus slowing the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. 

Please be advised that in the event the community experiences a high volume of infected and sick students, the landlords will be required to follow the direction of state and local health departments.  By agreement, landlords will be required to quarantine and isolate students.  Landlords will need to provide housing to those impacted, which may include providing quarantined housing to affected students who can no longer reside in their own apartments.  The OCHO asks that landlords carefully examine the risks associated with keeping all residents under contract.  The university will not provide solutions to housing dilemmas which may arise in your properties.  You will be responsible, by contract, for meeting the needs of those students under contract. 

The landlord contract states (#18): “Landlord agrees to maintain the facilities in accordance with all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws or ordinances and with the applicable Minimum Specifications for BYU Contracted Off-Campus Housing shown in Section 20 of the Handbook. Landlord agrees to comply with any reasonable requests of the BYU Off-Campus Housing Office relating to the safety or general welfare of tenants, and correct any failures to comply with such laws, ordinances, and specifications in a reasonable time.”

See Section 16/Management Requirements; Section 17/Respond Promptly to Problems; Section 20/The Minimum Specification in the Off-Campus Housing Handbook. (https://och.byu.edu/landlord-resources)

We ask that you carefully consider the importance of assisting the students during this extraordinary time. 

Respectfully,

The Off-Campus Housing Office"

I was in [CEEN 321](https://catalog.byu.edu/engineering/civil-and-environmental-engineering/structural-analysis). For a homework assignment, we had to do [influence line diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_line). My friend and I did ours together. In my haste, I wrote the wrong conditions in the problem set-up, but still solved the problems correctly.

After class, the professor called me into his office and said he suspected me of copying my friend's homework. I denied it, saying we had done the assignment together and I just mistranscribed some information from the book. ""Here's an idea,"" I said, ""why don't you give me a ILD problem now to prove that I'm not just copying?"" He smiled. ""That's exactly what I'm going to do.""

He reached under his desk and handed me a paper with a problem on it. I sat down and solved it in just a few minutes.

He examined it. ""Okay then, never mind. You're free to go.""

The HCO was never involved.

How about you? What's your story?"
apkyv5,I wrote a book about student social life at American colleges. BYU is chapter 20!,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/apkyv5/i_wrote_a_book_about_student_social_life_at/,34,2019-02-11 21:01:50+00:00,thestudentsyes,"Hey everyone, this is the first time I've shared anything about my book on the internet, and I'm sharing with the BYU subreddit because you all were the friendliest students when I visited.

When I was 20 years old, I went on a year long road trip around the USA to try to document the ""college experience."" I spent one week each at 23 of the nation's most interesting campuses. At each school, I would find a random student who would agree to host me. I'd sleep on their couch, go with them to class, sit next to them while they studied, and go with them to parties. Each chapter tells the true story of one week in the life of that person.

The BYU chapter has been a favorite chapter for many early readers. A lot of the book focuses on the partying, drinking, and hooking up that happens at most college campuses. But BYU was a completely different experience, and it was my happiest week out of any school.

I personally think that the BYU chapter of this book is one of the best explanations of Mormon culture for outsider readers who don't know much about Mormonism. A lot of my friends who aren't religious have read this chapter and told me they wished they could move to Provo.

You can read the beginning of the chapter here. [https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt](https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt)

If anyone wants to read the full chapter, just PM me. I'd share the full thing here, but Amazon only allows me to put 10% of the book for free on my website.

I'm curious to hear feedback!

After that meeting, I left frustrated because I was essentially hitting a brick wall. I considered writing President Worthen then but decided that it would be fruitless at best. After an incident at the Testing Center, I was rather in a huff and decided to write President Worthen himself. I wrote a respectfully worded email. I wrote, after an introduction:

>I believe that an update to the Dress & Grooming Standards is overdue, and I have the vast majority of BYU students and my own experience in professional settings to back me up. The part that the I and the vast majority of students think should change is the beard ban. The beard rule has been in place for almost 50 years now \[this was a typo, I meant to type ""60""\]. My parents weren't even alive then, and they have multiple grandchildren. Times have changed, and the beard rule has gone from being a symbol of the professionalism and conservatism of BYU to simply embarrassing the school and by association the Church that sponsors it.

I then offered to meet with him to discuss my concerns further and gave him my contact information. Then I waited.

I received this response today:

>I understand your interest in changing the bead rule, but it is not currently a priority issue for the University.   We are focusing our efforts on things such as giving students more opportunities to be involved in research, internships, study abroad and other experiential learning activities; increasing the number of students who can come to BYU, and providing more opportunities in limited enrollment programs.  I would prefer to use the energy we have to advance those and other educational priorities.   
>  
>I wish you well in your educational endeavors.

So there you have it. I honestly didn't even expect President Worthen to respond to my email, and I can respect his response. I still think the beard rule is stupid and only damaging to BYU's reputation, but with other problems the school has I can respect that it's not priority. Hopefully one of these days someone says  ""why do we still have that rule?"" in a meeting and it finally gets changed, but I'm not holding my breath and I don't think there's anything left that anyone can do. It's up to them to act, and it's just not something that they care about right now.

EDIT: some of you might be wondering why I care so much and why I've been willing to put my time and effort into getting the change. I think facial hair greatly improves my sense of masculinity and therefore my personal confidence. It makes me look older, more distinguished, and more mature. In talking with other men I've found that they feel the same. I also love BYU and think that the beard rule is a dark spot on its reputation."

It was such a hot topic of debate before COVID and I feel like a lot of issues never were resolved.

Personally, I have mixed opinions about the HCO.

First off, I love BYU's honor code and think it's awesome that the university encourages its students to live at such a high standard. The honor code sets BYU apart from other universities and creates a tame environment for LDS students seeking to be educated and spiritually uplifted.

The problem with the HCO, however, occurs when a student slips up. Unlike the gospel, which teaches that no one is perfect and repentance is possible, the Honor Code Office expects its students to be perfect. The HCO is unforgiving, and one mistake can lead to huge negative consequences in that student's education.

**In this, the Honor Code Office basically incentivizes its students to procrastinate repentance.** Even though a student may have the desire to repent of their mistakes, they might wait to do so until graduation out of fear of being suspended or expelled from school. There are other options, such as taking a year off of school and transferring schools, but these are pretty huge decisions that can be avoided if the student chooses to just stay quiet.

Now, of course, before attending the university, all BYU students are required to sign the honor code. I honestly believe that the majority of these students attend with the intention of abiding by that code as well. The reality of the situation is, however, that NO ONE is perfect. No matter how good their intentions, people are bound to slip up because we are human. I'm not saying that the HCO should allow for students to completely disregard the Honor Code. I am arguing, however, that the HCO should follow the example of our Savior and be forgiving towards the students who seek repentance and change. If a student breaks the honor code and begins taking the steps necessary to repent, I think that he/she should be allowed to continue attending the university.

**The Honor Code Office is great, but it could stand to be more forgiving towards its imperfect students.**

Anyways, those are my thoughts on the subject, but I am curious to see what everyone else thinks of BYU's current Honor Code Office policies?"
