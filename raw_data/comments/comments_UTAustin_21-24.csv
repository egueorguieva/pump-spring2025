I've seen a lot of rhetoric that students aren't here to protest but to go to school, and while that is your personal decision on attending protest or not - but student activism has played a huge role in college campuses, especially UT.

1ccunc3,l17ptws,"Thanks for the reminder, I WILL reread Umberto Eco‚Äôs 14 Points of Fascism!

1. The cult of tradition. ‚ÄúOne has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.‚Äù

2. The rejection of modernism. ‚ÄúThe Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense, Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.‚Äù

3. The cult of action for action‚Äôs sake. ‚ÄúAction being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.‚Äù

4. Disagreement is treason. ‚ÄúThe critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture, the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.‚Äù

5. Fear of difference. ‚ÄúThe first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.‚Äù

6. Appeal to social frustration. ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.

7. The obsession with a plot. ‚ÄúThe followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.‚Äù

8. The enemy is both weak and strong. ‚Äú[‚Ä¶] the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.‚Äù

9. Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. ‚ÄúFor Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.‚Äù

10. Contempt for the weak. ‚ÄúElitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.‚Äù

11. Everybody is educated to become a hero. ‚Äúin Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.‚Äù

12. Machismo and Weaponry. ‚ÄúThis is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons‚Äîdoing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise.‚Äù

13. Selective Populism. ‚ÄúThere is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.

14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. ‚ÄúAll the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.‚Äù

1ccunc3,l18rjuj,"Friendly neighborhood Girl Scout here with some helpful advice from the trenches on how to be safer at a protest!

It is vitally, critically important for you guys to start researching what actually happened in the 2020 police riots. You guys weren't old enough yet to be active in that movement. Cops are DANGEROUS and need to be treated like rabid grizzly bears.

Learn from the best of the best: You need to learn to move ‚Äúlike water‚Äù like protesters did in the Hong Kong protests, it is the best example of protest organizing in modern times and there‚Äôs no need to reinvent the wheel when the craft has already been mastered. The only reason they didn‚Äôt succeed is because the CCP has too much power and control over their lives. 

Learn how to put out tear gas canisters by submerging them in water (and keeping them because it‚Äôs the ONLY way to prove what chemicals were used against you and in Seattle in 2020 they were using banned chemicals). It‚Äôs a good idea to bring a lacrosse stick or oven mitt to protests so you can pick them up since they‚Äôre burning hot. Learn the recipes for mixtures that soothe burning on the face. DO NOT wear contacts to a protest they can melt into your eyeballs if you‚Äôre hit in the face with mace or have a severe reaction to chemical gas weapons. 

ALWAYS COVER YOUR FACE AT A PROTEST AND LEAVE YOUR PHONE AT HOME. Put a rock in your shoe because AI can identify you by how you walk (luckily it‚Äôs that easy to fool). Your university already has advanced surveillance data on you and you‚Äôre a fool if you think they don‚Äôt. You‚Äôre in Texas and that means you‚Äôre in much, much more danger than a lot of other states. Cover ALL your tattoos. Deadass you are put into a database if you protest in this country and this information WILL be used against you in the future. Protesting is NOT a safe activity to be undertaken lightly. Do not wear anything with a print on it unless it‚Äôs extremely common like boring stripes. There is a published case of a protestor being found because of the unique print on her shirt. They found the shirt on Etsy and got records of who had bought it and used this to identify her. Wear whatever colors will help you blend in with your environment in case you need to run and hide - earth tones and concrete colors are better than neons. 

Don‚Äôt dress in all black - you‚Äôll be targeted as ‚Äúantifa‚Äù and face WAY higher risk of violence if you do. Bring 3 layers of tops with you and ideally 2 hats. Taking off a jacket will help you escape once, but if you‚Äôre in serious shit you need to change your appearance at least twice. Ladies do NOT show skin - no crop tops or low cut stuff, it makes you a target for cops because they hate women. Wear loose fitting clothes you can sprint in and ALWAYS wear closed toe shoes. 

Bring a minimum of 3L of water. More is better. Access to water is not guaranteed. 

If you take psych meds that can‚Äôt be stopped instantly, honestly, consider not going because if you get arrested expect to be kept overnight or the whole weekend. Cruelty is the point and they won‚Äôt give a fuck about your brain zaps, pain, risk of psychosis, none of it. 

Don‚Äôt go to a protest without the number for a bail bondsman written on your arm in permanent marker. 

It‚Äôs possible to get yourself and others out of zip tie handcuffs and this is a skill you can learn.

Do not EVER get separated from your group, this goes to infinity for women. 

Cops target the weak - women, handicapped, smaller men, young/old people. It is the OBLIGATION of larger, fit people (especially men) to protect the vulnerable in your group. In a mosh pit they‚Äôre called blockers and they keep people on the periphery safe. White people need to shield PoC. 

Cops WILL SHOOT YOU with rubber bullets, do not entice them to because it was proven in the 2020 police riots that they aim for the head and the eyes. Deadass they will shoot you right in the eye. There were so many people blinded by cops on purpose that they were able to find each other and go on a camping trip. ‚ÄúHands up don‚Äôt shoot‚Äù was a slogan and I can‚Äôt fucking count how many times I saw people get shot literally while they were chanting that.

DO NOT DRIVE TO A PROTEST cops will slash your tires. Yes, cops, and yes this is a provable fact it happened in 2020. If cops don‚Äôt do it, agitators will. Do not drive home from a protest, you need to go somewhere else and change. You would not fucking believe how advanced surveillance is now. They can put a plane in the air that is continuously taking extremely HD pictures and after the fact when they sort through the data they can follow your car home with these pics. You aren‚Äôt going to be told one of these planes is in the air and it flies too high for you to watch. There was a program where these circled Baltimore and they were used to solve crimes - like a bank robbery would happen and they‚Äôd go back in time to see what car the robbers got into and trace it backwards to where they came from and they‚Äôd use that information to make arrests. You‚Äôre a fool if you think this only happens to criminals - it 100% has been and will be used on political dissenters.  

You can die protesting, never do it lightly. Learn what kettling is and how to make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen to you. In one town protesters were herded onto a side street, trapped between two buildings by chemical gas weapons (tear gas is a euphemism that should not be used) popped in front of and behind them, and then cops waiting in ambush popped up from a second floor garage and started spraying the crowd with rubber bullets. People got hit in the face and a ton developed legit PTSD from the incident. 

Let what happened be a lesson. Know better, do better. Learn from veterans and keep your wits about you. Always be sober at a protest! And if you were there, use a VPN and a burner account if you want to talk about it!",29,Sabertooth_squirrel_,3

During the snowpocalypse, we brought food to him 3 times a day. We delivered food straight into his underground shelter so he didn't have to go out into the cold. 

We heard him meowing in his lair the night after the worst freeze, so we knew he survived the coldest night -- but we hadn't seen any sign of him since then.

All of the other cats emerged in the nice weather, but still no Domino. We were starting to get pretty worried about him...

But he just came out tonight to get a meal delivery from his personal assistant! We are getting misty-eyed <3

1gw0mzk,ly5stsg,"The University of Texas System is expanding its free tuition program so undergraduate students whose families make $100,000 or less will receive free tuition and fees starting next fall.  
  
A committee of the UT Board of Regents gave preliminary approval to expand the Promise Plus Program on Wednesday. The full board will take a final vote Thursday. Once approved, the system will send $35 million directly to the universities to support the expansion which will apply to eligible students at all nine universities.  
  
Students must be Texas residents enrolled full-time in an undergraduate program and apply for applicable state and financial aid to qualify.  
  
The expansion is the latest move by the regents to make college more affordable for students. In 2019, the regents created a $167 million endowment at the University of Texas at Austin to provide free tuition and fees for in-state undergraduate students whose families make less than $65,000; it also provided tuition support to students from families who made under $125,000. Three years later, regents established the Promise Plus Program with a $300 million endowment fund to help other UT system universities expand their existing financial aid programs.  
  
According to the UT system, the University of Texas at El Paso expanded the income threshold for free tuition from $60,000 to $75,000, reaching 75% of households in the region.  
  
In recent years, many universities and community colleges in Texas and across the country have launched similar tuition programs to increase college access for low-income students and to encourage enrollment for those who might be hesitant to take on student debt. Many universities structure these programs so they pay what‚Äôs left on a student‚Äôs tuition bill after federal or state grants have been applied.",107,texastribune,2

I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season.""

1644m15,jy71bh4,"Hi! Another blind Longhorn here!!

Just wanna express my appreciation for helping out a blind student! I always love how helpful all the students I've met around here have been. 

To answer your curiosity, there is only accommodations for the classroom. Navigating around campus itself, there is no help from UT, but some people can get mobility training from other sources. I unfortunately am one of the ones that does not receive that help at all, but I do come to campus with my family before move-in and practice walking from my dorm to my classes until I have it down. I can probably get to my classes in similar time to anyone else, if not just a few minutes slower.

My best advice for interacting with any blind person you see around campus is just to remember we each have our own individual preferences and comfort levels when it comes ot help, and more often than not, we do know what we're doing. I personally like when people warn me about trucks/big obstructions that are not normally there or offering help for crossing streets or getting around crowds. If I'm just walking, and I don't seem to be obviously struggling, then I know what I'm doing and I'd much rather be left alone so I can focus on finding my landmarks and being aware of my surroundings. That being said, I'll absolutely never refuse help if you offer it, and I think it's always good to ask if you think someone is struggling at all. 

(Also, please don't sit on stairs or stop in the middle of sidewalks to talk to friends. I thankfully don't come across the former that often, but it's really hard for me to navigate when I'm adjusted to something and you're blocking a sidewalk/doorway and I have absolutely no idea how to get around you safely)",120,New-Coconut2650,1

187mdc3,kbfcp3l,"For everyone who chose not to click the links, the biggest point is that the letter of dismissal stated that the TAs message was unprompted (despite them receiving notice from multiple Palestinian students that their mental health was suffering), not sanctioned by the course instructor (despite the instructor allowing this message to be sent after discussion with the TAs), and not relevant to the course (Women and Madness is a course that examined mental health and all of the different factors that would cause a decline in mental health, systemic violence and oppression being among these factors). People are certainly outraged due to the retaliation that is at the root of this termination, but it's salt in the wound for the termination letter to be so blatantly full of lies.

187mdc3,kbf83nw,"I personally don‚Äôt really see anything wrong with this. I think it‚Äôs fine for the TA‚Äôs to share resources, but once they get to point of taking a stance I think their dismissal is justified. Whatever your take on the situation is, it‚Äôs not really a TAs place to assert their view of it and send it to students. I can see how that can make students uncomfortable, especially those who are Jewish. And same to those who are Muslim/Palestinian if the TA‚Äôs were to express support of Israel.

On a side note, this situation has really made me disappointed in UT students. I have never seen so much ignorance and lack of thought get walloped around. Did we just forget all of the critical thinking  skills we‚Äôve learned in college?
