1gpwsv8,lwtjhzw,"Thanks OP!‚úä

Just a reminder for everyone, if you‚Äôre a student, you are not required to report your grad instructor for striking. If you‚Äôre a grad worker, you are not required to report yourself for striking (something admin wildly decided to try to sell this morning in an email). Both of those things make admin‚Äôs and HR‚Äôs jobs easier. Let them waste time trying to figure out who is working and do their own dirty work. 

If you‚Äôre an undergrad and want to support grad students, sign this open letter to admin:

1gbhtl5,lu7ulfo,"I am curious as to why we as a country can't seem to control education costs and end up with most students having a large college education debt.¬† With all that money that is made with sports and other things, oil come come tuition was much less up through the 60s and 70s. Tuition at the UW in Seattle in 1959 60 was only $8.00 per credit.¬† That equals 40 for a 5 credit class. Minimum wage in the 60s was a $1.10 per hour. Compare to today. The other point is too much nonsense classes. We don't need them. In the UK it's 3 years assume a regular academic schedule and class load. In Germany the first degree a student gets is a Masters degree. So why are we wasting so much money on sports and nothing for actual learning?",1,Kind-Abalone-4955,3

If you or someone you know is interested in doing stuff like this more often, I help run a local LARP out of Avery Park.

All you gotta do is bring your smiling face (and possibly your costume) and we'll give you some foam sticks/projectiles to hit/throw at people. I'm also looking at getting us officially signed on at OSU as a club so that we can potentially hold a weekly practice on campus.

Here's our Discord, don't be afraid to talk and ask questions.

EDIT: Clarification. I was in no way involved in the organization of Wizard Battle. I just had a blast crashing it and wanted to plug something similar I do.

EDIT 2: This upcoming Saturday (the 18th) is gonna be one of those days.  We'll be meeting in Salem instead of Corvallis.  But we'll be back to our regularly scheduled programming next week.

This piece utilizes printmaking on Japanese woodblock print and depicts an elder looking back to the viewer as he ascends the stairs.

What captured me was the blocky texture of the piece along with the color palette; even though there's only a few colors the palette really stood out to me and felt actually pretty vibrant. This along with the composition is probably my favorite part about the piece.¬†

1gqmmef,lwzexom,"Hi there!   
I‚Äôm an OSU Graduate Teaching Assistant (GTA). GTAs who are instructors of record (i.e, are the instructors who show up on your classes registration) are in the best position to force OSU to give us a fair contract since ya‚Äôll (i.e., undergrads) are not being provided instruction that your tuition paid for. Additionally, the GTAs who grade your assignments for your professors are also striking thus causing the professor to grade the vast amount of assignments that GTAs would be responsible for. And from what I‚Äôve gathered, faculty are supporting the GTAs because they don‚Äôt want to pick up our work because it‚Äôs (time commitment/labor) not within their contracts.  
That is what our union (CGE) wanted as a result of a strike, for this system to collapse in order for OSU to be forced to meet our demands. CGE tried to avoid all this with a year of negotiations but alas OSU did not accommodate. Because OSU can‚Äôt start breaking two bargaining contracts (GTAs and faculty), they‚Äôll soon be forced to meet the CGE demands because y‚Äôall deserve what you paid for!   

From a students perspective, I would encourage you to continue with your coursework so you can keep progressing through the course. We hope that the strike is short and grading and instruction from GTAs will resume soon.  
In short- continue with your coursework outlined in each respective course‚Äôs syllabus. You will still earn a term grade. Don‚Äôt let our strike jeopardize your grades. If you need help with your assignments, then please reach out to your faculty members (i.e., professors).   

If you‚Äôd wish to support, please consider signing this petition: [https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/letter-of-support-for-coalition-of-graduate-employee-strike?source=direct_link&](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/letter-of-support-for-coalition-of-graduate-employee-strike?source=direct_link&)  

You may also copy the linked letter of support (see above) and paste it and send to the following emails:  
pres.office @oregonstate.edu jayathi.murthy@oregonstate.edu osu.provist@oregonstate.edu ed.feser@oregonstate.edu heather.horn@oregonstate.edu   

Lastly, please DO NOT reply with class or graduate student information. It is a scam by OSU to put them at risk. Please ignore the Canvas banner announcement asking you to report your GTAs.   

Solidarity forever!",116,disco-bulbasaur,1
1gqmmef,lwzxfut,"Hi OP! Grad student here. OSU is under a legal obligation to you for your class to continue and get the credit towards your degree. There is no chance that the strike will somehow cause your class to get cancelled or impact your education. In theory, the advisor on the course (not your GTA) should immediately take over grading and feedback on your assignments. If you see a delay, complain to that person. Ideally, that new instructor should complain to the university about their new workload, and then the university will offer a fair contract to the grad students. The strike is all about withholding labor until we receive fair compensation for said labor. 


As a reminder, there are some administrators (including Feser who emailed yesterday) that make in the mid six figures. There is one woman who makes $15,000/week. So it is the university that is wasting your tuition dollars on exorbitant salaries rather than supporting the bulk majority of the workforce.

Your education will benefit from appropriately paid graduate teaching assistants who can afford rent and enough to eat :) and one day if you attend graduate school, you will be grateful for a fair contract.",54,taythewizard,2
1gqmmef,lwzboun,"- Has not happened before at OSU
- Timelines for catching up on grading and posting final grades will be decided between the grad union and OSU when the strike is resolved. Grades could be delayed past the end of term, but OSU still needs to give you a grade for the course, even if it doesn't come until weeks after the end of term.
- If your course is instructed by a grad student, it's likely that no new assignments will be posted to your course (unless they are already set up in Canvas to release on a certain date). 

I'd recommend sending all of your questions and concerns to the emails listed in your screenshot and your course instructor (if they are not a grad student), or the department head for the department your course is in.

OSU can end the strike at any time by agreeing to CGE's fair and reasonable demands for their contract.",41,Ublind,3

15ihg3c,juuyt0x,"Mod here. First off, thanks for contributing to this community. However, I do want to note a few things about RMP‚Ä¶

1) Negative reviews are typically more common than positive reviews in an online environment.
2) I am finishing up my 12th (yes, 12th) and final year of college, including grad school, and RMP has been very hit and miss in my experience. I‚Äôve read really good things about professors and ended up not liking the class and vice versa.
3) Don‚Äôt push back a class another year just because a certain professor is teaching it that you haven‚Äôt heard great things about. Unless it‚Äôs a class that is offered often, there is a chance you are either stuck with the same professor the next time it‚Äôs offered, or with a potentially ‚Äúworse‚Äù professor. 
4) As I am now on the other end of this and am nearly at the point of having my PhD, please, PLEASE remember if you write reviews on RMP that there are people on the other end of those reviews. I get that some professors can be worse than others, but the vast majority of them like their jobs and want to keep them. There are posts all the time on the professors subreddit about professors getting super depressed over what people say on RMP because it‚Äôs so hurtful about them. I even worked with another PhD student (who is literally one of the nicest people in our department) that ended up quitting teaching a course because people had said harsh things about her on RMP.

So again. Thank you OP for making this and when others use it, just keep those points in mind.",18,NintendoNoNo,1

Subject: Concerns About AI-Generated Discussion Forum Posts

Dear [Professor's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to discuss an issue I've observed in our course's discussion forum that I believe warrants attention. It has become apparent that some students are using AI tools to generate their discussion posts, which violates the course's academic integrity policies.

While the forum participation only constitutes a minor portion of their overall grade, it still plays a critical role in encouraging students to engage with the material, think critically, and articulate their thoughts. The use of AI-generated content undermines these educational objectives, allowing students to gain credit without genuinely participating in the learning process.

Here are a few reasons why I believe this issue needs to be addressed:

1. **Academic Integrity**: Allowing AI-generated posts compromises the integrity of our course and the value of the students' efforts. It sets a precedent that using unauthorized tools is acceptable, which can lead to broader issues of academic dishonesty.
¬† ¬†
2. **Learning Outcomes**: The discussion forum is designed to help students develop their ability to analyze, synthesize, and communicate ideas. By using AI, students miss out on these critical learning opportunities, which can adversely affect their performance in more significant assignments and their overall understanding of the material.

3. **Fairness**: Students who follow the rules and invest time in crafting their responses are at a disadvantage compared to those who take shortcuts. This discrepancy can lead to frustration and a sense of unfairness among the student body.

4. **Long-term Skills**: Effective communication and critical thinking are essential skills that our students need to develop for their future careers. Reliance on AI-generated content hinders the development of these skills, which are integral to their success beyond our course.

I suggest implementing more rigorous checks to ensure the authenticity of the students' posts. This could include random checks of discussion posts for AI-generated content, using plagiarism detection tools that are increasingly capable of identifying AI-written text, or even redesigning assignments to require more personalized reflections that are harder to automate.

I am happy to discuss this further and assist in any way possible to uphold the academic standards of our course. Thank you for considering this matter.

14zbl1v,jryua8l,"...So you transferred in with an associates in animation, with no clear indication other than word of mouth that at some point the university ***MAY*** have animation classes down the line? And didn't think to ask about how the graphic design credits may transfer out if you didn't like OSU? So why did you chose Oregon State instead of a more arts-centric school like University of Oregon? Or a more remote-friendly accredited university with a comprehensive animation program?

In any case - everyone's experience is a little different; it's how you utilize your time and energy at university.

I have a friend that was a graphic design major; he now makes $100k+ for an advertising and experiential marketing agency. He graduated from OSU in 2016 with me. During his time at Oregon State, he used that time to develop and advance his personal portfolio outside of coursework - as well as networking. He didn't do any 3D work with any coursework but ended up self-teaching himself a lot, and it's aided his journey to get him where he's now.

The same could be said for me - I went for Digital Communications; if I would've changed majors or tried to go to a different school, I would have been in a pickle for sure. And to be frank - I felt like I didn't learn a lot either. But I spent my free time working with influencers and content creators in addition to working and going to school full-time. It wasn't something they were teaching at the time (and possibly, still aren't). But because I have this stupid piece of paper, and a professional background in the field I want - I now am doing alright for myself, and have led worldwide campaigns for brands like Google, Calvin Klein, EA, and more.

All this to say - I'm not defending Oregon State as yes, transferring credits would have been a nightmare - and yeah, advisors suck - but that's kind of the gist everywhere. Buuuut if you're not doing your due diligence, or willing to accept the compromises you have to make to get to where you want - is that really all on Oregon State?",22,hutchison15,3

xpuy2b,iq5yxmh,"A reminder to walkers, bikers and drivers to stay alert and vigilant. Get off your phone. Look up and around. Everyone traveling around the general Monroe area is so often distracted (including me). Remember that. Drivers, bikers, walkers, skateboarders - no one is paying nearly enough attention and are almost always distracted.  Particularly at the start of a term when everyone is confused about figuring out where their classes are. Even more so at the start of Fall term when new students are just in general trying to learn their way around OSU. Drivers - get off your phone, leave ten minutes earlier so you aren't rushing, and generally make more of an effort to not to injure and kill people.

Edit: I didn't mean for this to come across as if drivers don't hold the responsibility. You are driving a car for fucks sake, it's your job to not run people over. I also wanted to remind people not in vehicles to please be aware that this is a HUGE problem in Corvallis. It sucks but it's a reality so please keep in mind that a huge portion of drivers aren't paying attention. Beyond that, drivers will stare at you waiting at a crosswalk and make no effort whatsoever to slow down. Just because they see you doesn't mean they will stop.",16,yeahsotheresthiscat,3
