18ne6kt,kea7lsr,"Question - would Harvard discipline students for this level of plagiarism?  Sure, you probably won’t get expelled for 1 instance of plagiarism (although failing the paper or class is likely).  But would any student not get expelled for plagiarism in 14 separate papers?  Are students allowed to request “corrections” to avoid discipline for plagiarism?

Should the academic integrity policy be interpreted different for students, faculty, and the president?  

Why should the student body tolerate plagiarism by the President if the administration doesn’t tolerate plagiarism by students?

Any student accused of plagiarism should cite this case as a defense and then argue discrimination if they are not treated the same as Dr. Gay.

By letting this slide, Harvard has declared that repeated plagiarism is a non-issue.  It’s like making a harmless typo and can simply be “corrected” when called out, with no adverse consequences.",147,zahm2000,1

From the WSJ article: https://www.wsj.com/articles/claudine-gay-and-why-academic-honesty-matters-plagiarism-research-science-98a441c1

“In appointing Ms. Gay, the Harvard Corp., the university’s governing board, seems to have shifted the institution’s priorities. It revealed those goals in its Dec. 12 statement, noting that Ms. Gay is the right leader “to address the very serious societal issues we are facing.” Harvard’s mission is no longer simply advancing knowledge, but knowledge “that will help address deep societal issues and promote constructive discourse.” From such a perspective, academic honesty seems to matter less than having the right progressive values, and the refusal to disclose underlying data is permissible so long as conclusions support a preferred narrative. Harvard is still among the world’s premier research universities. It still has a great deal to offer, and calls on the right for it to be taxed or regulated at the state level—by Massachusetts—are shortsighted. The university nevertheless needs a reset. It can’t continue down the path of political engagement, which undermines its true mission. If the university’s governing bodies continue to behave as though academic dishonesty isn’t of great concern, it can only damage our hard-won prestige, cheapen the value of our degrees and erode the standards necessary for academic excellence.” (James Hankins, WSJ, 2023)

Also it’s really not hard to cite sources I can understand a improper citation like used APA instead of Chicago or messed up the MLA format in your paper but the current incidents are much beyond that and I know that if I and others did something similar as students we would not be granted such leniency. The President should not have academic misconduct immunity due to her post.",104,MrBoxer42,1

My rankings are based solely on aesthetics and not on any symbolism. For anyone interested, the wikipedia page linked above explains the symbolism for most of these shields.

S-tier:

* The adorned Veritas shield is absolutely gorgeous. Nothing else to say.
* HLS is very aesthetically pleasing. The clean curves and crimson color gradient are beautiful and remind me of stained glass windows. The ʟᴇx ᴇᴛ ɪᴜsᴛɪᴛɪᴀ on the white background is imposing and assertive, and it pairs well with the ᴠᴇʀɪᴛᴀs just above. Truth, law, and justice. Like the adorned shield, I have nothing negative to say about HLS.
* SPH and HBS have similar qualities. They're both clean and instantly recognizable. The color balances both feel a tad heavy on the white but it's not a big deal. The crosses and their respective decorations look great. However, the outlines & border for HBS are much thicker than for any other shield, and I think it's too much. So HBS goes below SPH.

A-tier:

* HDS: I'm a sucker for chevrons and this one has the perfect thickness and placement. The holly sprigs and wood pigeons fill out the space decently, but also make it feel a bit crowded and messy. The pigeons also make the color balance feel a bit too white.
* SEAS doesn't look too great in this image but it's just because of the dark background of the image. When the shield is placed on a lighter background it [looks much better](https://imgur.com/a/AK9hBJ9). The chain stitch is a nice detail. The ragged cross isn't particularly alluring but it does strike a good balance between being too plain and being too noisy.
* College: The chevron on this one is good, but it feels a bit thin. There's some open space to the left & right of the chevron but it's not a big deal. Looks great overall.
* HMS is cool at first glance, but if you look closely, the lion looks kind of weird and deformed. If it were the [lion on the wikipedia page](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Harvard_Medical_School.svg/1657px-Harvard_Medical_School.svg.png) that I linked above, HMS would be S-tier.

B-tier:

* Veritas / FAS: Bread and butter. It's the ubiquitous base design and it's a tad plain, but still good.
* GSAS is fairly plain. The white stripe doesn't add anything to the base Veritas shield, it just makes the shield feel too horizontal.
* Dental: Among the shields that have the ᴠᴇʀɪᴛᴀꜱ chief at the top, this one is the most boring. Also the rectangular shape of the castle doesn't fill out the space well.
* HGSE would possibly be in A-tier, but closer inspection reveals that (1) the two black flowers aren't vertically aligned, (2) the steps aren't all the same length, and (3) the steps have a weird diagonal lip at the top left. These all greatly annoy me.

C-tier:

* HES is wider & rounder than the rest of the shields which IMO looks worse. The chevron is too low and too thin, and it's at 42° angles unlike the 45° angles of the chevrons for HDS and College, which annoys me. The chief is not distinctly separated enough from the rest of the shield. The lamp and the bushels of wheat are okay though.
* GSD looks awful. It's just way too messy. It's an eyesore.
* HKS is somehow both too noisy *and* too bland. At least GSD *tried* to do something unique, this one is just a bunch of thin stripes and it looks terrible. Also the stripes become way too small at the bottom due to the shape of the shield.
* Radcliffe just looks bad. The two black stripes are not enough decoration for a shield with no other details. The orange border feels too thick and I dislike that shade of orange, it feels too vibrant. Importantly, this shield is missing the black outlines and borders present in every other shield. I made a [quick edit](https://imgur.com/a/ymLEAln) of what this shield would look like with outlines and IMO it looks much better. The [old shield](https://web.archive.org/web/20210120143833im_/https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/sites/all/themes/rias/images/logo.svg) also looked much better.",19,SheepHerdr,3

When talking to a lot of people that I felt had it all together, most of them came from parents who actually cared about their grades growing up, got them tutors, helped find them opportunities that aided their growth, went to good schools, etc.

I don't say that's as a slight against them, at all. 

It just contrasted me in a way that made me feel inadequate. 

My parents were absent. Never cared about my grades. Never cared about whether I went to college or not. Didn't help me if I was struggling in school.

The districts I attended school up through high school were the poorest in my state. I had overworked teachers who couldn't help.

And when I got to Harvard later on - I felt like the loser just starting to get his crap together amongst peers who had been academic rockstars since age 9.

It's hard to shake that feeling. And I do NOT say this to denigrate or downplay the accomplishments of a lot of students because they DID that work and they earned their reputation, BUT there's a lot of privilege and advantage that having engaged parents, good primary schools, and adults who help foster growth in students prior to college. And for some students - having the wealth to afford to live somewhere with good schools, a job that pays well enough that the parents can have time to help their kid, and being able to afford tutors, etc. - it makes it easier. Not easy - but easier.

18stvps,kf9r4jn,"From the WSJ article:

“In appointing Ms. Gay, the Harvard Corp., the university’s governing board, seems to have shifted the institution’s priorities. It revealed those goals in its Dec. 12 statement, noting that Ms. Gay is the right leader “to address the very serious societal issues we are facing.” Harvard’s mission is no longer simply advancing knowledge, but knowledge “that will help address deep societal issues and promote constructive discourse.” From such a perspective, academic honesty seems to matter less than having the right progressive values, and the refusal to disclose underlying data is permissible so long as conclusions support a preferred narrative.
Harvard is still among the world’s premier research universities. It still has a great deal to offer, and calls on the right for it to be taxed or regulated at the state level—by Massachusetts—are shortsighted. The university nevertheless needs a reset. It can’t continue down the path of political engagement, which undermines its true mission. If the university’s governing bodies continue to behave as though academic dishonesty isn’t of great concern, it can only damage our hard-won prestige, cheapen the value of our degrees and erode the standards necessary for academic excellence.”

Assuming the Crimson's [earlier reporting of the FAS meeting](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/5/21/faculty-vote-allow-suspended-seniors-graduate/) is accurate, only 115 FAS faculty attended the meeting from among the 888 FAS faculty eligible to vote (<13%). The Crimson reported that this was ""an unusually high turnout for proceedings that are usually pro forma."" It can be reasonably assumed that the unusually high attendance was driven by FAS faculty who disagree with the Ad Board's decision with regard to the affected students. The remaining >87% of voting FAS faculty members didn't even bother to attend and it's still unclear exactly how many of the 13% that did attend voted in favor of adding back the 13 disciplined students to the list of degrees recommended for conferral beyond The Crimson's statement that the group voted ""overwhelmingly"" to reinstate. The Corporation rightly did not accept this vote as justifying a reversal of the disciplinary decisions made by the Ad Board.

The more interesting controversy is the behavior of FAS faculty members who don't seem to understand that the behavior of the sanctioned students had a negative impact on the Harvard community and undermined what should be a shared commitment to civil discourse or, at least, an understanding that civil disobedience warrants valid and meaningful disciplinary consequences. They don't acknowledge as MIT's president did in [a recent communication](https://president.mit.edu/writing-speeches/actions-morning) that unlike past protest movements on campus that ""This situation is fundamentally different.

CONCORD, N.H. — Denise Lodge, 63, covered her face with a printout of the indictment against her Wednesday afternoon as she walked silently from the federal courthouse following her arrest on charges related to an alleged scheme to steal and sell donated body parts.  


  
Her husband, Cedric Lodge, 55, the morgue manager at Harvard Medical School, had allegedly taken human remains from his workplace without permission and engaged in an interstate conspiracy to profit off of them.  


  
“We are appalled to learn that something so disturbing could happen on our campus — a community dedicated to healing and serving others,” George Q. DaleyDean, of the Faculty of Medicine at Harvard University, and Edward M. Hundert, Dean for Medical Education at Harvard Medical School, said in an e-mail statement.  


  
“The reported incidents are a betrayal of HMS and, most importantly, each of the individuals who altruistically chose to will their bodies to HMS through the Anatomical Gift Program to advance medical education and research.”  


  
Cedric Lodge was terminated from his job at Harvard on May 6, according to the university.

I could see this as being a very meaningful step in deterring future violations of Harvard's rules against disrupting university operations if the affected students are unable to return to campus in the fall and miss instructional time.

It’s normal to have moments of doubt and frustration during your college experience. Many students go through similar challenges and it can be easy to feel isolated, especially with all the studying you’re doing. The pressures and expectations of attending such a prestigious university can be overwhelming. You’re much more than a student and grades are not everything. You’ve already achieved a significant accomplishment getting where you are and you deserve to be proud of it. Your college experience isn’t only about academics but the connections and personal growth along the way. 

It’s never too late to try to connect with people and explore opportunities outside of your studies. If you study less, gpa drops, but you’re mentally healthy, growing, and meeting people, that’s a win in my book.

You mention not having any friends, maybe no one knows you who are, that’s an opportunity - a blank slate - you can be whoever you want to be. No expectations, freedom.

They make big money off people taking a class or two who think they might get a degree but stop etc.                          And because the students are located all over the world and not united under the same roof, they don’t organize themselves into a powerful alumni or student group that could advocate for change.

t63bag,hzcyhxy,"Edit:  I see what's happening now.  In 2021, as a degree candidate you paid $1,880 which was discounted from the normal $3,400.  In 2022, you will pay the degree candidate rate of $1,920, which is discounted from the normal $3,500.

For 2022, you also have a $200 health insurance charge that you either need to waive or pay.  You were not charged that in 2021 since HSS was virtual and did not require health insurance.

To summarize:

* **HSS non-degree candidates inflated 2.9%** from $3,400 to $3,500.
* **HES ALB degree candidates inflated 2.1%** from $1,880 to $1,920.

y8tsq9,it2zlkn,"1L is a bitch.  People are short and antisocial because everybody in HLS 1L (and I mean *everybody*) is drowning. The spoiled brats with mommy/daddy connections are just clinging on to those connections like a buoy, because they're also drowning.  

It gets so much easier though.  The job offers will come.  If not biglaw then bigtech or a startup or non profit or really anything you want.  

Some things that got me through:

1) Social events with people from other graduate programs.  Harvard graduate commons does mixers, fall walks to various preserves, museum visits and more.  

2) Check out beer and dogs on Fridays at the GSD.  Everyone there is drowning too, but the gene pool is totally different from HLS.

3) Take a class at the Kennedy school or HBS during 2L/3L.  Even the divinity school!  Or MIT!  Lots of options to cross register.  Don't feel like you're stuck with your 1L cohort. 

4) Sign up for a [class at the ceramics lab](https://ofa.fas.harvard.edu/ceramics/courses).  It's a quiet temple to clay on the other side of the river, tons of busses and shuttles go there, and it will keep you sane.  

5) Take some time every week to go do something in Boston or in the area.  Right now the north shore is -stunning-.  We might be post peak leaf but still.   Rent a zip car, take a walk on Plum Island, or Crane Beach or Halibut Point.  Stop by woodmans of essex for fried clams.  Get some north shore roast beef (I like Glenns).   Take the 72/74 bus to Mt Auburn, visit middlesex fells, or check out the gardner museum...getting distance from the tiny world of HLS is your friend here.",30,Vermillionbird,2

I did not go to HLS, but there were times at Harvard undergrad where I felt phenomenally, profoundly, earth shatteringly alone.

Take it one step at a time and you’ll eventually realize that you’re just as competent and capable as the students who were born with big law connections and swaddled in Con Law outlines as baby blankets.

You’re doing better than you think you are. Reach out for community wherever you can find it and remember all the incredible things you had to do to get where you are.

I am sorry for the unkindness you’ve been exposed to, but you will eventually find generous people who cut against Harvard’s institutional grain.

You are where you are now - you can still do whatever the fuck you want with your life. I mean that sincerely. You can go back to gradschool for anything. I knew someone who decided to become a doctor their senior year after concentrating in humanities. She took two years of science classes at another college and got into med school. 

I think its pretty healthy to say, wow if I knew what I know now, I would've done things differently. It means you're getting smarter. 

Look at people in their 30s+ who are living lives you want to live and figure out how they got there. Then do those things. You also need to decide what the probability of success is for you in that path (for example being a doctor vs being an Olympic gymnast)

To the rest of the world, you're a Harvard grad. No one except you really gives a shit how you spent your time there. 

For me personally- Harvard was a low point, I took a very circuitous path, ended up in a place I never imagined, and met my wife. Life is still challenging, but in a good way.

1fe0vmp,lmk0lvx,"It was registration day. I was in my last semester on campus and my class had graduated that spring. So I had 10 good friends still in school and half of us lived off campus. We bundled up watching TV to figure out what was going on like most people. It wasn’t obvious at first but many friends were starting Wall Street jobs that month, but we were still at school. I remember walking across campus with everyone in a daze to drop off some paperwork. 

We had shopping period then, so the next week was very odd. All interesting professors had to have an instant POV on the news and if their course would change. I took an economics of the middle east class. Usually it had 12 people in it - 50 showed up and the prof said the course was not going to change. My terrorism class went from 50 people to 250. 

The other change was how militaristic the country and the campus became. I know folks that went to the military after that. In my building there was a HBS guy that was called back to the service. And debates about going to war with Afghanistan and Iraq increased throughout the semester. 

That day was spooky for me. We knew the world had changed that morning but didn’t know why or how.",96,gofaaast,1
1fe0vmp,lml8x3d,"The weather was spectacular.  One of those perfectly clear fall days with no wind.  Warm, but just a hint of crispness in the air.  It was my junior year.  I remember getting woken up by one of my block mates shouting “someone just crashed a plane into the World Trade Center”.  

My memory is that eventually classes were cancelled, but nobody had gone anyway.  We were all glued to any TV we could find in our dorms.  The Internet was a thing, but social media was not.  So TV and news websites (cnn.com, nytimes.com, thecrimson.com etc.) were the main sources of information.

In the morning, the news came very fast, with first one, then the second plane hitting the towers (we all were watching live as the second plane hit), and then the attack on the Pentagon, and then the last plane going down in PA on the way to DC.    


There was a lot we didn’t know.  We had more comprehensive, and horrific, views of the attacks on the WTC than we did of the Pentagon and the site in PA.  We knew that the FAA was grounding all traffic, but reports kept coming in of planes in the air anyway.  The president and vice president were in undisclosed locations, and didn’t communicate until later in the day.  We learned that the attackers had taken off at Logan airport.  We worried about additional attacks, including, to some extent, on Harvard itself.  There wasn’t much we could do except worry.

Some students and faculty had friends and relatives in New York and DC.  And as the day went on most people had quiet phone calls with family and friends, wherever they were, to connect and confirm.

  
Thoughts turned to what would come next quite quickly after 9/11.  But on the day itself we were watching, keeping our heads down.  Campus was quiet and still as we all tried to understand what was going on.",31,tmckd,2

1gq31ex,lwv22ty,"Standard but good advice:

* Nobody ""deserves"" to get into Harvard. The admissions office could fill classes with people with 1600 SATs **or** published science papers **or** national sports titles **or** incredible adversity stories. Anyone who got in got lucky and could have been replaced by someone equally good on paper, we all have to accept that and make the most of our luck.
* There's no objective ranking of applicant merit. Harvard is trying to assemble a class that will go off and do great things and make Harvard look good (and donate lots of money). This is 100% a guessing game, and they hedge their bets with people who look promising in all kinds of ways, from winning international math competitions, to overcoming K-12 antiblackness to get great grades, to having rich parents. You're here because of what Harvard thinks you might become, not who you were in high school.
* Race-based AA, whatever forms it has taken and/or may still take, is frankly one of the most justifiable routine deviations from a pure numbers-based ""merit"" approach. Being black and/or native American is still a real obstacle for a US kid on average, and it's rational to factor that in when assessing on-paper accomplishments. Meanwhile, a high proportion of your classmates got a boost from legacy status, going to a name-brand prep school, being good at a rich-person sport, etc. You're just under more of a daily spotlight.

tl;dr: if you want to ""deserve"" your spot here, stop worrying about how you got it. Just focus on what you're here to do and ignore the haters in your head.",48,vegatwyss,1

1gq31ex,lwv0aok,"You know what, white people always get the benefit of the doubt, meanwhile treating other races as lesser than.

You could have been the best all around applicant. 

AA was a good thing. It sucks that we had to make a policy to insist that organizations stop passing over qualified applicants because of their race. And it sucks even more than the Supreme Court didn't defend it. 

Now that trump has been elected, things are going to much worse for minorities, because they don't deserve to be here as much as white people do?It's 2024 and we're still privileging whiteness. Fuck everything about that (I'm white btw). White people have been keeping others out of the circle ever since this country started. You have every right and more to be at Harvard.

1fnrq3g,lol8mrk,"* Make a list of 1-5 things you legitimately might want to do in a future (PhD in X, join company Y, etc.) and work backwards from there to prioritize what really matters (from a career/post-grad POV).  Lots of stuff becomes unimportant when you realize it is truly disconnected from anything at the top of your list.

* Periodically redo the above exercise--your top 5 or understanding of what matters may change.

* Interview current students ahead of you, recent grads, and/or older alumni about their paths.  Use that to again check your prioritization list.

If the above sounds like a bunch of work...it isn't supposed to!  It is supposed to do the opposite--help you deal with rampant FOMO, because there are a bazillion possible time sucks, including for things that you think you *might* want (""well what if I *did* want to join McKinsey?"") but truly don't.

* Clubs really don't matter that much, except 1) for very specific paths and 2) insofar as they are directly teaching you critical things.  Don't stress too much, and don't spend more time on them than you actually can rationalize.

* Your specific coursework similarly doesn't matter for most pursuits.  This doesn't mean that learning doesn't matter, but rather than class X versus Y likely won't matter in 5 years, so don't stress if you can't fit in a specific course or second concentration or whatnot.  Exceptions to all of this, of course, for very specific paths like PhD in STEM fields.

* Along those lines, figure out how much your GPA matters.  

This might sound a little odd, but going back to the ""top 5"" list--

There are a lot of paths where your GPA really doesn't matter (as long as it isn't awful).  But also a few where it really does (certain graduate programs, as limited # of high-end career options, etc.).  

If you're gunning for a path where that ~4.0 really does make a difference...have at it.

If you're not (and be honest with yourself), 1) relax a little and 2) put your energies elsewhere.

Know/learn what you need to do.

* Summer internships are great, both from a career POV (crucial for resume) and for getting you outside of the Harvard bubble.  Understand how the application processes work, and treat it like a priority activity.  Success (first internship) begets success (more options for second) here.

(This doesn't mean that if you don't get your dream internship you're hosed!  Just each step is marginally easier, if you're thoughtful in building a path forward.)

* Go into Boston occasionally.  Even if just to walk around with friends.

* Exercise. Lift weights.  Maybe start a martial art like BJJ.

* Lastly, run the same ""top 5"" exercise for things that you actually enjoy and/or help you recover.  Give bonus points for things which get you mixing with your classmates.",71,farmingvillein,1
1fnrq3g,lonzkem,"Make good friends.  Harvard alums are good to know.  They seem normal now but many of them will go on to do great things.  Like Conan O’Brien, Bill Gates, Zuckerberg, Tom Morelli, Yo Yo Ma…",18,dave3948,2
1fnrq3g,lonzmzr,"I’m going to approach this completely differently than the other comment here, just to give another perspective (though their advice is actually also great). While many strategies focus on building a long-term career through goal setting and prioritization, I think there’s a more holistic approach to enjoying college life without feeling like you’re sacrificing your future.

1. Focus on Exploration, Not Just Optimization
College is one of the few times in life when you’re surrounded by a huge variety of people, ideas, and activities. By stepping outside of a hyper-focused path, you might stumble upon something you’re passionate about, even if it doesn’t align with pre-set goals. A flexible, exploratory mindset may still lead to career success, but it also creates room for serendipity. (I stumbled into my current career path because of this)

2. Enjoy the People and Build Relationships, Not Just Networks
Networking is important, but don’t approach every relationship with a career-oriented lens. Instead, enjoy genuine connections with people because those are the relationships that often end up shaping your life. Career networks are fine, but the friends who stick by you through the highs and lows will be just as—if not more—important.

3. Balance Achievement with Personal Fulfillment
I’d say focus on doing things that make me happy and fulfilled—whether that’s joining a fun club, pursuing a hobby, or taking classes purely for interest. Sure, academics and career goals matter, but finding activities that give you joy and balance out the stress is what makes college a memorable experience.

4. Use Mistakes as Learning Opportunities, Not Career Setbacks
Many stress over GPA, internships, and getting everything “right.” But I think it’s more productive to embrace mistakes as learning experiences rather than career-destroying failures. It’s in those moments where you find personal growth, and that can build resilience for your future career. Nobody cares if your (massively inflated) GPA has a handful of non-A’s on it. But being able to speak candidly about your growth in your ability to handle increasingly complex material, your past failures and subsequent growths will pay dividends in your life. 

5. Career Can Wait; Experiences Can’t
A job or a career path can be pursued at any point in life. But this moment, surrounded by a unique environment with access to resources, people, and freedom to explore? That’s limited to now. If you can, try to travel, attend events, and engage with people beyond just my field of study because those are experiences you can’t replicate later. 

6. Physical and Mental Health Over Resume Building
Exercise, sleep, and mental well-being should come first. Burning out in the name of career preparation isn’t going to pay off in the long run. Building a healthier lifestyle now will benefit your future success far more than a perfect resume will.

In short, my approach is to prioritize personal growth, meaningful connections, and life experiences over a rigid focus on career optimization. That way, I’ll leave college with not just a diploma, but a set of rich memories and a fuller understanding of myself and the world around me.",18,AestheticChimp,3

Plenty of positives, but with a booster mandate on the student body (and substantially all of the faculty / staff fully vaxxed as well), no one’s getting meaningfully sick. They even put out a statement that they’re going to treat it like flu season at this point, and it’s working. They’re also offering full refunds to anyone who decides that they disagree with the policy + wants to take a semester off. And the students are ecstatic — at some point you have to make some sort of trade-off between safety and the scholastic experience of a population who is, as a whole, very equipped to deal with this threat.

On the other hand… get some closure. I’d make an appointment and sit down with the professor and talk it out. Mend the bridge, thank him or her, apologize if need be. Admit your faults, show your appreciation for their part. You aren’t the only one who has been there and this shows true courage, accountability and willingness to improve in the future which is commendable.

Clover - overpriced but quality and variety.  sabich platter is amazing

Otto - pizza slices, decent crust, interesting toppings.

Tatte - espresso, baked goods, brunch is always packed.  

Bonchon - korean fried chicken, tteokbokki

Charlies Kitchen - the last real dive bar.  bar food, cheap drinks, decor. 

outside the yard:


Darwins on Cambridge has good sandwiches and espresso

Savinors on Kirkland also has good sandwiches.  Hours are weird IIRC

Alive and Kicking Lobsters on Putnam - Lobster rolls 

in boston:

Shawarma Falafel - favorite falafel and schwarma place

Monica's Mercato - best sandwiches in the city.  worth the trip to the north end. the italian is sub is https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EMC113hXYAAIQHF.jpg

1epsaz7,lhn08xo,"The museums for sure. Everything from art to prehistoric humans to whales to dinosaurs. Discuss what your kid is really interested in seeing and focus on going to that museum. 

The stained glass in Memorial Hall is well worth the the visit. Don’t try to go in through the huge wood doors on the front. They’re always locked. Go to the metal doors to the left of the big main entrance. They’re unlocked and anyone can visit. It takes just a few minutes but the view is impressive enough that a kid will love it. 

Also visit Memorial Church. Incredible architecture that a kid would love, and to the right of the sanctuary is the actual memorial to Harvard’s fallen vets. Very impressive space and the staff loves to guide visitors through it. 

Walk the iconic walk from Harvard Yard down to the Kennedy School, to the river, and over the bridge to the Business School. Some of the best scenery on campus.",9,Beginning_Brick7845,3

th0m15,i15o0po,"I didn't take the class, but I think I can give you a general idea of how it is like. The material in the class is very difficult (as the math taught is very abstract) and fast paced (covers material from 4 other math courses in 2 semesters), and it is time-consuming, but it is graded pretty leniently. Psets are worth like 60% of the grade in the class, and the midterms are take-home, so if you're at the level of math where you can take and finish the class, you'll probably get a good grade, even if you don't understand a lot of the material.

As another commenter said, many students who take it don't drop because they can't handle the class, but because they don't want to commit the 20 hours a week or so to math. Once you have the mathematical maturity to take Math 55, the only thing that stops you from taking the class is your willingness to spend most of your semester on math. That's why they say don't take it unless you want to spend the bulk of your semester on math or you are seriously considering a career in mathematics.

I don't even think you need to be a genius to take it. I would say most STEM students (in Computer Science and Applied Math, especially, at Harvard would be able to take the class as a sophomore or junior or if they had more background beyond high school math before coming to college. I would say being able to take and finish Math 55 has to do more with commitment than intellect.",20,Ok-Kaleidoscope-7320,1
th0m15,i15teru,"It's a class designed for the like top 10 math students in the country, who've already had 1-3 years of college level math education in high school (college level here meaning beyond calculus). I thought very highly of my mathematical abilities and took Linear Algebra and Real Analysis in high school and yet, when I got to 55, I basically died. I was the worst student in the class my year and the professor called me to his office and told me to drop the class. Now, being my stubborn self, I refused to do that and stuck it out and yeah - it was over my head. In retrospect, I would say if I had been adequately prepared, the class would have been fine, though a lot of work. In the end, I am happy I took the class and I use the material frequently in my day job. It also basically showed me that I didn't want to do a math undergrad (did Physics instead). The best part about it is probably hanging out with the other people class - they're usually a great bunch and extremely smart. I guess I should add the disclaimer that the year after us took the position that we had it extremely easy compared to their experience - so YMMV based on instructor ;).",12,loladiro,2
th0m15,i15c5sr,"Difficulty depends, in part, on the instructor (which seems to change every year), as does the selection of topics covered.
