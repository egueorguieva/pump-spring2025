# EMAIL FROM OREGON STATE

11 March 2020

Oregon State University is committed to state, national and global efforts to reduce the risk and spread of COVID-19, while appropriately continuing the essential activities of teaching, research, OSU Extension and engagement. While at this time, the public health risk in Oregon from the coronavirus is lower than it is in other states, we became aware today of a presumptive COVID-19 case in Deschutes County and testing for a possible case in Benton County is underway.

**Effective Saturday, March 14, OSU will move to a higher level of response that continues the essential operations of the university, but seeks to reduce the frequency of interactions among students, faculty, staff and visitors throughout all university campuses, centers, facilities and operations. Our focus is on continued university operations and social distancing.**

In taking these steps, we remain mindful and informed by the public health guidance of our local county health departments, the Oregon Health Authority and the CDC.

**Effective March 14, 2020:**

¬ß  Campuses and OSU facilities and operations statewide will remain open.

¬ß  Winter term finals week exams and activities will be delivered remotely where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

¬ß  University academic and remote meeting tools, including Canvas and Zoom, will be used to minimize in-person meetings.

¬ß  All non-essential OSU-sponsored travel will be suspended.

¬ß  All OSU employees will be encouraged to work remotely where work responsibilities and duties allow.

¬ß  All OSU students, faculty and staff are encouraged to avoid personal travel over spring break. Students should instead consider remaining at our campuses in Corvallis and Bend.

We are taking these immediate steps while OSU employees and students prepare to take expanded public health measures at the start of spring term.

**Effective March 30, 2020:**

¬ß  All of the above actions are maintained.

¬ß  All spring term courses, labs and exams will be delivered remotely, where possible. Where remote teaching, coursework and testing is not possible, maximum social distancing measures will be utilized.

¬ß  Until at least April 30, no non-essential OSU-sponsored events of more than 50 attendees will be permitted. All events with fewer than 50 attendees will be held with maximum social distancing.

**The status of these measures will be evaluated every two weeks.**

We recognize such steps will prompt many questions and cause disruption. We ask for everyone to accommodate these changes, engage in and support appropriate support personal health measures, support as able other OSU community members, and frequently check the university‚Äôs [COVID-19 website](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus) for updated information.

Given that OSU plans that all university operations will remain in effect, we anticipate the continued employment and benefits for all employees. During this time, the university will seek to continue the employment of its student workers.

The following provides additional information regarding important aspects of OSU‚Äôs COVID-19 response.

**SOCIAL DISTANCING:** The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention define [social distancing](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/risk-assessment.html) as avoiding crowds and mass public gatherings, and when possible, maintaining a distance of approximately six feet from others. Social distancing also means staying at home when ill, avoiding contact with people who have symptoms of illness, and not shaking hands.

**FINAL EXAMS:** Because OSU will administer final exams using a social distancing model, for those exams that must be held in-person, the university will seek to relocate final exams to locations where room capacity is three times the number of people registered to take that test. Faculty will notify students of changes in finals week logistics.

**REMOTE TEACHING:** Remote teaching delivery is when a faculty member facilitates the delivery of their in-person course instruction from a different location by using tools such as Canvas and Zoom. With the¬†suspension of face-to-face meetings and the requirement for remote teaching, OSU will provide key resources available to faculty, staff and students. These include the following web pages: [Keep Teaching](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-teaching), [Keep Learning](https://learn.oregonstate.edu/keep-learning) and [Keep Working](https://uit.oregonstate.edu/keep-working). If you have any questions or require any technology assistance, please [contact the Service Desk](http://is.oregonstate.edu/help). Additionally, there will be online and telephone resources readily available to help students navigate all aspects of online delivery, including Zoom.

Additional information on remote teaching is available for all students, faculty and staff within the university‚Äôs COVID-19 web page [‚ÄúHot Topics‚Äù under remote teaching.](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/coronavirus/remote-teaching-learning-and-working-faq)

**SPRING BREAK:** We ask that OSU students, faculty and staff carefully evaluate Spring Break travel plans. If you are a student, please consider staying on campus or simply going home instead of traveling elsewhere during the break. OSU‚Äôs residence halls will remain open during spring break. If you are an employee, please consider remaining within your home community. We realize this may disrupt your plans, but broader travel within the U.S. and abroad brings additional risk of exposure to COVID-19, which includes the possibility of self-isolation upon return.

**EVENTS:** OSU‚Äôs future requirements regarding events is based upon the university‚Äôs interest in reducing the opportunity for COVID-19 to spread among people who gather in large public settings.

OSU recognizes that other universities, colleges, K-12 school districts, the state of Oregon and employers may at some time institute other requirements regarding the number of people in attendance at event. We also recognize that CDC guidance on crowd sizes may be different. In OSU‚Äôs case, university leaders believe that the facilities throughout the university can best accommodate our social distancing goals at a maximum of 50 people within OSU-sponsored events.

Information about the university‚Äôs COVID-19 response involving OSU Athletics events will be updated on Thursday, March 12.

Because COVID-19 remains a rapidly developing situation, it is important to check OSU‚Äôs page regularly, as well as advisories and warnings from the [U.S. Department of State](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel.html) and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/) prior to finalizing personal travel plans and undertaking travel.

Please utilize OSU‚Äôs dedicated non-emergency COVID-19 information line, which is available to assist faculty, staff and students with questions at 541-737-7211. You can also seek information through the questions and non-emergency contact form on the [COVID-19 website](https://oregonstate.edu/COVID-19). In the case of a medical emergency, call 911 or a nearby emergency medical facility.

The best preventive measures for COVID-19 and any communicable disease continue to be the practices you undertake as part of your daily routine, especially during flu season:

¬ß  Engage in social distancing;

¬ß  Wash your hands for 20 seconds or more with warm soapy water or use a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol;

¬ß  Avoid sharing anything that has come in contact with another person‚Äôs saliva, whether in your own living or social environments;

¬ß  Cough and sneeze into your elbow or a tissue; then discard the tissue;

¬ß  Get adequate sleep and eat well-balanced meals to support a healthy immune system;

¬ß  If you are not well, remain at home and contact your primary care physician, Student Health Services or a local emergency medical care provider.

During this time of public health concern and changes in OSU‚Äôs operations, please remain mindful and supportive of members of the OSU community who may be more directly affected by the coronavirus situation. Also, it is important that we remain a united community. If you witness any acts of bias or discrimination related to COVID-19, please report them to the [OSU Bias Incident Response](https://diversity.oregonstate.edu/bias-incident-response) team.

Thank you for your understanding and your continued work to keep the OSU community safe and healthy.

Sincerely,

Edward Feser

Provost and Executive Vice President

## Most OSU Corvallis campus fall instruction to be offered remotely and online

Dear OSU faculty and staff,

We write to announce important decisions regarding instruction for the fall term.

Based on careful monitoring of the status of the COVID-19 locally, throughout Oregon and nationally, we have decided that OSU‚Äôs Corvallis campus will deliver most courses remotely in the fall, making it possible for students to live and study from home if that is the best option for them. This approach will limit the density of activity on-campus and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19 among students and employees.

Given OSU-Cascades‚Äô smaller size, the Bend campus will offer a higher complement of fall courses on-site, while also creating remote learning options so that OSU-Cascades students also have a choice of where to live and study. A separate communication that provides information on fall instruction at OSU-Cascades is [available here](https://leadership.oregonstate.edu/speeches-and-statements/osu-cascades-provide-variety-fall-instruction-modalities). The additional details we offer below apply to the Corvallis campus unless noted otherwise.

The decision to deliver instruction primarily virtually on our Corvallis campus was difficult. However, it is fully consistent with the principles we established in our resumption plan, which the Board of Trustees will review on Friday for consistency with guidelines issued by local and state health authorities and the Higher Education Coordinating Commission. While current conditions on our Corvallis campus remain at Level 2 of the university‚Äôs [four public health levels](https://oregonstate.app.box.com/s/tdml14g559oah972olzvwzs46d2e39gk), conditions are trending toward Level 3. Although the path of the virus remains uncertain, students, faculty and staff need clarity regarding fall teaching and operations in order to prepare for the term.

The university‚Äôs COVID-19 [Safety and Success website](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/) and [this video](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_oxupk2bk) offer details on what OSU will look like this fall. The following provides an outline, with a focus on instruction and student life. We will provide additional information on other operations in coming days.

**Choice:** To the greatest extent practicable, we are providing students with the ability to decide the location that works best for them to pursue their OSU studies. If a student feels safest living at home or off-campus and taking OSU courses remotely, almost all of our instruction will support that choice. If they choose to live on campus while they pursue their studies (mostly remotely and online), they are welcome at OSU.

Over 90 percent of OSU Corvallis course sections will be offered remotely. Courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs and field courses. Therefore, some students‚Äîespecially advanced undergraduates and graduate students‚Äîmay need to be in Corvallis in order to take those courses and continue progressing in their degree programs. The [OSU Schedule](https://classes.oregonstate.edu/) of Classes lists the instructional modality or format for each course: on-site/in-person, remote, a blend of on-site/in-person and remote, and online through Ecampus. Regardless of instructional modality, courses will be compelling and engaging, supporting students in achieving their academic goals.

**Living on campus:** Residence halls will be open to students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Capacity will be reduced to offer only single and double occupancy rooms and to create space for use in isolating and quarantining, should it be needed. We have adjusted our First Year Experience Live-on policy so that all first-year students otherwise subject to this policy may make the choice to remain at home. If students elect to stay at home and attend OSU remotely, no exemption request is required. Students with a current UHDS contract who decide to stay home must cancel their contract by emailing [housing@oregonstate.edu](mailto:housing@oregonstate.edu).

Buildings with classrooms and teaching laboratories for in-person instruction and applied learning will be open during fall term, along with the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, buildings that provide students with student services and study spaces, child care, health and wellness, food services and emergency assistance. Advising services will be mostly provided remotely.

**Living near campus.** We know that many students remain in and around Corvallis during the summer months while others will return to the area in order to utilize the university‚Äôs facilities, information technology infrastructure, and support programs while taking remote or online courses. Therefore, the campus will be open under modified conditions to support those students, and we will have public health measures and COVID-19 testing protocols in place. We ask all students, faculty and staff accessing the campus and living in the Corvallis community to be vigilant in adhering to OSU, local and state public health guidelines, and to participate in voluntary virus testing.

**Public health measures:** The multiple public health measures we have implemented include [physical distancing](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-040_COVID19_social_distancing) and [face covering requirements](https://policy.oregonstate.edu/UPSM/04-041_COVID19_face_covering); enhanced cleaning protocols within university buildings; isolation and quarantine rooms in residence halls; improved HVAC filtration, where possible; expanded availability of hand sanitizer; and other public health measures recommended by local and state health officials. These measures are working well and have helped OSU to offer selected programs and services on-site and in-person over the summer.

**On campus testing:** We will test continuously for the prevalence of the virus that causes COVID-19 on the Corvallis and OSU-Cascades campuses and at the Hatfield Marine Science Center with the expert guidance of OSU researchers leading the [TRACE-COVID-19](https://trace.oregonstate.edu/) project. In addition to prevalence testing, we will monitor wastewater on our campuses and at HMSC for the presence of the virus. We are also exploring providing an initial test to students who choose to live on campus in Corvallis and students arriving from out-of-state hotspot communities.

**Financial assistance and student fees:** The OSU Board of Trustees froze tuition rates for the 2020-21 academic year for continuing OSU undergraduates enrolled in Corvallis, Bend, Portland and at Eastern Oregon University; we are increasing need-based financial aid assistance for eligible students; and we are preserving scholarship offers for students who elect to study elsewhere in the fall and return to OSU in a subsequent term. As well, fees associated with Student Fee-funded programs are now under review by student leaders. Information on any student fee reductions will be provided after the student fee committees complete their review.

**Research and Extension.** Campus-based research activities and fieldwork will follow existing resumption [guidelines](https://covid.oregonstate.edu/keep-researching) and on-site OSU Extension activities around the state will take place as local conditions permit.

We certainly had hoped that we would be at a different place in the national battle with COVID-19 by this point in the summer, such that we would be able to return to a significant complement of on-site and in-person instruction for fall term. However, we believe that by shifting to a primarily virtual instructional format, while also offering a limited mix of on-site teaching that facilitates students‚Äô continued progress toward their degree, we will maintain a low density of activity on the Corvallis campus and help minimize the spread of COVID-19. Of course, we are prepared to pivot to fully remote operations if public health considerations dictate such a decision.

We sincerely appreciate the patience and understanding of all members of the OSU community as we adjust to ever-changing pandemic conditions and public health circumstances. Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health and success.

As resilient members of Beaver Nation, we will continue to respond, adapt and recover from these challenging times and become an even stronger community and better university for all we serve.

Sincerely,

F. King Alexander¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†

gk4x2t,SHS Pharmacy is being closed permanently....followed by the entirety of SHS in five years.,76,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonStateUniv/comments/gk4x2t/shs_pharmacy_is_being_closed_permanentlyfollowed/,14,2020-05-15 07:56:40+00:00,Xen0plasm," 

Somebody else posted about this recently, but OSU administration is about to begin drastic reductions to the overall capacity of student health services, starting with the permanent elimination of the SHS pharmacy. *Some people* responded to the other post with some ""spicy"" accusations of phishing attempts....it was not a phishing attempt, and making accusations of such things is very counterproductive in this context. If you lack the patience to wait for someone to verify sources, don't get involved. 

  
Anyway, I ran into one of the SHS pharmacy technicians at Fred Meyer a few days ago. I knew this technician because they helped me acquire travel meds for an internship last year. They told me that the pharmacy was told without warning that they'd be closing at the end of the term. Apparently there was a degree of animosity between Grace Kuo, dean of the College of Pharmacy, and (I think) Jennifer Davis, the director of the SHS pharmacy; according to the technician, the director was defending the pharmacy, and that was one of the reasons she became a scapegoat. Apparently the director offered her resignation in exchange for the promise that the pharmacy would remain active, which was obviously not the case. 

The other piece of information the technician gave to me is that OSU is going to **permanently eliminate Student Health Services and replace it with a privatized service offered by Samaritan Health** in five years. 

Of course, the reasoning for both of these changes boils down to money. Despite that various university sports coaches are still being paid their exhorbitant salaries (even in the absence of actual sporting events), the fact that the SHS Pharmacy helps train students from the College of Pharmacy, and the fact that having a school pharmacy *might help a little during a global pandemic,* the pharmacy is somehow higher on the list for being eliminated.

As far as my source, I have every reason to trust the technician who gave me this information; this technician went above and beyond his duties to help me acquire the medication I needed for my internship last year, and was very honest about the realities of acquiring certain medications in quantity and the probability of my insurance covering them. For sake of protecting their future job prospects, I am not going to identify the technician; they are one of [the staff members listed at the bottom of this webpage](https://studenthealth.oregonstate.edu/pharmacy), and that is the furthest I am willing to go. 

I don't know what  to do about this, and I probably don't have time to help very much with it. The only real idea I have for confronting this is that some of the organizations that help fund the College of Pharmacy might not like to find out that the school is getting rid of their own pharmacy to save money instead of pulling funds out of their expensive sports programs. The SHS pharmacy is a very direct means of training students who want to become pharmacists, and it's hard to frame the loss of the pharmacy as anything other than a loss to the students in the College of Pharmacy, and to the university as a whole. 

I don't know if it would work, but if someone could demonstrate to the organization(s) providing funding to the College of Pharmacy that OSU has degraded the functionality to the college for the sake of saving money, it might make the donors/grant committees a little unhappy.",fqozhqb,[deleted],28.0,None,fqppsng,"As far as your lengthy post goes, I'll only comment to this part: "" *If you lack the patience to wait for someone to verify sources, don't get involved*.""

You are right: wait until there is an official announcement regarding this question. Until then your post is nothing more than just fear-mongering, speculation, and gossip. It doesn't serve any other purposes than sparking an argument about what might happen in the future, what might OSU do, and how athletic jobs are still being paid the same way (which, I'm sure, is because of their contracts -- you can't just violate a valid contract and not pay them without mutual agreement...).

They tried to get the city council to pass a ""law"" limiting everyone who lives in town and has been following the rules. City council said ""our PD does not have the resources to be the party patrol"" and makes it a 'recommendation' instead. 

Why did OSU invite thousands of students to live on (and off) campus? Money > health. Same as ever, they put the burden of solving hard problems on the City of Corvallis (housing comes to mind).

It's still a shit situation for the university though, for example they have cut the salary of every employee making above $50k (the rate of cutting increases with salary up to 12% at $222k) because they have a projected defecit of $50 million this year.

On the other side, the Corvallis economy would not be nearly what it is without the university (obviously). If no students came back, many businesses would need to close permanently (and might still from what I've been reading).

Not saying ANYTHING justifies OSU's piss poor response to the situation, just highlighting that it is a nuanced issue.

Winter term plans for the OSU-Cascades campus will be announced by Oct. 15. 
 
We will continue to use remote delivery to contribute to student wellness and educational success, limit the density of activity on-campus and in the Corvallis community, and help minimize the possible spread of COVID-19. As with fall term, courses offered on-site will primarily be those that have a heavy experiential learning component, such as labs, field courses and some graduate courses.
 
By the time registration opens in mid-November, the OSU Schedule of Classes will list the instructional modality for each course, as determined in consultation with academic units. Our aim is to limit the need for students to change where they live based on how winter term courses are offered.
 
We plan to have the following building open on the Corvallis campus during winter term: those with classrooms and teaching laboratories used for in-person instruction and applied learning, UHDS residence halls and dining centers, the Memorial Union, Dixon Recreation Center, Valley Library, and other buildings that provide child care, Student Health Services, food services, emergency assistance and study spaces (such as LInC). OSU updates the open/closed buildings list regularly. Student advising will continue to be provided mostly remotely.
 
Residence halls will continue to be open for students who decide that living on campus is their best and safest option. Students who chose to remain in their home community during fall term but wish to live on campus for winter and spring terms are welcome to live on campus. Visit University Housing & Dining Services‚Äô or email housing@oregonstate.edu.
 
As we plan for spring term, we will closely monitor COVID-19 conditions and if possible, provide increased in-person instruction, extra-curricular and experiential learning opportunities for students. We will communicate more details on spring term as winter term is underway.
 
Winter term tuition and fees will be the same as fall term. Student fees for the academic year will be based upon recommendations from student leaders in Corvallis and at OSU-Cascades.
 
Thank you in advance for remaining flexible and adaptable as we continue to prioritize your health, safety and educational success. Thank you for being a resilient and responsible member of Beaver Nation.
 
Sincerely,
 
F. King Alexander

I‚Äôm not going to comment on if she deserved to be arrested in the first place, but thinking that there was any racial injustice here or police overreaction is ignorant and simply incorrect, imo.

@23:00

> can I sit up?

> sure.

*officer helps lift her up*

>I can get up by myself!

> no you aren‚Äôt.

> let me get up by myself

> no. Stop or you aren‚Äôt getting up.

> okay I‚Äôd rather lay down.

*she repeats this a bit*

*officers lay her down on her stomach*

> please let me sit up by myself

> no.

*conversation is repeated a few times*

*women again says she will not answer questions, just like she‚Äôs been saying since the beginning of the video*

> can you stop touching me?

*officer continues to hold on to her arm with the one hand*
> no. 

> can you stop touching me? It‚Äôs making uncomfortable.

*officer releases her*

> can I sit up?

> no.

*moves a bit, can‚Äôt tell if she‚Äôs trying to get up or not*

> don‚Äôt try to get up.

*women calls out to bystanders, asking for someone to send their mother a ‚Äúvideo or something‚Äù. Phone numbers(multiple, because she gives the incorrect phone number first) are bleeps out.*

*3rd officer arrives to keep back the bystanders that keep walking up behind the officer with the women*.

*women again asks to sit up a few times. Officer again denies the request.*

*4th officer arrives. First officer explains why she is under arrest to the officer, and the 2nd officer tells the 4th officer to be mindful of the cuffs, because they were put on very lightly/softly, since he didn‚Äôt want to hurt her wrists.*

*there are more than just 4 officers now, but 5 and 6 don‚Äôt seem to do anything.*

*4th officer notifies the arrested women she is here to do the search, because she is a female officer.*

> can I stand up?

> I would like you to get up.

*again, officers hold her as she gets up, and again, she protests being touched(however, she only calls out against the male, not the female officer)*

*again, asks to not be touched. Officer has to tell her that, since she is in custody, she won‚Äôt be waking on her own.*

To me, it seems like the main issue is the women both didn‚Äôt want to speak to the police(which is perfectly legal, but you can be detained for this. However, there is nothing wrong with someone enacting their right to be silent or following [STFU Friday](https://youtu.be/JTurSi0LhJs)) and also constantly spoke out about being detained. 

If she had answered the original questions, she *probably* wouldn‚Äôt have been detained(see the beginning of this comment for the quotes about why she was arrested). Maybe identifying herself somehow would have notified the police that she was dangerous or wanted, but I doubt it. Also, if she hadn‚Äôt attempted to stand up on her own and then explicitly stated she would ‚Äúrather lay down‚Äù, she would have been sitting normally on the curb, which would have been much more comfortable(emotionally, I don‚Äôt mean feel better sitting on a hard curb than laying in grass).

Are their any requirements or other guidelines on what sort of experience or background (etc) for teachers/instructors/professors?

I thought we were paying for (at the very least) and getting a quality education but at the same time I have had teachers that are using material from 10 + (+++?) years ago and others that have absolutely no experience, education or any apparent relevant background in topics that they are teaching. How is this acceptable?

What about material that is relevant to the world today (not outdated)?

Do you find this to be true as well?Do you find this to be disheartening?

What can be done about it?

In reality we are the customer/client paying OSU et all for an education but why is it that we have no say in the quality of this education?

\*\*Edit: This is not a direct reference to experience due to COVID, this has been and ongoing problem since before COVID.",fvoq9rw,"As a faculty member at OSU working to try to fix some of these problems, you have my sincere sympathy. 

There are many structural challenges, but one of the largest in my opinion is the focus on research: the university hires tenure track professors so that they will bring research funding to increase revenue (OSU charges overhead on any grants they bring in). Yet part of their position is also to teach - the idea is that since they're doing research, they can also teach the subject effectively. Sadly, this is a false assumption. Most professors are not taught how to teach, which is surprising because the results of research on teaching and learning are easy enough to incorporate in most cases. Additionally, if they don't bring in enough funding, they may either not receive their salary, or they may be turned down for tenure, which is basically a seven-year test that you can rarely get the chance to try and take again. This makes many prioritize their research over everything else.

What ends up happening to may professors is that they try to fumble through their first few classes. It doesn't go well. They get horrible evals, and then blame students for being lazy or disinterested. 

But, you can advocate for yourself. Leave very descriptive comments in your course evals. And sign them! Contact the associate Dean or Dean of the college and complain. You are a consumer. Make sure people know you are not satisfied with their product. You can also try talking to the person directly, but many are defensive and assume the problem is on your end. 

Again, some of us are working to try and fix this, but it's an uphill battle. It's also not the only problem, of course. But it's funny: shouldn't we be somewhat responsible for student success?",61.0,Dr_Gonzoh,fvotoax,"One of the things that also sucks when trying to deal with quality issues is that the college is so huge, the student community will have wildly different experiences. So some advocating for change may be speaking to students fortunate enough to have only had great teachers. 

I second the other commenter‚Äôs advice to speak up and be heard, but not only directly to OSU, but to other students! Whether it‚Äôs here, ratemyprofessor, or just talking to underclassmen or other people in your area of study about good/bad instructors or experiences. It‚Äôs been helpful to me to hear some of the recommendations of my upperclassmen. Then, sharing strategies of how to deal with poor teaching / curriculum, as the other commenter mentioned, through signed evals, contacting deans, contacting the instructor, or setting up personal methods to counteract their weak spots.

To address our unprecedented global and immediate need for access to reading and research materials, as of today, March 24, 2020, the Internet Archive will suspend waitlists for the 1.4 million (and growing) books in our lending library by creating a National Emergency Library to serve the nation's displaced learners. This suspension will run through June 30, 2020, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.
During the waitlist suspension, users will be able to borrow books from the National Emergency Library without joining a waitlist, ensuring that students will have access to assigned readings and library materials that the Internet Archive has digitized for the remainder of the US academic calendar, and that people who cannot physically access their local libraries because of closure or self-quarantine can continue to read and thrive during this time of crisis, keeping themselves and others safe.

How about the out-of-state students who will now be paying $685 a credit to sit at their desks at home? What about in-state students who will now be teaching themselves much of the curriculum independent of on-campus resources? What about lab classes? I don't think my lab class in the spring has the capability to be taught remotely, aside from lectures.

To say that it's fair to charge this much for remote teaching ""Because it's not ecampus"" is ridiculous. Our community is working so hard to provide so much for its citizens and yet nothing has been done to help with tuition forgiveness/extension.

Are there any other students who are frustrated about this? In my case, I can't even go home because I'm from Washington, and the majority of the out-of-state students here are from California and Washington.

&#x200B;

I'm just thinking of contacting my department head over this and I want to see if there are any other students who find this unfair. My partner and I are both out of jobs now (he is a chef in town, I work at the creamery on campus) and thinking that I'll end up paying 10-12k for spring term  *at my desk* is only adding more stress onto everything going on right now.",fl1qt3c,"If you decrease tuition, it means the university needs to decrease as expenses.

Most of what our tuition goes towards is people. Sure, if you‚Äôre not on campus this term you‚Äôre not seeing as much direct value.  But if OSU fires/(let‚Äôs go) someone this term they won‚Äôt be back in the fall. 

You can bet your ass that IT and library staff are working twice as hard to get remote teaching done, otherwise you‚Äôd be starting at a blank screen. And do you think our professors or instructors are getting paid more for more work? Nope.

Remote classes are not Ecampus classes. This whole situation is far from ideal. OSU should actually be paying their employees more for doing more work (which would mean raising tuition, so they aren‚Äôt doing that).

They let us save $4k by moving out of dorms, for those of us who are in dorms. They just implemented that scholarship thing so if anyone was on track to graduate and now is not, costs will be covered.

A couple friends and I have been coordinating randomized Zoom lunches to help students meet each other responsibly during quarantine. As what we've been doing has picked up interest, we wanted to share it with the OSU community as well. If you'd like to make new friends from different backgrounds and universities, fill out the form linked below and we'll group you with 3 random students over email for remote lunch. We currently have attendees from Boulder, UCSD, Berkeley, U-Dub, and more and we hope you'll consider joining us for furthest distance lunch too. Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions!

gtpbyn,Fall term thoughts,40,https://www.reddit.com/r/OregonStateUniv/comments/gtpbyn/fall_term_thoughts/,28,2020-05-31 00:34:29+00:00,lalala032020,"I‚Äôve been thinking about Fall term, the email they sent out this past week, and discussions from classes & on reddit. It seems like many of us are thinking the same thing. OSU is announcing of some classes in person to keep enrollment from plummeting. Now the thing is, I do think they are trying their best to keep classes on campus. But in reality, I think it‚Äôs risky to bring back thousands of people from all over back to Corvallis. The 8 week term idea is great. I always found the weeks in between thanksgiving and finals to be quite awkward. But I‚Äôm sure they know that with a influx of people returning to Corvallis, there‚Äôll be people celebrating/catching up at bars(if they open) and quite a bit of parties, especially in the first couple of weeks. It‚Äôll be hard to enforce social distancing when people haven‚Äôt seen their friends in months & with many living in the same house. So I‚Äôm curious to see how that will be handled. I mean, I‚Äôm all for people living their lives, but for those who are trying to be safe and cautious, it‚Äôs going to be hard.

I feel bad for the incoming Freshmen. They‚Äôre signing up for most, if not all, of their classes being online since they‚Äôll be taking prerequisites with way more than 50 people in the class. It sucks that OSU is still encouraging dorming knowing that most of their classes will be online. If I was an incoming freshmen, I would start at CC this fall & transfer when classes are back to on campus normally. 

Based off my own class schedule for the Fall, I‚Äôm only on campus for a couple days a week as most of the lectures are already scheduled to be delivered remotely. But, personally, I find it quite annoying that I‚Äôm only going to campus for a recitation and a lab. I find it more annoying because these classes can be done remotely. I guess it‚Äôs just that I have to fly back to Oregon for 8 weeks & go to campus for 2-3 days just for lab and recitation. I know it‚Äôs my choice to do so, but if I don‚Äôt, then I push off graduating next spring. 

I feel like a lot of people are going to be in similar positions. Lectures are going to be 
delivered remotely, but recitation and labs will be on campus. What are your thoughts or concerns? I‚Äôm curious as to what others are thinking.",fsdjh36,You don't have to be in Corvallis at all in the fall. They already announced that even classes that are held in-person will have a remote option for people that want to stay in their hometowns.,27.0,None,fsdimsa,I think they will give us an option to learn remotely if we cannot or do not want to go back on campus in the fall for safety reasons. I am probably not going to rent housing for the fall since it would be ridiculous to live on campus to just attend one class for me.,18.0,SugaKookieMonsta,fsebc8m,I am sad for incoming students on just about every level. If I were a fresh or soph I would do everything I could at a CC until I couldn't do more. Doing the 'four year experience' on campus has never made less sense. The school's (you can say this about every US school) over reliance on international students is a the 'chickens have come home to roost' moment.,12.0,epicrepairetime

Have had to email my advisor and professors for the last 5 or so terms to get the shit I need to graduate. Don't accept so many students if you don't have seat space for them. Money grubbing bastards at OSU,f82e2jv,"At least we are better than places like University of Washington. They can accept you into the university, but not into the college, so you‚Äôll only be able to take baccalaureate course. You‚Äôd think if ‚Äútoo many students‚Äù was an issue, the solution would be adding more professors or expanding class sizes/number of sections.

As OSU themselves say...

> In addition, our enrollments have grown.  In order to preserve the student experience at Oregon State, a more competitive admissions process ‚Äì including the use of a waitlist, is necessary.

Hmmmm, yes, because the current university student experience is very well-loved. Can‚Äôt possibly change that...",15.0,Gcarsk,f83mcos,[deleted],8.0,None,f828sol,What type of engineering major are you?,2.0,domosaurusrex13
