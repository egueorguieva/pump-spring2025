Previously Ive always wanted a specialist education. Every course, or at least 95% of it has to be directly related to my major. This seems to be what Oxford offers. 

Compared to the Oxford course for the same major, how much less content is covered in the Williams course? Is Oxford more rigorous than Williams coursework? 

If I want to double major, is Williams a good place? ",m33nlel,"One good way to describe a liberal arts education from Williams College is that they have a goal to give you as much of the breadth of knowledge that humanity had amassed over several thousand years in 4 years. This prepares you very well for graduate programs. 
You will have strength in your major(s) of choice, as well as many depths of knowledge to pull from as well.",5.0,Bullonsax,m3gi5nq,"Every person comes back from WEPO and says that the education at Oxford PALES in comparison to Williams. And, at Williams, you can choose to go to Oxford!

Williams also offers the ability to both get super deep into one thing, or go broad and learn a bit of everything.",4.0,ButterflyOutside1085,m32b3cp,"At Williams, the only requirement is that you complete three courses in each academic division: division I (humanities), division II (social sciences), and division III (STEM). You also need to complete two writing intensives, one quantitative, and one diversity/culturally centered class. 

Majors usually require around 9 credits (you earn 32 over eight semesters when taking a regular course load). Over your first two years, you can take no more than 5 classes of the same course prefix. So, if you wanted to take as many classes in your major as possible (let‚Äôs assume that this hypothetical major has no requirements outside the major), then you‚Äôd be able to take 21 out of 32 courses in your major (5 + 8 + 8), or around 66% of your classes. 

That‚Äôs the minimum, of course, as some majors like computer science (and physics iirc) have a math requirement, and others like language majors require some history/social component that may be taken outside of the major department‚Äôs prefix (i.e., a history class relating to the USSR might be cross listed as RUSS and HIST), which gets around the early concentration limits.

The systems for Oxford and Williams are very different, with Oxford offering 3 year degrees and Williams offering 4 year degrees. Some degrees offered at Oxford are not offered at Williams and vice versa; the biggest difference you will find is that Oxford graduates will be more employable in the UK while Williams graduates will be more employable in the US. I have heard that Williams and Oxford are comparable in terms of rigor, but someone who has done WEPO would be better suited to answer that.

If you wanted to, it is entirely possible to triple major at Williams if you planned it well. Double majoring is extremely common, or even having a major and two minors. The magic of a liberal arts college like Williams is that there is much room to explore a variety of topics in as much depth as you‚Äôd like to (short of graduate-level courses, excluding art history).",3.0,Solivont

I've just applied ED to Williams. Hope I get in. One thing I'd like to know is the housing options.

How does one go about applying for a particular kind of housing if that's possible?",lvefsif,"freshman here‚Äîi‚Äôm in a double (as are most freshmen) but singles aren‚Äôt super hard to come by. about 2/3? of freshmen (including me) live in one of the two identical buildings in frosh quad that are almost all doubles with a couple singles, and the rest live in mission which is all singles, but like the other commenter said mission might be converted into upperclassmen housing next year. i really like frosh quad‚Äîit‚Äôs pretty much the perfect location and the buildings are quite pretty compared to mission, which is fugly and a little out of the way and at the bottom of a hill. mission does have larger/nicer common rooms and its own dining hall (not open every day) though so it‚Äôs also a good option. williams also seems to do a very good job with roommates‚Äîi‚Äôm very friendly with mine and i haven‚Äôt heard of anyone who really doesn‚Äôt get along with theirs. lmk if you have any other questions",1.0,kOOLandEdJy,m43ruz1,"In regards to your question about applying for a particular kind of housing, you fill out a form early in the summer where you rank the 4 options: single in frosh quad, double in frosh quad, single in mission, double in mission. 

Single in frosh quad is the most difficult to get. No one wants a double in mission. 

I somewhat agree with the comment that Williams does a good job with roommates, however a lot of my friends unfortunately didn‚Äôt luck out. That‚Äôs why I tried to get a single in frosh as my first choice and single in mission as my second choice. I felt a single was best for me to assimilate into college without having to worry about roommate issues. But of course to each their own as having a roommate is a vital aspect of experiencing college life. I‚Äôm sure as a sophomore I‚Äôll end up in a double unless I somehow get a single (which is uncommon for upperclassmen).

I‚Äôm currently in mission as a freshman and although the hill sometimes is a drag, it really isn‚Äôt all that bad. The dining hall is such a plus, during finals week when it was cold I didn‚Äôt have to venture outside, and mission brunch on the weekends is the best dining the school offers tbh. Also mission has hundreds of rooms, it‚Äôs 4 floors of just singles (there‚Äôs maybe a handful of doubles thrown in) so you are definitely not alone. The mission common rooms are super nice (much better than frosh quad in my opinion) and my entry (this is what we call ppl in your ‚Äúhall‚Äù) loves spending time together on the couches watching tv etc. It really makes up for the extra 2 min walk down the Mission Hill lol. I personally can‚Äôt speak for the frosh quad environment but from what I‚Äôve heard they‚Äôre also super friendly with each other and get along in their entries. You‚Äôll have a great time no matter what.

My state senator went to Williams and when talking to her offered to write me a rec letter and do a interview with me for the school (I don‚Äôt think they can do that though). I originally had my heart set on Hamilton and I still like it a lot but after touring Williams the other day, I fell in love with everything about it. I am a Questbridge applicant so if I become a finalist it‚Äôs out of my hands (Williams will be ranked #1 and Hamilton #2 probably. Might change rankings but other schools will be ranked as well) but if I don‚Äôt become a finalist which I am expecting to happen, how should I go about applying to Williams? Hamilton has been very clear about wanting students that want to be there badly and I‚Äôve heard people who love it there, but Williams was mind blowing and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have good stats everywhere else but I didn‚Äôt do as well on my ACT as I was hoping which is giving me a hard choice over what to do for ED. I have safeties planned out but I‚Äôm nervous one action I take will mess up the other and any advice or suggestions at all would be greatly appreciated.

Here are my stats:

Low Income (Indian-White) Student in high income academic area

Parents are seperated/Father is absent

Oldest of 4 siblings 

4.0 Unweighted GPA (94.5/100)

No class rank

27 ACT (debating on test optional need advice)

I have 143 CS Hours, NHS, CPR/First AID Certification, Cum Laude on the National Latin Exam, and a few other local awards

10 APs (5s in World and USH, 4s in Lang and Psych)

3 Jobs through the YMCA to support my Family and be involved in the community (Camp Counselor, Child Watch Assistant, and After School Care provider) 

Youth Ambassador for the NYS Youth Mental Health Advisory Board where I advocate, research, and campaign for youth mental health which has resulted in me writing and contributing towards bills set to pass in NYS regarding mental health in education and schools (My state Senator who runs the board went to Williams and offered to write me a Rec Letter for Williams, she‚Äôs awesome)

President of a School Teaching Club where I teach students how to design curriculums, organize and shadow teachers for classroom experience, meet with school officials at other districts, organize school supplies drives for low income students (I don‚Äôt know how much $ we raise in supplies but we get a lot), earned the club a program with Nazareth University for teaching, etc.

Advisory of a Military History Club where me and a teacher organize and design interactive Risk like battle simulation board games for members to learn about Military History and Strategy through fun ways

I did Rowing for 2 years (would do club if possible)

I have a Animation portfolio that has earned a few school art awards and a spot in the RIT Start Here exhibition

Member of Red Cross Club, Pre Med Club, GSA, etc. (probably some other stuff I‚Äôm forgetting)

TL;DR: what should I do based off of my stats if I don‚Äôt match for Questbridge. Should I ED to Williams, Hamilton, RD or something else? Do I go Test Optional? Am I decent enough to have a shot at Williams? Any advice at all would be Incredible 


",lplo5t9,"I applied to Hamilton when I was a senior in high school, too. If I had to do it all over again, I would still choose Williams in a heartbeat. Thus, I do recommend making Williams your first choice on the QuestBridge application. If you do not match on QuestBridge, apply ED to Williams if you are sure it is the place. Should it come down to it, definitely apply RD to Williams as well (with 3 applications in the most unfortunate  case, along with everything else in the profile, I am quite confident of your chances).

Regarding your profile, as long as you write a compelling essay and spin a coherent narrative that ties all your acitivities together, I believe you have a great shot with Williams.

Regarding the ACT score, without sugarcoating it, 27 is low compared to those who submit their scores to Williams. I do not know the number for the ACT, but the uppermost quartile of those submitting SAT scores to Williams last cycle achieved 1570‚Äîan ACT 35 or 36. Granted, this statistic is biased, as those with exceptional scores tend to submit theirs, while those performing under their expectations do not. If I were you, I would not include my score when applying to Williams and may retake the test to aim for a 32.

I do want to expand the context of test scores in relation to how rigorous Williams is, as another commenter also noted. A lot of colleges all over the country have reinstated test requirements because recent research shows that standardized test results closely predict academic performance (other standardized tests and GPA) in college. In my opinion, rather than because the test ACT, SAT, or AP teaches you something amazing, it is because good test takers go on to be good test takers and because such students often come from privileged backgrounds.

However, I have seen first-hand how this statistic plays out in reality. Some of my peers from less privileged backgrounds and with less ‚Äúideal stats‚Äù do struggle with classes‚Äîeven when they are incredibly intelligent and the very best at their high schools. Especially in freshman year, it is easy for low-income students to feel like they ‚Äúfall behind‚Äù or ‚Äújust do not get it.‚Äù Of course, everyone should be welcomed at Williams, and no one should doubt themselves. Sadly, this does happen, and happens disproportionately to low-income students. 

The conclusion of this winded discussion on test scores and college dynamics is this: try your best to improve your ACT score if you can (since the cost of the test might be prohibitive). Improve yourself academically constantly, even after you get into Williams (knock on wood!).

Good luck.

TL;DR: YES.

Obviously, I am only a few weeks into the semester and I feel very satisfied with how busy I am. I‚Äôm just starting to join clubs now, but I see my current weeks filled very modestly and healthily (with a variety of activities, many beyond studying). If you‚Äôre looking for things you might be interested in like clubs and other organizations, I‚Äôd look at the [Registered Student Organizations List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bu1NVmrGJVW2BrDfpLBt3qo3wmWLjvFTnBhP5I6TRx4/edit).

And from what I have seen, everyone encourages you to explore your hobbies and get the most out of life here. I find that students are simultaneously athletes, artists, academics and, overall, really rather awesome. 

Beyond regular club and social group activities, most organizations host some type of general student life activity‚Äî like a boba night or an apple cider pressing event. The college wants students to take pride in having fun at stuff like this, so I find they‚Äôre regularly available. 

And as for being an international student, I have met so many people already that come from a wide and diverse collection of places. In fact, 11.3% of my current class is international [(more cool data like that here‚Äî a prime example of one of our student organizations in action!)](https://williamsrecord.com/467282/news/first-year-demographics-shift-slightly-following-affirmative-action-ban/).

I‚Äôm currently a high school senior and plan to major in pure math with the goal of eventually pursuing a PhD. Since I‚Äôve maxed out my high school math courses, I‚Äôm currently taking linear algebra and abstract algebra at a nearby university.

I‚Äôm mainly focusing on applying to R1 universities (for Fall 2025) that offer opportunities to take graduate-level courses and explore various advanced math topics.

I‚Äôve heard great things about studying math at Williams College, but I still have a few unresolved questions. If you are (or were) a pure math major at Williams, I‚Äôd really appreciate your insights.

Here are a few things I‚Äôve learned from reaching out to faculty (in plain text), but I‚Äôd love to hear your experiences (my questions are in bold text):

1. Williams offers 400-level (also known as senior seminar) courses that are similar to graduate classes. These courses change every semester, ensuring that students always have access to upper-level classes. **What was your experience taking 400-level courses as an undergraduate? Were you able to explore different areas of math? Were there enough class offerings?**
2. Williams provides opportunities to conduct original research with faculty, which can lead to publications. **Have you written any papers that were published with a reputable organization (as an undergraduate)?**
3. Research opportunities and thesis work are primarily available through Williams‚Äô summer program (SMALL). **I understand that students from other colleges also participate in SMALL. Does Williams reserve a certain number of spots for its own students? What was your experience with the SMALL program?**

I also would like to mention that I prefer attending classes with other students so that we can exchange ideas. For now, I‚Äôm not particularly interested in pursuing independent study to self-learn a math topic.

Lastly, when I toured Williams in February 2024, we passed through a building where math classes were being held (I can‚Äôt remember the name). What struck me as odd was that most of the classrooms were empty, and the two classes that were in session had only about six students each. Is this typical?",lmgn0tm,"I wasn't a math major (chemistry for me), but I can tell you that a lot of (most?) students who do research end up with at least one scholarly publication. Sometimes it comes out after you graduate because the research can take several years of work and because the time from submission of a paper to publication can be several months. (For example, the paper I was on was submitted in the latter part of my senior year and came out the next academic year. The other student on the paper graduated the year before I did, so it was two years after graduation for her.)

I spent two summers on campus doing research and interacted with many SMALL students. At that time, at least half (maybe more) were Williams students. The math department is very strong at Williams, so there were a lot of students interested in SMALL.

As for class sizes, most are small, even the calc 1/2 classes. Calc 1/2 were broken up into sections. The highest I took was differential equations. All those classes were maybe 12-20 students. The only big math class I had was multivarible calc, and that was a big lecture-hall type class. However it was probably only about 40-50 students, but I was so used to small classes that I thought it was huge.",8.0,MiniLaura,lmgxhac,"Hi there! 

I am a current student who was also advanced in math as a high schooler (took two semesters of abstract algebra and intro grad level topics courses), and am interested in math grad school!

Topics offered at the 300 and 400 level are varied and interesting, although pretty slow for me (varying from 50 to 90 percent the pace of their grad-level equivalents, with some of the faster courses being complex analysis and Fourier analysis in the math department, and some deep courses in physics as well with a lot of connections to higher level math, eg gravity). That being said, there is significant precedent for people in your situation in math studying away for 1-2 semesters at research institutions (mostly Harvard and Berkeley) in order to fill out their knowledge prior to math grad school! There are also math colloquia, clubs, independent study, and senior thesis (although this is quite far away) to supplement the math you learn in courses.

In summary, you would not be the only person in this situation; dm me if you want more info.

(I will say that for someone intending on speedrunning a math phd you might have a better time at an R1 uni, but Williams has many of its own advantages as I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre aware, ESPECIALLY if you have pretty much any additional interests outside of math).

I didn‚Äôt go the research route, but I had a couple of friends write theses that either were published or are in the process of being published.

1) I'm worried about the small size of the school - I attend a high school (<100 per grade), and feel incredibly stifled by the size. I understand that, obviously 100 -> 500 is a big jump, so it totally may not apply, but if anyone who is a current student can speak to that please let me know! Especially given the rural location

2) I'm lowkey worried that everyone is so locked in to studying that the social scene is not very good - I'm not a big partier, but also would like to have some fun/not spend my weekends studying the whole time - do I need to worry about this?

3) From what I've read, the perception of Williams is kind of a jock-y culture. While I'm not very into sports, I am fairly outdoorsy - I guess I'm just wondering if not being into sports would be a detriment to my experience?

All the faculty in the department are fantastic both as scholars and people. Population varies by year but it tends to be a small major, albeit with a lot of non-majors taking classes, especially those who had Latin or Greek in prep school. I'm now in humanities grad school and using the Greek skills I built at Williams every day for my courses and dissertation research, so I would say it served me well, although I also know people who went on to law, finance, consulting, or even med school by taking the requisite courses on the side or double-majoring.

  
The curriculum varies a bit depending on if you want to focus on Greek, Latin, or content-courses (note that either way you'll take 4 semesters in at least one of Greek or Latin). I did a Greek-focused path so I took Greek pretty much every semester my last 3 years, with some Latin and Classical studies mixed in.

  
As for comparing it to other majors, it depends on what you're considering, but I'll reiterate that double or even triple majoring with Classics is possible. WIth all humanities I will say you are best majoring in them if you're actually interested in them, but if you are, the major will be a deeply enriching experience and ultimately help you get where you want to go.

The department is also among the most generous with funding for fellowships, etc. As far as curriculum, there are two paths towards the major -- one which emphasizes language courses in either Latin or Greek, and another with more coursework in classical studies (culture, history, literature in translation). Even if you take the classical studies route, you can expect to take a fair amount of Latin/Greek, and the language courses are intense (especially at the intro level) but very rewarding. At the intermediate and advanced levels, you typically read a text in the original Greek/Latin. Discussions and assessments focus mostly on content, so they are basically literature classes, but you are learning a lot of grammar along the way.

Unlike at many other colleges, anyone who wants a single is pretty much guaranteed to have one for three out of four years. Some people have singles freshman year and maybe a double with a good friend sophomore year. Others are placed in a double freshman year. Others get singles both years. Nobody ever has to have a double as a junior or senior.

Housing is guaranteed for all four years, unlike at some colleges where you have to find a rental at some point. And almost everyone lives in a college-owned building for all four years.

Everyone has an equal shot at a great room or a crappy room, unlike some colleges where rich kids can buy better places than poor kids. It is a lottery for everyone after freshman year. 

And the freshman entry concept is really cool- a built-in ‚Äòfamily‚Äô of sorts for your first year!

Trade offs. IMO, more than worth it for the amazing educational experience. Just don‚Äôt expect luxurious living conditions!",15.0,Wordwoman50,llelh16," Mission is much nicer than any other college‚Äôs dorms, and so are the other freshman dorms. In detail, there are a minifridge and microwave in every room, along with a comfortable twin size bed. However, no ACs across the college.",8.0,hth1hth1,llhbg2m,"The worst dorms at Williams are better than at other schools, the best dorms aren‚Äôt as nice as at other schools. They‚Äôre all sort of average, with differences in location/room size/common rooms. There‚Äôs no AC anywhere, but that really doesn‚Äôt matter other than during the summer and maybe first week of the fall.

One thing to know: Williams advertises their freshman housing a lot. For example: 50% of our first year students are in singles! That‚Äôs true, but what they don‚Äôt tell you is that almost 100% of sophomores are in doubles and have the worst housing on campus. This surprises a lot of people when their sophomore housing is a downgrade from freshman year.

Housing is a lottery, but it‚Äôs not all that fair. It changes a bit every year, HCs (like RAs at other colleges) and students with housing accommodations get to choose where to live and pull in multiple friends. TAPSI (affinity/special interest housing) takes over entire NICE dorms. What I‚Äôm saying is, the best housing is taken before the lottery even opens! If you‚Äôre interested in a TAPSI house though, definitely go for it. More and more get added every year!

I generally was pretty lucky and liked where I ended up living, and loved my freshman entry. The worst issue I dealt with in four years was mice, but that ended up going away! I hope this gives you a detailed and honest perspective on housing at Williams.",8.0,ComprehensiveBill820

1expskv,"Opinions on Williams College or any other college with 3-2 program with Columbia, because not many students decide to do this. Is it beneficial in the long run when getting a masters in engineering or applying for jobs. Is it just better to stay at Williams because it is such an amazing network and ",7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/1expskv/opinions_on_williams_college_or_any_other_college/,9,2024-08-21 13:34:28+00:00,Longjumping-Can-139,College,lj936w0,"If I had to take a guess, the reason why not many people decide to do 3-2 or 4-2 programs between liberal arts colleges and research universities is simple: space, cost, and time.

These 3-2 and 4-2 programs often have limited seating and network with an array of institutions; Williams offers this 3-2 in conjunction with Columbia, but Columbia almost certainly has a similar pathway set up with several other colleges as well. You still have to go through an admissions process and meet all prerequisites to participate in programs like this.

An additional two years of college isn‚Äôt free, either. Whether you pursue the 3-2 or the 4-2 pathway, that‚Äôs one to two years more you‚Äôd have to pay, and not necessarily at the same rates you‚Äôd been paying at your home institution. For many people, an extra year or two of tuition (an extra year or two of loans) isn‚Äôt worth receiving two bachelor‚Äôs degrees, especially when Williams (and other top LAC) graduates are already on track to graduate with a degree that performs well in the job market (and among graduate schools).

Time is the last general factor that comes to mind. Think of it this way: if you graduate with your bachelor‚Äôs in Physics and pursue a master‚Äôs im engineering immediately after, you‚Äôll be spending five to six years (more or less) on earning these two degrees. You‚Äôd be spending the same amount of time by doing a 3-2 or 4-2 program, but instead of a bachelor‚Äôs and a master‚Äôs, you‚Äôd be coming away with two bachelor‚Äôs. Regardless of how many bachelor‚Äôs you have, some jobs will still require or prefer candidates to have a master‚Äôs degree. For jobs that require or prefer a bachelor‚Äôs, well, you already had that box checked a year or two ago.

Whether or not these programs provide an admissions benefit to master‚Äôs programs, I can‚Äôt say. If you‚Äôre a physics major who has taken advantage of opportunities available (academic year research, summer research, internships, etc) then I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm inclined to believe that an extra bachelor‚Äôs degree would give you a significant benefit in graduate admissions.

The last thing I‚Äôll mention regarding these 3-2 and 4-2 programs is that, like you speculate about in your question, Williams *does* have a strong community and alumni network. According to the Williams website on their 3-2/4-2 program with Columbia, many students who are admitted to the program ultimately choose not to participate in it because of the community at Williams, both during and after your years there.

If you have three classes and have been dropped, it‚Äôs then that you would have to look at the catalog to find another class that‚Äôs still open to register for tomorrow during your time slot.

and I hope to connect with an alumni from the uni, it's preferred to be international student . ",leqnz8j,"Research: Could maybe get started by winter study or spring of your 1st year but more realistically the summer between 1st/2nd. Applying is very informal and more so about knowing a prof well enough to ask them to get involved, but there's plenty of research. Especially great if you want to go PhD route.

Internships: Can apply to all the regular internships offered by big companies but Williams also has a list of alumni-sponsored internship programs (ASIP) and up to a few grand of a fund for internships (think travel, rent, food, etc.). If you don't do an internship it's probably because you didn't want one, they're very feasible to get.

Courses: If you had prior CS course experience, you start with CSCI 136 (data structures and algorithms), if not you take CSCI 134 (intro to CS) which is very very overenrolled, meaning that if you don't get the course your fall semester you're guaranteed to get it your spring semester. As with any uni, CS courses focus on theory especially the higher up you go, so it's up to you to grind leetcode, etc. 

Major: Around 120 junior/senior declared majors, you'll definitely meet people in your courses to study/hang out with. Also very underrated but TA opportunities are available for CS almost any department, which is fairly unique to LACs like Williams.

Super excited that you are considering the psychology department. I‚Äôm a current psychology major here! 

So far, I have only taken two courses within the Psychology department, but I have really enjoyed them. What really made it a great experience for me were the professors. Obviously, I am biased, but I think the psychology faculty is one of the best here at Williams. All of the professors I had were not only great at teaching, but they were very approachable and kind. They really want to get to know you. The lower division courses in psych are lectures (but even then it‚Äôs capped at 50-140 which from what I heard is way smaller than bigger research universities), yet the professors do smaller journal clubs and discussion sections for ample participation. 

I‚Äôm also potentially planning to go to graduate school for I/O or a professional graduate degree, and one of the reasons I picked Williams is due to the small size. Getting to know your professor is much easier here (the school pays for you if you ask your professor out to lunch), and letter of recommendations for graduate school programs, I think will be much more specialized and unique. There‚Äôs countless resources here for you, and professors will be happy to help. 

TA position-wise I think is quite easy. Most professors have only 1-2 positions, but I think the key is emailing early and expressing interest. Don‚Äôt be shy to check-in again about it. I was able to become a TA by emailing the professor and just expressing interest. Research is a bit harder, but this is just my experience. Most professors have a waiting list, but I have been told if you really want a research position, you should be able to get one. It just might not be as a freshman. If you are okay with staying over in the summer, most professors are happy to host students as summer researchers. 

Due to the professor I wanted to work with having a longer waitlist, I cold emailed a Williams alum who is now a professor at a big research university, and I‚Äôm currently conducting business psychology research for the business school there! The alumni really want to help out.

3. It says online that in your sophomore year, you must take 3 of each 'subject,' like Math and Science. Can I get a jumpstart on that as a freshman and get these requirements out of the way, or do I just have to take them sophomore year?

Thanks in advance!",lcgjepz,"Hi. Welcome to Williams. You seem to have misunderstood a few things. This is what the catalog actually says (copied from catalog):

‚ÄúCourses are grouped into three divisions:

Division I: Languages and the Arts

Division II: Social Studies

Division III: Science and Mathematics

Students must complete at least three graded (see COVID-19 policy addendum) semester courses in each division. Two in each division must be completed by the end of sophomore year.‚Äù

So you can take those three classes per division any time as long as you complete at least two per division by the end of your fourth semester.

P.E. Classes do not count towards your courses. They are a separate ungraded requirement.

Now for the opinion part: in my opinion, a tutorial is wonderful but definitely intense and you probably want to take only one per semester.

Best of luck and enjoy the experience!",5.0,Wordwoman50,lcgj0e7,"1. Definitely only do one tutorial for your first semester ‚Äî they are very intensive, and if you end up enjoying them after your first semester, you can always take multiple another semester.

No one from my school has ever been accepted into Williams :(

Also, I'm a domestic applicant (US citizenship) in another country.",lb0do9b,"Hey! I‚Äôll be a freshman at Williams this fall looking to major in Anthro/Humanities. I was the first applicant and accepted student from my school, too! Williams was definitely off the map for me, even though I‚Äôm from MA (closer to Boston). When I got in, I was actually honestly chill about it, but when I did research and visited, I became super excited‚Äî so I‚Äôm glad you have seen the sparkle of Williams so early! 

Personally, my ECs weren‚Äôt anything extraordinary‚Äî President of a major club, VP of another, Co-Pres of a minor club, and a part time job for five years. I finished second in my class of 550 with 11 APs. I‚Äôm not a STEM kid, I didn‚Äôt have any cool awards, but I did what I could. 

With that all being said, I truly think one of my biggest strengths as an applicant was the writing supplement. If you aren‚Äôt familiar, Williams has you submit a 3-5 page paper on any subject you want. It‚Äôs unique because it‚Äôs not a traditional college writing supplement (like the ‚ÄúWhy *This College*?‚Äù ‚Äî Williams doesn‚Äôt do those)! I recycled an argumentative paper about Hostile Architecture I wrote in AP Lang my junior year. I was passionate on the subject, it was well written, and I was happy with it. And now I‚Äôm on the road to Williamstown in August! 

My biggest piece of advice is to not let the fact that no one from your school has ever done it before hold you back.

I don‚Äôt know of any alumni from my region either‚ÄîI emailed the admissions office about it and even they were struggling to find anyone (still waiting to see if they have actually found someone). Somewhat interestingly, my school sends people to T20s each year (usually 1-3 people get accepted for ivies), which made me surprised to learn that no one had had a successful application before me.

With that said, focus on things that matter to you! For me, I had two-three standout ECs (a niche sport that isn‚Äôt recruited anywhere, language stuff, and debate). Academically, I was top of my high school in science and Spanish, as well as debate extracurricularly (I was a waitlist admit, so I feel somewhat confident in saying that these updates were impactful; I had actual awards in all three on the school and local level). I had high coursework rigor, good test scores, and a near-perfect unweighted GPA as well.

Make sure you submit the supplemental paper if they do it again during your application cycle‚Äîwith no actual supplements, every part of your application counts.

I'm not sure that history counts as a social science, and it is a research paper with sources (although it's not like you really need any background knowledge to get it), so I don't know if that's really what they're looking for. 

I do have an English paper that I could submit instead, but it's not quite as good. Please let me know if any of you guys did WOW and can give some insight!",l8k1g93,"Williams prefrosh here! At Williams, there are three academic divisions‚Äîlanguage and the arts (Division I), social studies (Division II), and science and mathematics (Division III). History, of course, falls under Division II, social studies, so it would be rather hypocritical of Williams to say that history doesn‚Äôt count as a social science. In short, subject-wise you‚Äôll be perfectly fine! They‚Äôd only really have an issue if someone went way out of bounds and submitted a paper written for a science class or similar.

The goal of the academic paper is to get a sense of your writing and thinking style in an academic setting, if that makes any sense. They don‚Äôt want to see a lab report or research synopsis, they want to see you as a thinker in a liberal arts setting. The paper I submitted for college apps was my take on the hypocrisy of the American political climate, which I wrote for an English class. The only thing I‚Äôd caution about with your history paper is whether it is mostly analysis and commentary (good, in this case) or large chunks of evidence, quoted or paraphrased (much less good, in terms of what Williams probably wants to see). If the bulk of it is your own analysis and thoughts, go ahead and use it! If it‚Äôs largely excerpts or big chunks of evidence, maybe weigh it against your English paper‚Äîwhich one shows your way of thinking best? Which one paints you as a writer (and subsequently, shows your personality) most accurately?

No matter which one you choose, best of luck with your WOW application! Also, one last thought: make sure that whatever paper you submit meets the minimum length suggested by Williams. Don‚Äôt worry as much if it goes over the max by a page or two‚Äîit‚Äôs better to give them too much material than not enough.

1cxot07,Everyone Getting off Waitlist,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/1cxot07/everyone_getting_off_waitlist/,15,2024-05-22 01:46:25+00:00,None,Anyone realizing that it seems like a billion people are getting off the waitlist this year? Just surprising considering that in the past few years 0-1 people have gotten off the waitlist. Is this just because of how weird this year has been so far in terms of the college season?,l54p4hv,"So there‚Äôs definitely a bit of an abnormality this year with waitlist admits! There were 3 people admitted off the waitlist for 2023-2024, 0 for 2022-2023, and 1 for 2021-2022. However, in 2020-2021, 73 people were admitted off the waitlist, and in years prior 20-25 waitlist admits seems to hold true enough. The uncertainty of financial aid with the FAFSA and the overturning of affirmative action means that there will likely be a lot more waitlist movement this year than previous years for top private colleges and universities, most likely due to a greater number of cross admits (applicants who are admitted to multiple top colleges with traditionally high yields) as well as admitted students to these top colleges committing to state flagships if financial aid isn‚Äôt coming through.

However, another contributing factor to Williams‚Äô waitlist movement could be the sheer number of applications they received this year, which was 4,000 more than last year. It is possible that Williams was a bit more conservative in the number they‚Äôd admit than usual, or (and based upon an article from the Williams Record, I‚Äôm inclined more towards this) that the number of cross admits and financially uncertain students was large enough that they had a noted deficiency in class size (let‚Äôs say 20-50 spots) and are now admitting from the waitlist, which some people have surely been declining either due to insufficient financial aid or having decided to commit elsewhere (cross admits would affect the waitlist as well). What could be a bid to fill 40 spots could lead to 120 waitlist admits if there isn‚Äôt high interest or means from who they are admitting‚Äîthe choice to do away with a supplement this cycle could be a big impact on their ability to gage interest as well.

This year, my liberal guesstimate would be that 150 people or less were brought in off of the waitlist. My conservative guesstimate would be closer to 75, as seen in 2020-2021. Regardless, it‚Äôs good for us (I‚Äôm a fellow waitlist admit) and negligible to Williams‚Äô acceptance rate given the massive increase in applications, so who‚Äôs complaining?

I‚Äôve been waiting for this question. You can DM me but I‚Äôll leave some general info here

1; Major at an overview, more info on website:

Theater here is a liberal arts program, meaning you do NOT hyperfixate on one aspect of theater, such as acting, with daily studio work. Instead, the program is interdisciplinary. Every major has to complete 4 courses covering theory, design, and dramaturgy. Then you can have 5 electives (200s and 300s level) and be a bit more focused with those. The major also requires 4 credits with department productions, one of which must be in stage management and three of which can be in whatever aspect as long as the involvement is sustained throughout (performing, designing, directing, etc.)

EDIT: They often hire visiting artists and professors to teach more practical classes, like acting. Next year seems very abundant in studio acting classes.

2; What kind of department productions are put on?

The department has 2 shows per year, one per semester. Faculty members vote on what is produced, and it is different year to year.

This past year, we did Dance Nation in the fall, a contemporary feminist play, and Natasha, Pierre, and The Great Comet of 1812 for the spring, a musical.

Next fall, we are indeed doing Shakespeare, specifically Much To Do Bout Nothing. Spring TBD.

3; Outside of department productions, which are led by faculty and professional artists, there are many opportunities to perform with student run groups: Cap and Bells, the student-run theater group, the film club, stand up clubs, slam poetry, choir, student dance groups, acapella groups, and student honors theses in Theater (maybe even more). Diverse productions; diverse interests; diverse experience‚Äîhighly subject to what an individual wants.

4; Williamstown Theater Festival

It still exists, still pretty available every summer. HOWEVER, it has gone significantly downhill following a scandal in 2019. Their attempts to reestablish themselves have been abysmal.

Other than WTF, we have Barrington Stage Company and Shakespeare & Co which are pretty big regionally.

5; Final recommendations

The department is overall strong. There are many alum working successfully in the field. This semester (spring 24), 2 alums visited Williams to present their works in progress and talk with students.

Best to pursue if:

1. You want to be a multifaceted, well-rounded theatermaker.
2. Plan to get conservatory training, like an MFA, later.
3. Simultaneously want to do or learn something else other than theater.
4. Is open to job opportunities beyond the theater
5. Want to pursue theater academically postgrad, such as a PhD in Performance Studies, Theater Studies, Theater History, etc.

I highly recommend Williams for theater. In today‚Äôs world, an artist has to be a critic and thinker who is knowledgeable. This place is a wonderful incubator for such an artist.",9.0,hth1hth1,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôm an Amherst alum who chose Amherst over Williams. To me, the most important distinguishing features are Amherst‚Äôs open curriculum and access to five college courses.

It is hard to overemphasize the value of intellectual freedom the open curriculum affords.  This plays out both in the opportunity to explore your own intellectual interests and the academic environment created when you and all your classmates are in a class because of genuine intellectual interest.

Not every student may choose to take five college courses, but my sense is that many do.  I was a philosophy major and took two graduate logic courses at UMASS.  My wife also went to Amherst and she took dance classes at Smith and Mt. Holyoke.  Our daughter is currently a Smith student and she has taken courses at Amherst. UMASS, and Hampshire.

A secondary benefit of the consortium is access to lectures and other events.  Our daughter has gone to lectures at Amherst and UMASS.

I was admitted into Williams for the upcoming fall semester and now that I'm actively considering it (and leaning towards attending), I'm kind of stressing myself out over a slip in grades I had last semester. To cut to the chase, I went from straight As every other semester of school to this last year with 3 As, 3 Bs, and 1 C; my final GPA for that semester was a 4.3. My schedule was as tough as I could get it and I struggled a bit with that; my As were in AP Psych + Calc BC and dual enrollment civics, my Bs in AP Macro/Micro/Bio, and my C in AP Phys C E&M. I don't think those are unreasonably bad grades for those classes and especially given my circumstances (I do these classes virtually through my school because we don't offer them in person) but I am worried about the possibility of my acceptance being revoked because of the grade slip. I know it wasn't that big of a drop---from everything I've read, it sounds like I'll be alright because it wasn't in the grand scheme of things *that* drastic, but I'm still concerned. I never got a mid-year grades report submitted so that wasn't considered when I was admitted (my counselor sent them that today through Common App, and I've emailed admissions regarding the situation, still waiting to hear back from them on that). This semester's grades will be better, likely straight A's with maybe a B/C in physics.

Should I be worried? We're planning on visiting Williams this weekend and I don't want to make the 10 hour drive there only for it not to be an option. I know nobody here can likely answer this concretely but any perspectives on it would be nice while I wait for my answer to come in the email.

And, does anyone have any recommendations for things to do/see on campus or in Williamstown during a visit? :) Not entirely sure what else I can do other than walk the campus and try to get a feel for it all. Like I said, I live 10 hours away from Williams (in West Virginia) and so I want to make my trip count, both so as to have made it worthwhile and to soothe my anxiety about attending school somewhere so far from home.

I will be going to the 12th grade in 6-7 months and I will apply early with the PG (Predicted Grade) which will be given depending on the results in the IB mock exams. I plan to apply to 8-10 universities. At the top of this list is Williams College. There are some reasons why I chose this place as my main target.

1- My sister is a graduate of Williams College Class of 2022 and I want to follow in her footsteps because I have identified her as a role model for myself.

2- They are very generous regarding Financial-Aid. This is a big plus since it is very difficult for a middle class family living in Turkey to pay 70-80 thousand dollars to a university every year.

3- I had the opportunity to visit the campus last summer. Both the campus and Williamstown were truly a wonderful environment. I think it will be worth spending 4 years of my university life.

4- Students are offered different opportunities that I have not seen in Turkish universities.

4. Severe social issues/problems. Some people get into drama (sometimes their fault, sometimes not) and because this school is small, it can materially impact how you socialize and/or where you can hang out for recharging.

There are more important things in life.

As much as I bitch about the work and isolation and yadi yada, I love Williams.

30 percent of students will die on a hill for Willy, and so will I. 50-60 percent is like meh, like Williams okay but not super passionate. 10-20% truly suffer and hate it, which makes me roll my eyes a bit cuz they often overlook key advantages of the college and complain about things that they should have known when they made their decisions. Don't wanna discredit people who have bad experiences as Willy can do tons of work to be better, but some people are delusional to think they'd be better off at another institution comparable in prestige and quality---the issues described by another commenter here exist ubiquitously and to far greater degrees at peer colleges from what I've seen.

You'll love Williams if you are appreciative of nature (I don't even hike, never did Mountain Day lol, but you absolutely must appreciate the air, the stars, the moon, the snow, etc.); you don't mind being in the antithesis of a city (I do mind this a fair bit ngl, but willing to trade off); love academics, and I do mean love, because it is intense af, more so than many Ivies (have many friends all over, we discussed workload copiously before); don't mind a small student body (this has a host of pros and cons).

You‚Äôll have to make some extra effort to be more enmeshed in the Oxford community. 

Academically, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything like it-in mostly the best of ways. Unless it has changed a lot‚Äîthe Willy prof supervisors actually went out of their way to arrange for the tutorials that a student wanted‚Äîand this could be as small as 1:1, and it could be as varied as studio art in a Q to English the next. The hard part is that it is hard! It counts to your gpa, sometimes 2x, so while your friends are skydiving/pass/failing elsewhere in the world you might be schlepping to 2-4 different libraries/reading a few hundred pages/writing a 5-7 page paper in a week (all nighters were not an unusual occurrence)‚Äîso if you want a relaxing academic junior year, WEPO isn‚Äôt it.

Non-academically Oxford/England is an awesome base to travel from sometimes during period, but mostly during the long breaks b/w periods. Unless the budget canned it, there‚Äôs a week long group vacay b/w 2nd and third terms. The other thing is that it is not impossible but somewhat more complicated to get stateside junior internships while abroad.

Unless it has changed, financial aid should travel with you ‚Äîand fin aid folks have first dibs on minor jobs at the Willy dorms for extra spending money.",7.0,AdmirableProduce7767,,,,

Many of my intro STEM classes frequently have less than 30 people, no chance you would ever get that kind of classroom experience at a large ivy.

As for academic rigor, Williams is a pretty work-intensive school since our semesters are only 12 weeks long. In general, course content is almost identical regardless of what institution you attend, but undergraduate teaching at an LAC like Williams is a top priority, so you may end up having a much better time at learning. Still, this school is pretty hard depending on what you major in. If you are thinking of pursuing law, be ready to read a lot. Between philosophy, political science, and other social science courses, expect to read (or more realistically, skim) a few hundred pages before class seminars.

Opportunities at this school are amazing. Whether it's getting an internship or conducting research, you almost have to try to not end up with very good experience by the time you graduate. The alumni network provides amazing connections regardless of what you want to do, and for placements into professional/graduate programs, Williams is easily up there since you are just given so much individual attention that you wouldn't otherwise get at a larger university.",29.0,ykxz,kwiqi3v,many people I know at Williams including myself chose Williams over an ivy,7.0,None,kwh2bxj,I have heard doctors say ‚Äúthe smartest kids in med school came from Williams!‚Äù,6.0,Smart-Dottie

I am a rising in senior in HS looking to apply to Williams ED in a few days. I am a gay guy and would like to have at least some options when it comes to community/dating/hookups at college. I know that just because of how small the school is there will definitely be limited options, but I was hoping there would be at least somewhat of a pool (even if it's shallow.) Also, I was curious given the athletic culture how the queer community is generally treated. My questions are:

1. Is there a decent sized population of mlm and other queer guys?
2. How common are gay couples/emphasis on hookups or relationships? 
3. general treatment of gay men specifically?

Thanks for all these answers btw this thread is so helpful when it comes to looking at colleges I appreciate y'all.

&#x200B;

(I copied and edited a similar post from a year ago that did not have comprehensive answers)",k85vpdp,"Hahaha, oh it‚Äôs so difficult to talk about this. I am gay, gender-fluid, femme-presenting and have had a decent amount of experience.

There is a decent number of mlm and gay guys, some class more so than others. About 15-25 in general.

There‚Äôs no discrimination here in my experience. But there‚Äôs a ‚Äúnatural segregation‚Äù wherein queer people hang out more amongst ourselves and with fellow ultra progressive folks, but more so for relatability. I have many straight cis male and female friends, too.

As for, hookups, and so on‚Ä¶ ahh, I have failed miserably, but maybe it won‚Äôt be that way for you. I went on dates with 3, 4 guys but we never hit it off. We just didn‚Äôt have the right chemistry. I know of one gay male couple.

I‚Äôm on Grindr periodically, but I‚Äôm one of 3 people with face pics in among 10 student users. I met 2 close friends through Grindr, hooked up with one who was a closeted athlete (graduated), had a short term fwb situation with one senior (graduated), and ghosted by the rest in any attempt for anything. About Grindr specifically, the area has mostly old closeted married guys who are wayyy too predatory, but for some that‚Äôs fun (?). There are some nice college students around in Bennington, Albany area, and further south in the Berkshires. If hooking up is your thing, it‚Äôs still very achievable with outsiders (well, from experience‚Ä¶) with effort.

I have 3 gay male friends. Most gay or queer guy will have a couple of similar friends, but there‚Äôs not like a stonewall type of solidarity amongst the gays here. 

Oh also, I connected with an alum on Homecoming  who is super nice. We had great sex and amazing connections.

What else‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs all I can think of for now. Make of it what you will, but take it with plenty grains of salt: it‚Äôs a singular experience in a school of two thousand.

The chances of me getting in are extremely slim but I still want to try and submit a competitive application. That being said I ended high school with all A's, was #7 in my class, had a ton of community service hours, was actively involved in clubs, and even had an internship for two years. I am focusing on maintaining high grades this semester and joined a club that corresponds to the career I want to pursue and will help me gain volunteer hours and experience. In order to stand out as a transfer applicant for Williams what do I need to do?",k7roqsy,"I don‚Äôt want to be Negative Nancy, but chances are even lower than 3.06%. Most transfer applicants are from community college or more traditionally underprivileged education background. The stat also includes veterans, I think. This means transferring from another 4-year accredited college is very difficult.

That said, here is my advice. Williams of course cares about academic excellence and ECAs, but that is the expected standard and not enough. In crafting your application, focus on these questions:

1. What makes you unsatisfied with your current environment? What do you learn from it?(Don‚Äôt be bashing it too much though, more like ‚Äúit wasn‚Äôt a fit‚Äù)

2. Why do you think Williams fulfills what was lacking at your old institution? 

3. What is your idea of the Williams community (kinda overlap with the previous question)? How can you contribute to this community?

4. Why are you an academic fit with the school?

In answering these questions, find an angle about you (personality, career, one activity, etc.) that underly every answer. This helps you appear clearer to the readers and makes your application consistent and a stand out.

I‚Äôd also suggest be really specific about your answers, do your own research first, then perhaps ask more specific questions. I‚Äôll also be honest that any answers in the vein of ‚Äúbecause Williams is a good school,‚Äù ‚ÄúWilliams grads make money,‚Äù or prestige, etc. will result in a sure rejection.

It's a program that nominally exists to label certain courses in biology, chemistry, physics, and comp sci under one umbrella term. If you check this link [https://bigp.williams.edu/courses/](https://bigp.williams.edu/courses/) you will see a lot of courses are registered under those disciplines, and in the course description it will say BIGP. It also shows a lot of courses that are offered right now, or have been offered recently (unsure where you got the 2019 part). Usually elective courses cycle every two years, so during your four years at williams you will have two chances to take a certain course within the BIGP track. 

If you want to pursue bioinformatics or biotech as a williams student, you would have to choose a major that exists at williams, try to take a lot of courses that fall under BIGP, and pursue research or internships through professors who do research in biotech/info. I don't personally know anyone who is doing that, but I'm sure there are more people in bio or comp sci who have done this or are working in biotech/info right now. 

Pros of not really having a BIGP major is that you can try out different disciplines of science and choose which side of BIGP fits best for you, develop a good basis of fundamental skills that will come in handy when you pursue graduate education or a career in BIGP. Cons would be that you're not going to take a whole lot of BIGP-centered courses. Which I don't think is a big con because 1) as an undergrad there's a 99% chance that you'll change your mind about your dream career and 2) in order to pursue BIGP you have to learn bio/chem/physics/compsci anyways, so why not dedicate your undergrad years learning that and then go on to specialize in BIGP.",2.0,cecilejiwoo,,,,,,,,

If you are adamant on a club / bar scene, Williams will not be it for you. But, my overall memories were solid parties in a ‚Äúsafe‚Äù space.

Good luck w your choices ahead!",8.0,cvielma1,jv8hjnw,"Can't explain in detail what you will get out of Williams, since I'm not a partier myself. There are parties every weekend somewhere on campus, some in smaller basement spaces and some in larger ballrooms / actual party or dance spaces. There's one street with a couple of co-op houses that throws a lot of parties, and also a couple of apartments on spring street throw parties. Many student groups also host formals frequently. During midterm or finals week I've seen some people complain about the lack of parties, but it usually ends up coming back alive the next week. Weekday parties usually don't happen unless it's Thursday in October or you plan a party with a group of friends who all happen to be free that night. 

In terms of your question, I think it's a matter of priorities. If you already like Williams for other things and would also like to find a party scene, you will be able to find your people and be satisfied here, although maybe a bit disappointed at times. But if having a good party scene is high on your priority, and/or you think Williams is kinda not bad but also not super amazing, you might genuinely be dissatisfied. 

I would also think more about how attached you are to city life, rather than just thinking about it in terms of just the party scene. It's not like there's an extreme shortage of partiers, it's just that even the most hardcore partiers have to make do with the many constraints of being in a small rural college town with 2000 students. Which is sad.

Looking at course guide. Would appreciate some recommendations for good courses to start out with. Great professors, smaller classes, not too demanding, not too quanty for first semester to get into the swing of things. Thanks so much!",jtxlozq,"Take courses that interest you and that have professors who are well-reviewed by students on WSO. A good professor makes a big difference.

Be sure to take some small, discussion-oriented classes, as they are what makes Williams great!

Fulfill distribution and other requirements with courses that interest you. Know the requirements and start planning how to meet them. You will want to try to meet several of your requirements early in your college career. Get them out of the way, but do so with courses you will truly enjoy that will enhance your learning experience. You should be planning now how to meet all your requirements by graduation. If you meet most of the requirements in your first two years, you will have more freedom later.

Also give thought to prerequisites for other courses you may wish to take later; take those prerequisite courses.

There is no need to take only 100 level courses as a first year student. If a class needs some type of course experience first, it will have a stated prerequisite.

Aim for balance in your course load. For example, if you are someone who mostly enjoys subjects that will have a lot of reading and a lot of writing assignments, be sure to take one class per semester that is less heavy on reading and writing (i.e., maybe has problem sets and a midterm and final instead of multiple writing assignments), so that your workload is manageable. It is always good to ensure a balance.

Be sure to sample a variety of subjects. Don‚Äôt narrow yourself too much. You may discover new interests! I myself entered Williams thinking I‚Äôd major in Biology, and by the time the middle of sophomore year rolled around and it was time to choose a major, I chose English!  Interests and talents develop during your college years.

Before you graduate, take at least one tutorial. They are amazing and the quintessential unique Williams experience. You may want to wait until a later semester for this, since tutorials are intense, but keep it in mind for the future. (A few tutorials are especially designed for first year students, though, so read the descriptions.)

When reading the WSO reviews of courses and professors, listen carefully to what students say, and consider what matters to YOU. For example, if you find a course topic fascinating and its professor is described as an excellent teacher who has rich insights into the topic, is great at leading discussions, and is good at helping students to become strong writers‚Ä¶ but some students on WSO complain the professor is a hard grader‚Ä¶ you may decide that, to you, the potential for an outstanding learning experience far outweighs the risk of one slightly lower grade that semester. (On a similar note, don‚Äôt shy away from taking some risks. College is about learning new things. That said, aim for balance, so that you don‚Äôt have an overwhelming workload in any given semester.) (EDIT: I noticed you mentioned wanting to ease into college with an easier first semester. That is not a bad idea, particularly if you went to a high school that was not very strong academically and might need some time to adjust. And all first years need to leave themselves some mental and emotional room for time to adjust to being away from home, to make friends, to explore clubs or activities, etc.)


Strategize while picking courses. Have some other courses in mind as a backup plan for if you don‚Äôt get into a particular class with limited enrollment.

Above all, take classes you will enjoy. Have fun learning!

Someone sent me a private message on a similar topic, and, in drafting my reply, I navigated back to the Williams subreddit to check if there was a related discussion there, too‚Ä¶ and when I navigated back to my messages, their message and my unsaved draft were no longer there.

1.  Take it easy, don‚Äôt be greedy.

In high school we try to do everything possible for college applications. That is no longer true. It is okay to ‚Äúmiss out‚Äù and focus on either what you love most or deem most helpful.

2. Reach out for help

Whether academically or socially, so many people are here for you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to ask for help.

3. Better be safe than sorry, take it easy

Err on the side of caution. Give your homework a bit more time. Do a little less. Take courses slightly easier than your absolute max capacity. After the fall, adjust accordingly. I approached college in the crash and burn style, which was not the best.

4. Have faith that things will be alright

There‚Äôs not much to elaborate here. Things will be fine. Have faith in yourself. You‚Äôre more capable than you think. And if things aren‚Äôt fine, there are those struggling, too. You can survive anything.

Finally, I'd appreciate any advice/guidance if anyone at Williams is looking towards biotech! How is Williams in this regard? Thank you for your time :)",ji9itxe,"Idk what prejudice you have about rural communities, but there are plenty of dentists and therapists available. The school has psychologists and prescribers at the health center and there are several local hospitals. 

The region has lots of hills, farms, neighborhoods, cities, and anything else ‚Äî but often requires a drive. 

Trust your gut! If you want to go somewhere else that‚Äôs OK but Williamstown is what you make of it - maybe all places are? So best of luck whatever your decision is!",14.0,ArrgguablyAmbivalent,ji9ibiq,"I can answer some of these. Williams has a health center on campus for basic check ups, there is an urgent care less than a ten minute drive from campus, and CSS will transport you to a hospital or outside appointment if you need it. Williams does have therapists on campus (I don‚Äôt remember how many, 7-8?) they normally do like 45 minute appointments every other week but I know you can ask for more if you need it.

Tons of river access! People go to the river all the time, there is one on the East side of campus and one on the North side. They are smaller but not streams either, one is big enough for swimming and the other is nice to walk into and play in when it‚Äôs warm. There are lakes nearby you can drive/hike to.",7.0,emotionalthief,ji9kvgz,"It depends what you like. Coming from a suburb close to NYC, I infinitely preferred the rural mountain beauty of the Williams area.The Outing Club is quite active and can get you to nearby water activities, with canoeing or kayaking, if you like water. Straight from campus, you can walk to the trails along the Hoosic River (near the northern athletic fields) or the Green River (off Water Street), both of which are close enough for a mid-day ramble between classes.  It is a very short drive to the Cascade Trail with waterfalls. And to lots and lots of mountain hikes with lovely views (taken full advantage of on Mountain Day, when the bells ring and classes are cancelled so everyone can go hiking.)

In terms of activities, on any college campus, there will be a lot of cultural and social events happening on the campus itself. More than I‚Äôd encounter without much more effort in my suburb! There are also three world-class art museums nearby. But yes, it is a rural area, so you will either absolutely love that or it might not be right for you. If you felt isolated, it may not be right for you, especially when you are a first year student. (Student cars are not allowed until sophomore year, though there are local buses and the college helps with transportation for health needs or for student clubs and groups that want to travel somewhere.)

The health care system at Williams College itself is adequate but not fantastic, IMO. To address your dental question, you easily will be able to find dentists in the surrounding area, and the college will provide transportation if you need it. Yes, you can get in-person counseling/ therapy; here‚Äôs a link to the website page about mental wellness: https://health.williams.edu/mental-health-assessment-and-treatment/. But Williams may not be the best college for mental health support.

Its professors and intellectual environment are amazing. Williams is a very special place.

As a general rule, you will have 

1. some required courses for your major (which you can sometimes talk your way out of if they don't make sense for you) or grad school entrance requirements
2. Courses you choose based on the professor. Almost always choosing courses based on professor makes sense; you can always learn stuff but learning from and with great people is amazing.
3. Courses you choose because the content is super interesting. Much lower priority than #2 but this happens.
4. I'll probably get downvoted for thisbut should mention courses you choose in part because of the time of day. This is unusual, but studies show you perform better if you don't try to take classes with different sleep schedules than you use. I only did this one semester, and it seems absurd, but it worked surprisingly well.

Learn to do course shopping in the first days of the semester.

Only some courses you want to take will have tutorials. By all means though, take the tutorials when you are interested. If you got in you're bright enough to do it, it's just a 2-on-1 with a professor once a week and assigned reading etc...; my guess is half the students not doing it either means they don't see ones they are interested in (small departments may only have a few and large departments may have a lot of students), they don't get into them, or maybe they don't want to be in 1-on-2 course meetings with professors (it will be very obvious if you didn't do the work).",3.0,tcpWalker,ji5ffor,"i chose williams for the tutorial program. i have taken four tutorials and i hope to take another one or two next semester. i adore them and they have been the most worthwhile courses for my education here. i wish there was a domestic oxford program where your entire williams edu was just tutorials. 

i don‚Äôt think the other courses did nearly as much for me - i need to be held accountable and i can‚Äôt for courses that the prof won‚Äôt notice that you haven‚Äôt done the reading or where you can get away with not talking during the class. 

i had a friend take three tutorials in one semester during the three-class covid rule. a lot of students do not take a tutorial during their time at williams. they‚Äôre considered difficult and a lot of students worry about their gpa, course-load, or they do not like to read and write very much.

It feels like I get smarter after every class, and I love the skills, depth, discipline, and rapport the class type uniquely fosters. That said, some students don‚Äôt take them because they‚Äôre too time-consuming, don‚Äôt work with their schedules, or are just not interesting to them. 

As someone who took more than 1 tutorial a semester, I will tell you that it‚Äôs overwhelming. 1/semester sounds much better. Also some tutorials you will be fine to get into, some are over enrolled by a 2:1 ratio. You will have to contact the instructor to have a shot at the class.",2.0,hth1hth1

1. do you think the career center is extremely effective at helping students prepare for interviews, write their medical school applications, etc.? like i've heard a lot about the support they give you but is it actually genuinely groundbreaking and extremely helpful?
2. in your opinion, do you think williams grade inflates, deflates, or neither? what are some common classes that are generally seen as ridiculously wayy too difficult? essentially, i kind of want to know how difficult it is to maintain straight As and A+s -- like what is the time commitment, basically? how many hours do you generally spend on homework? obviously this differs across major, level of class selection, and classes themselves (so would also be awesome if you could specify these in your answer!)
3. what does the social scene look like? how often do people party, are these parties enjoyable, etc. is it easy to make friends and are people generally down to like go out or like study sesh together etc.? what do people usually do for fun?
4. i've heard that williams' culture can be overly like white and preppy -- do you think this is true?
5. how competitive is the premed culture? do you think premed stuff gets at all cutthroat?
6. overall, why do you think premeds drop out? how many generally do? do more people drop out because they realize premed is too much work and it's not worth it, or because they realize they want to do something else, or because of really difficult classes or discouragement, or because they failed a premed requirement that they're not good at (like physics or smth)?
7. i've heard it's insanely easy to get research at williams -- very much as simple as talking to a prof after class -- but is there also good support for undergraduate students who want to conduct more high level research on their own with the help of a professor? like have students written their own papers and done their own research, the kind that gets published and wins awards yada yada
8. how well do people do with medical school applications? like how many people per year generally get into super top tier medical programs? do you know anyone who applied to and succeeded with applications to md-phd programs? (the dream fr)
9. how easy has it been for you to form meaningful relationships with professors and like actually talk to them one-on-one about academics, random stuff that doesn't really pertain to class, personal stuff, etc.?
10. are there competitive club applications?
11. random and maybe not so random cons of williams in your opinion? like what tiny things irk you? what big things irk you? especially what is the biggest annoyance of living in the middle of nowhere LOLL
12. pros of williams that you didn't realize would be amazing until you attended?
13. how do you think williams has most supported you as a student and as someone preparing for medical school applications?",jhma2i4,"Not in Medicine but am a Williams grad :) 

1. Very helpful for finance and pre-med otherwise it‚Äôs so so 
2. Neither - avg gpa was 4.4ish maybe 4.5 a few years ago and the school keeps a normal dist - every student regardless of major spend at least 45-60 hrs a week staying if not more - bring this up to 80hrs a week for majors like compsci - if you want a 4.0 as a premed you‚Äôre either going to have to be a genius to put in some serious hours - but pls remember sleep is very important!!!
3. Parties start at 11:30pm and promptly end at midnight - pregaming starts at 10-10:30pm - you‚Äôll most likely be finishing up a pset right before - parties only available Fridays and Sat
4. Very preppy very white but  definitely can find yourself a good community if you‚Äôre neither white or rich (I certainly wasn‚Äôt)
7. Yes it‚Äôs hard but it‚Äôs much easier when you don‚Äôt have to compete with grad students who get priority when it comes to research opportunities and funding

How is on-campus recruiting? My other concern is prestige bc Williams is not as well known as NU and that may be a con when it comes to the job search, especially in a field like finance.

&#x200B;

Edit: NU as in Northwestern",jg24g1b,"Go to Williams if you loved it there, unless you love NW more. Very few people care what school you went to after your first or second job. But if you're someplace you love to be you'll do better.

For Internship/job placement, learn to network. Build your linkedin connections, learn to work a room, reach out to alumni in your field, etc...

If the market is decent when it's time for an internship you can reach out to alums who work for the places you would like to intern and see if they have internship programs. 

Maybe on-campus programs will help and and maybe campus job boards will help and they're always worth checking on but I would not count on them working for you at any school--it's a very hard job to do well.

Neither are necessarily targets for cs but you can easily break in from either if you put effort in. I will say however that in my experience the placement for williams in finance per capita is stronger than at NU, with many ib and consulting firms actually increasing their recruitment from williams.

I got into Vandy, Duke, and Williams College. I still don't know where I want to go or what I want in a college other than the fact that all three are great schools. Financials isn't a problem because I got generous aid from all three plus outside scholarships. I am going to major in STEM (specifically biology) and want to go to dental school eventually so what school should I choose!? I heard Vandy has severe grade deflation in STEM while Duke does grade inflation. Williams on the other hand has great figures when it comes to their students getting into med school (90%) but I can't find any data for dental school. Still, I am still not too sure where I should choose üò≠üò≠üò≠",jfo1cm5,"pick between williams and duke based off what vibe you like more, since vandy is not really comparable",7.0,shiftyblock,jfo94wk,[deleted],6.0,None,jfqs7b4,"Congratulations on having three amazing choices!

Any of the three schools will put you in a good position to get into dental school. So I encourage you to put ‚Äúlife after college‚Äù on the back burner for now and get ready for an amazing four year experience of learning for the joy of learning. You only get to go to college once. Live in the moment for those four years! (Well, yes, do summer internships related to your intended field and take any required courses for dental school. But don‚Äôt forget to study and enjoy topics totally unrelated to dental school!)

Your first choice is Williams versus the other two: small college versus research university.  I think that choice comes down to depth of discussion vs. more variety of specialized topics.

A major decision to make is how much you value classroom discussion. A small liberal arts college will provide much more of that. Williams is really a very special place, where you will learn to read, write, discuss, and think about topics with great sophistication. The opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions of the learning with your professors and fellow students in a small group setting, or even in a tutorial class with only one other student and the professor, is amazing at Williams.

On the other hand, if you have a highly specific research interest that is somewhat uncommon, you may be more likely to find a professor who shares it at one of the larger schools. There will be more choices in the course catalog and more research interests represented in the faculty. Williams will support you in an independent study, for sure, but Duke or Vanderbilt may have an expert in your area of specialization.

Also a thought- Williams profs will pick undergraduates for their research assistants because there are no grad students (except for two tiny programs in art history and development economics).

Being extremely familiar with both Williams and Duke campuses and communities (sorry, I am not familiar with Vanderbilt‚Äôs), I can say they are both amazing!  Williams has gorgeous natural surroundings and a wonderful rural small town environment.  Durham is a large town that offers cool diversity and a plethora of dining and shopping options (if you have a car‚Äî it is very spread out). Duke has prettier buildings than Williams and a better, more dramatically beautiful campus layout. Williams has prettier nature views. In addition to Durham‚Äôs great restaurant scene, the food at the Brodhead Center (Duke‚Äôs largest dining location) is vastly superior to food at Williams. Williams has a great ‚Äúfreshman entry‚Äù dorm system which will help you get to know other freshmen and give you a sort of cozy family grouping right away‚Äî and unlike at Duke, freshmen don‚Äôt have to live on a separate campus and take a bus to the other campus! Duke will have more extracurricular options, but it may be easier to get involved in the ones of your choice and get leadership roles in them at Williams. Plenty of trade-offs for each college, but no wrong choices!

Personally, I prefer the unique small liberal arts college setting for undergrad and then a world-class research university setting for graduate school. But that‚Äôs me. You have to find what works for you. Don‚Äôt be afraid to go by ‚Äúgut.‚Äù Which of the three schools do you feel most excited about? Which feels most like it could be ‚Äúhome‚Äù for you? Try this test: compare the colleges two at a time, and imagine saying no to one and yes to the other. Which one do you feel saddest to say goodbye to?  That‚Äôs the one you should go to, unless finances or closeness to home or another factor is even more compelling.

You really can‚Äôt go wrong here. All three choices will surround you with smart students and professors. There‚Äôs not a clearly ‚Äúwrong‚Äù or ‚Äúright‚Äù choice. Weigh any personally important factors, like ease of travel/ proximity to home, and otherwise, pick the place that ‚Äúfeels‚Äù best to you.

As for ‚Äúhow it is‚Äù at Williams, I can tell you you‚Äôll get dedicated attention from professors who are there to teach and are very willing to help you if you‚Äôre struggling. This isn‚Äôt usually the case at larger universities where you‚Äôll have a 500 person lecture for BIO101 and will likely be taught by a TA. You‚Äôll have a more intimate relationship with your professors across the board at Williams than you will at a large university. 

(I know they say this in the brochure, but it‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs not unusual for students and professors to go out for coffee together or just chat casually. Some will even invite you to your house)

Beyond that, you‚Äôre more likely to get research opportunities as an undergrad at Williams bc the research opps aren‚Äôt taken up by grad students. I had many friends who did their research/published with professors as undergrads. More than that, there are specific funds for you to do summer work and even travel and do work in say Iceland on Uncle Eph‚Äôs dime. 

At the end of the day though, it‚Äôs up to you to decide which learning environment is best for you. But if placement and program strength are your questions, you won‚Äôt have to worry one bit at Williams.",1.0,DooDiddly96
1255x78,Questions from an Uninformed West-Coast RD Admit,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/1255x78/questions_from_an_uninformed_westcoast_rd_admit/,18,2023-03-28 23:18:22+00:00,None,"Hi there! I was accepted to Williams College in the RD round 2 weeks ago. I haven't committed yet, as I still have a couple of questions that I was hoping I could get answered. To preface, I'm a political science (and possibly economics double major) major interested in the law and or consulting.

Thank you for all of your help!

&#x200B;

1. Is it true that there's grade deflation at Williams? Even with local or east coast graduate schools or employers knowing that grade deflation is common, would it negatively affect my placement at jobs or schools in other regions (such as the west coast, etc)? Are Williams' opportunities limited to the Boston/ Northeast area?
2. Are there student gyms available to work out? I could find a few student organizations that allow you to borrow equipment, but are there any local or college gyms that I could go to regularly?
3. What are the chances of receiving a single room vs a double, given that I select my preference as ""single"" on the housing form? I've seen a couple of posts about selecting Mission vs. Frosh Quad. Is there one that's better than the other, or one that you would personally recommend (for making friends, etc)?
4. How easy is it to double major OR change majors? I read that 40% of all undergraduate students double major at Williams, but how much flexibility do students *really* have? I got accepted for Political Science but I'm considering adding Economics and pursuing consulting after college.
5. One of the biggest drawbacks for me is that Williams doesn't accept any AP scores or College Credits. I've taken (and will be taking) a total of \~15 AP tests with passing scores, and also another 10 college classes that would satisfy 75% of community college requirements in California. I could skip 1 to 1.5 years of CC requirements, but weighing that against a 4-year Williams education is rough... Has anyone else been in a similar situation before?
6. The feeling and sense of a community are super important to me. How active are the Debating Team or the South Asian Students' Association? I come from an Asian-dominated county, city, and school. I'm open to all demographics and realize that Williams contains an entirely different cultural dynamic. How active are associations like SASA, and how big does their membership tend to be? Are they smaller close-knit groups, or are they wider groups with their own friend groups and cliques?
7. One of the biggest pros about Williams is its huge alumni network and successes in job/ graduate school placements. Can anyone describe their experiences with the '68 Center for Career Exploration? What does the process look like? Does it involve emailing former students at Williams? Is this the same as the EphLink mentoring website? Also, since a large percentage of Williams alumni take jobs in Boston, are there alumni that help connect you with opportunities in the west coast or southeastern United States? (similar to #1)",je2xmyc,"Hello! It's been 25+ years since I was lucky enough to be accepted to Williams. I hope you have as good an experience there as I did. I mention this because some of my comments may be (very) out of date. 

1. When I was there, Williams was known for having one of the toughest As to earn of any college. Because I never really applied for a super elite grad school afterward, it never mattered to me one way or the other. But if you are applying to a super elite post-grad program, well, they'll all know Williams and it shouldn't hurt you. In fact, it will likely help.
2. There is a student gym on campus. No need to go off campus to work out. 
3.  I can't tell you the specific odds for single vs. double (as things have changed in in the intervening years), but I can tell you that I had single all 4 years and had plenty of friends.  
4. I double majored and it was fine (poli sci and biology). The hard part is that you have less of a chance to explore the rest of the departments. Changing is harder the farther in you are, as there are just fewer classes left to fulfill requirements. TBH, I'm confused as to how you were ""accepted for political science."" At least when I was there, you weren't even allowed to declare a major until the end of sophomore year.
5. Has the College changed its AP policies? In the old days, you could use them for placement, and if you had 4 with good grades, you could place out of semester. Except for financial reasons, I can't see why one would want to do that. Williams was great and I had no reason to leave early. Of course, I only had 4 APs, so I guess that's different than your situation. I'm assuming that with your resume, you also got into other comparable institutions - do others have better policies?
6. Can't speak to campus culture now. 
7. I've lived in Chicago and Boston since graduating and while the networks outside of the Northeast are small, they are diehard. 

On another note, you seem exceptionally driven (even by Williams standards) - your discussion of consulting and T14 law schools (on another thread) - are way more intense than anything I was thinking about as I was about to graduate high school. But then again, so are the 10 college and 15 AP courses you claim to have taken. If it's possible, I would try to visit to get a vibe from the campus. I think it's super important as you get a sense of where you're going to be learning for the next 4 years. One thing I loved about the Williams of 25 years ago was how people were super intellectual, while also being sporty, musical and artistic. People worked hard, but they also took the time to build community, follow their pursuits and just get to revel in spending time with a bunch of other really smart people. 

Hope this helps.",7.0,sithteacher,je310g4,"1/ not really, classes are just really hard. A C average from Williams won‚Äôt affect most placement unless you are looking at hyper competitive positions/programs. Your transcript will show how you challenge yourself etc etc so don‚Äôt sweat this yet. 

2/ yes, the facilities are world class. Gyms, weight rooms, pool, racquetball, cardio, Rockwall- nearly anything is available. 

3/ not sure lately, but mission has more singles than frosh quad. 

4/ very easy! I mean other than all the class work. But manageable. Also you don‚Äôt declare until soon/junior year so you have time to build out your core credits and prerequisites while exploring different subjects. 

5/ in various subjects you can place into more advanced courses, but you won‚Äôt be able to apply your AP credits to your transcript/degree. It won‚Äôt matter though, you will be able to skip what you already know and free up time to learn new things too. 

6/ Lively debate at WC has been a tradition. The SASA is thriving (or was when I was there). There are core member events and lots of open events sponsored by SASA, they are a very open and welcoming crew. 

7/ experiences vary, it is up to you to leverage the network. They won‚Äôt come find you. But there are tons of mentorships and job ops through the network and it is a very valuable resource!",5.0,ArrgguablyAmbivalent,je2wyce,[deleted],2.0,None

I (an international student) just got accepted to Williams ED1. I'm super happy to be joining you all next year! 

I got a generous financial aid package, but my family will still struggle to make ends meet, so I'm looking for ways to help them and gain some extra money during my college experience. Could anyone tell me if there are work opportunities for freshmen at Williams, especially international students (given the weekly 20-hour cap)? Any additional would be highly appreciated.

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance!",izo8uzz,"Congratulations! And yes, work opportunities for freshmen is limited because students don't usually become TA until sophomore. Some options that I know are library front desk works in sawyer/schow; Dining hall opportunities (though I'm not sure if they are actively finding new people); accompaniments in music if you play instruments; tutoring kids in local schools etc... CLiA (Center for Learning in Action) have some paid position too. 

You can always contact Fin aid if your family situation change drastically too. 

A side note about 20-hour cap, the cap was raised from 10 hours just starting this year.",3.0,shen2333,izuazwt,[deleted],2.0,None,j00utyy,"Definitely go for the desk jobs, although they are popular. I started as a desk assistant at the special collections, which is a small part of the library with cool old books and very kind, very cool librarians. This job is less popular than other library desk jobs simply because not a lot of people know that it exists. If you're a desk worker you just get to study while on the desk so it's great. 

I got lucky and was able to move onto a research assistant job at the special collections, which pays better, when they learned I was a multilingual intl student at a time when they were looking for people to identify and catalog stuff from my home country. Mine is a special case but I feel like the special collections desk job does offer ways for people to find better employment later on, as I know that some people who started as desk assistants moved on to work full time over the summer etc. And your language ability (if you speak anything besides English fluently) will come in handy under many unexpected circumstances. 

Also I suspect there will be one or two of mundane office jobs open at the beginning of the year because upperclass people who start out with those jobs usually move on to better paying fun jobs like TAing. Like printing, scanning books, distributing posters or advertisements around campus etc. From personal experience the job itself is pretty shitty but in the end you get to meet cool new faculty and staff members who will occasionally offer you a cookie so that is nice. 

Another job I like is backstage crew for dance/theatre shows. You only work for one week, but you have to work for at least 3 hours each day, sometimes up to 5+ hours. Theatre shows may require you to take care of props, help with costume change, clean the stage, etc. Dance shows may make you sweep the stage, help with lighting, set props or instruments on the stage etc. Theatre shows were more time consuming, as they have longer tech weeks. Get your name on the list of people interested in backstage crew. An advertisement poster will be posted somewhere in the 62 center for theatre and dance during the first semester. This is a position that will always be open, since they always need people for any type of show they do. 

Handshake is a platform that williams uses for on-campus jobs and you will be guided through it during orientation. browse through that occasionally. actual employment won't happen until after the beginning of class, whereas advertisements will probably be posted late august - early september. I don't know if shooting people an email looking for jobs will work, but you could also try doing that if you know for sure you want to work for a certain department/office. Definitely ask other people (especially your international orientation leaders) about what kind of jobs they have/had first if you want to go for the email method, because i feel like there are lots of positions that you can reasonably shoot for, but only a handful of them are actually advertised. Who knows, maybe some department thought they didn't need help with scanning books but would actually benefit from your help... 

As an intl they tell you during orientation that off-campus jobs are a no and will get your visa cancelled. Idk if there are people who do it sneakily, but I personally don't know a single intl person who has an off campus job and it's most probable that nobody can actually do that lol. 

Meanwhile enjoy your acceptance letter, and get some much needed rest. Congrats!",2.0,cecilejiwoo

- Do the courses you take during Winter Study go towards graduation requirements?

You can choose to take a relaxed class that is fun to explore, an intensive class that helps you learn something new/practical,make up for a course that you dropped in the previous semester, or even do some research through special programs designed for that period.

For most people, it‚Äôs a time to take one relaxed class. Which usually means classes three times a week on something interesting like Lego and maths, wine tasting, psychology of psychopaths, or whatever you may want.

Since the course load was so much lighter than normal, there was more time to ski, play intramural basketball, play on the club volleyball team, and just hang out with my friends. So much of the experience of being at a place like Williams was the chance to just get to know and spend gobs of time with smart and interesting people from around the world.

The second best thing is the alumni.

Yes, job opportunities are more limited during the fall and spring semesters because of the location, but you‚Äôll be busy with your classes then anyway.

And for life after graduating, Williams graduates are recruited by the most prestigious companies, receive fellowships, and are accepted to the very best graduate schools in their chosen fields.

(TL;DR: Edexcel student here, have always been above average as a student and got all 9s in IGCSEs, but flunked my AS-level exams and ended up getting BCC, although, I believe that my true strengths bloom freely with my ECAs. Should I apply ED to Williams, my dream college, or just go for a safer option?)

I am from a LDC in South Asia, and I have received an Edexcel education ever since middle school. All throughout high school, I have been a decent student, ranking in the top single-digit percentage always. The hard work paid off as I got all 9s on my IGCSEs (otherwise, I got a 4.0 GPA in all of my courses for my sophomore year). However, owing to following an improper mode of hybrid education towards to end of 2021 and the first quarter of this year, my AS-level education was severely hit and I ended up getting BCC on my 3 subjects. In retrospect, it isn't the end of the world, as I am retaking a few papers and hoping to bounce back, but the sadness (and I only say this because I haven't been mentally evaluated to be clinically depressed) I suffered through this year has harshly impacted by mental health and wellbeing - which in turn affected my SAT score too.

I retook the SAT on Oct 1, and am expecting a 1450+ hopefully. However, my strengths get fully expressed through my ECAs. I am a Duke of Edinburgh Alum, having completed all the journeys and having received all three certifications. I was also in charge of handling the marketing for 2 F&B giants in my country, and during my tenure, we reached 10s of millions of people across the internet. Being an adept growth hacker, I co-founded (and am serving as the chief editor) a news platform which quickly became the biggest bite-sized media agency in my country, and which reached people in the metric of 100s of millions across Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, and even LinkedIn. The success of our bite-sized media agency saw one of our competitors partnering up with us to come under an umbrella company - one that I am a majority stakeholder of, and that has recently been valued at $1.0 million in our seed round (however, we are aiming for a $1.5 million valuation currently). Besides, I have been part of my school's football club and MUN club since middle school, having won trophies and medals for my football team, and serving as the director general at my school's MUN conference. Moreover, I have also appeared on a soap opera on our national TV network, and have acted in multiple OVCs, apart from voicing several commercials and characters over the year. I have also served as an English tutor to a few juniors, over the years.

Williams College has almost been like an exotic dream for me ever since I was in the 8th grade, and learned that my cousins graduated from Bates, Wellesley, and Pomona, while one was soon going to start at W&L.

Reasons it might be a top choice for you might include its top professors and students with small discussion-oriented classes (including the incredible tutorials with only two students and a prof), its gorgeous mountain setting, its freshman entry system that helps you get to know other students quickly upon your arrival, its amazing career and grad school outcomes, its wonderful intellectual atmosphere in which to explore ideas and become a strong writer and thinker, and its strong financial aid program.

Don‚Äôt apply if you are uncertain if you like its size and its rural location, or if being in a place with great food and immaculately kept dorms is important to you. Williams puts its money instead into the educational quality, extracurricular supports and special opportunities for students, and financial aid.

If you want to compare aid packages and might be happy to get merit aid somewhere else, then applying early closes that door, so don‚Äôt do it. BUT, Williams is the most generous school in the nation right now with its new no-loans all-grant meets-full-need need-based aid program with need-blind admissions for domestic students. So use the net price calculator on their website to see if the estimated family contribution makes the price tag seem manageable to your family. If it does not, don‚Äôt apply early. If it does, go for it!

Honestly, I don‚Äôt know how the optional SAT thing is changing admissions at top colleges. Now, with a glut of students with 4.0s applying and fewer SAT scores to distinguish them, it seems much harder to be admitted absent another ‚Äúpull.‚Äù Perhaps early decision may be the boost that could help distinguish you.

If you do apply early decision to Williams, I recommend applying somewhere else that you like that is easier to get into that has nonbinding early action at the same time. Then, if you are rejected or deferred from Williams, it won‚Äôt be as devastating because you will know are ‚Äúin‚Äù somewhere else and will be going to college!

-great balance of qualitative/quantitative course work
-excellent faculty! The anthro/Soc profs are still very dear to me. 

Cons:
-limited seats (and unfilled roles) in faculty: this may not still be the case, but years ago the dept faced cuts and hiring freezes/challenges that left it understaffed. 
-fewer profs means more competition for a seat in various specialty courses (majors get prio, so if you intend to major Anth you should be OK)

Hi! I‚Äôm a lesbian first year at Williams. Coming from an urban area, the queer scene at Williams was a big adjustment. Objectively there are hundreds of queer students, but it doesn‚Äôt always feel like it. Mainstream parties feel tailored to a pretty hetero hookup culture. There is a QSU that holds events, but they rarely throw parties so it doesn‚Äôt really feel like there‚Äôs a centralized queer community. The queer community has a lot of overlap and feels pretty insular (people know each other/ have mutual friends most of the time).

Do students have the time to spend time pursuing non-academic hobbies? Current students: how would you say your time is split between academic and social pursuits? A party scene isn't a huge priority for me, but being able to socialize & blow of steam is important nonetheless. In a similar vein, is there a diversity of co-curriculars? I'm pretty outdoorsy, but there's only so much hiking I can do before I lose it.

I've really liked Williams since the very beginning (one of my very top choices for a variety of reasons, and also my parents love Williams). I want to fully do my research though before I commit anywhere, so I'd appreciate if people here could answer some of my questions! Thanks so much, I'm so so happy üòä

1. What's the 'tutorial based' academics like? What does this mean exactly? How has your experience been with this teaching style? 

2. What's the friendship scene like? Stratified groups? Everyone socializes with each other, and a few really close friends? Parties? (I'm not a big party person but like to try things out and meet people and have fun) Also- I really don't plan on joining a frat/sorority in college. 

I'm pretty extroverted, but mostly in the sense that I like to spend quality time with my friends or really get to know people. 

I'm not a super outdoorsy person either, which does kind of worry me for my fit to Williams. I like walks and stuff but hiking consistently would be too much for me. 

3. Are you liking the social life at Williams? I heard Williamstown is a hit or miss with people. I talked to a girl from UMich who hated Williams's campus/town and loved UMich's campus/city lol. I'm leaning towards liking a small school more, but I'm not completely sure that I want to be super far away from a city. I like going to cafes and restaurants and museums and stuff. 

4. I'm really confused as to whether I want to pursue medicine (psychiatry) or law. Is Williams a good place to explore both and decide on one path in people's personal experiences? And then how are people doing with law/medicine internships, law/med school admissions, research, etc.? 

5. Does Williams have grade inflation or deflation? 

Lastly for now 6. What's the mental health of the student body like? 
I'm currently a dual enrolled high school senior at a local university with a ~60% acceptance rate. Freshmen here have disappointedly told me that this uni was their 'safety school,' even if I didn't ask at all and the uni is very good! (like... okay I don't know why I had to know that or what I can sayüò≠). Anyways, the overall mental health/student satisfaction here is pretty bad (5+ suicides this year of underclassmen) and the school spirit is medium-low I think. I don't think I could deal with this kind of environment somewhere else for 4 years. How does this environment compare with Williams's?",i1g3zw8,[deleted],9.0,None,i1hdxpq,"1. Tutorials are just a different format of learning environment. Two students with a professor. Onr person writes a longer paper on that week's topic, the other writes a paper in response, and the class time is spent discussing the points. In my opinion, we really don't have that many at Williams, so people who love them can try to load up on them but many students go by without taking one. I took one elective tutorial class and did feel it sharpened my writing skills, since you have to churn out papers quickly for every class. 

2. We don't have frats and sororities, though some of the sports and other extracurricular groups pretty much mimic that kind of social group. There's a pretty wide range of social activities for such a small campus. You are probably going to find places to fit into. 

3. Williamstown is very rural for sure. That said, the college and town does try hard to mimic some urban conveniences. I personally lived in cities/big suburbs all my life, so having those 4 years of rural life was a big plus for me. Restaurants might be the part you miss the most. Dining services try, but they are not restaurants, and the area has few decent options for eating out but not many. 

4. I can't think of a better place to try out both if you are undecided. A ton of people double-majored, partly because our major requirements are not very heavy. They have pre-professional programs for both medicine and law. You do have to put in the work and be proactive, but lots of opportunities for internships and experienced in either field are available. 

5. This is my personal opinion based on having gone to many different types of colleges in this country, but Williams and most colleges/universities in this country  suffer from grade inflation. I'm absolutely not saying it's a cakewalk through every single class, but if you put in the work, study, and do your assignments, you will get at least the grade you deserve. Most times, you will be saved from a failing grade if you're willing to show effort, even if the product of your work is not good. The caliber of the education, the quality of instruction and content, is definitely high compared to the average college in this country, but it doesn't mean you will suddenly fail every single class because you're not from a fancy prep school. It was not easy going from coasting at my shitty public high school to being so confused in entry-level classes because it was clear most of my peers were exposed to actual college-level education prior to coming here. But my professors and TAs really worked with me and gave me so many opportunities even when my results deserved a failing grade. I've attended institutions where the instruction quality was so poor but if you don't make the certain number grade on a poorly-written test one time, you were given no room to improve yourself. 

6. It's really variable. I do think that for POC, it is a much harder issue to deal with on campus because the school has a hard time securing and keeping mental health professionals and resources that can help students of color, specifically. That said, there are resources and help available on campus. It's also good to acknowledge that while some people have only great time at Williams, some don't find it so great here. I had classmates who transferred out because they weren't happy here, and I still keep in touch with some of them. I wasn't a super Williams-pride student, yet here I am spending time to answer your questions because I'm excited for you. Some people are really all about school spirit, even long after graduating.",4.0,purofound_leadah,,,,

How‚Äôs the dining hall food, and do you have access to a high quality grocery store as a student (e.g., some organic food options)?",hzzudo3,"I graduated Class of '21. The food at Williams is overall, very good. Granted, there are a few weak spots. For one, I know it can be difficult to get food variety if you have a very serious food allergy (someone I know has a very serious  gluten allergy and has had trouble getting food that isn't contaminated). The food quality also decreased during the Covid year(s), which for me was my senior year, but from what I've heard from my friends still on campus, since the restrictions have been reduced over this past year, the food has gone back to what it used to be. 

A formidable percent of people on campus are vegetarian/vegan, and almost everyone usually tries to eat meatless at least one day a week. There are truly lots of good healthy options for students, I never  found myself thinking ""damn I just want a damn fresh vegetable."" If you wanna just eat pasta and chicken strips you can, there definitely is the standard dining hall food as  well, but that's always supplemented with a salad bars, and several other courses that are a blend of vegetables and meats. They  also use locally-sourced veggies from local New England farms whenever they can. 

As for grocery stores, you need a car or bike typically to access them, but if you don't usually you can borrow someone's car, there are plenty on campus and most Ephs are good about sharing vehicles. There is a stop-n-shop for most groceries, and they have an organic food section (not just a shelf, like a whole part of the store is for organic  groceries.) There is a Wal-Mart further down route 2 about 15 min. away which has less organic food but is massive and has almost anything you would need since it has food, but also clothes, medicine, shampoo, craft supplies, candles, etc. Finally, there is a store near campus called Wild Oats that is an organic food store. It's obviously pricier, but it's all organic, locally-grown foods, and although I never frequented there, my friends who did go there really liked the selection. 

This is a lot of info, but this is all to say that there are lots of healthy fresh food at Williams. So long as you aren't unreasonably picky or have a severe food allergy that requires your own custom-made meals, **for a college campus** the food is definitely high quality and fresh.",9.0,here4theoffice,hy41nzy,"Honestly pretty good. I really enjoyed the cafeteria food while I was there. All the dining halls have salad bars too.

The Stop&Shop down the road has decent health food options, or there‚Äôs Wild Oats which is an organic coop but way overpriced by my standards.",9.0,Stone2443,i1azo24,"I have heard from upperclassmen that the food has gotten much worse during Covid (dining has had some pretty major staffing problems). This seems to be reflected in comments left by alumni vs current students. The options are generally pretty limited if you have dietary restrictions (although Williams will set you up with a dietician and design a meal plan for you if you need that). I would say healthy options are generally available, but there isn‚Äôt much variety (some kind of bean thing, a dryish lean meat, potatoes/ a mix of cooked starchy vegetables, and really crappy lettuce).

I also come from a great food city and the food here is definitely a bummer, but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs inedible. It‚Äôs not a thing you‚Äôre going to love about Williams but it‚Äôs totally not a deal breaker. If anything, it‚Äôll make you appreciate good food even more :).",2.0,Creepy_Kitchen4792

I‚Äôm a Berkshire local and a Williams student and I‚Äôd say it very much depends on your definitions of ‚Äúactive‚Äù and ‚Äúlocal‚Äù lol people sometimes go to North Adams for Mass MoCA or to eat but it‚Äôs not NYC.

2. I'm not sure, but I know there are a lot of on-campus communities for minorities (there's an entire community resource called the Davis Center, which is a space for POC. There's free snacks, a free kitchen to cook in with friends, other resources, etc.)

3. Activities kinda depend. There's lots of restaurants, a movie theater, etc on Spring Street (across the street from the college), the nice Williamstown Library, and more.

I was wondering what you guys thought of my likeness to get into Williams. I'm a Hispanic immigrant (yay america lol), I'm currently the salutatorian of my graduating class, my sat wasn't so great at a 1440, but hey I tried. I also have the rigorous course work with AP classes etc, but I assume most applicants have that too.  I have a good amount of extracurriculars, and I actually have invested time on them.  

Williams is very appealing to me as the environment sounds great from what I have read, and the fact that the offer their partnership with Columbia to possibly get an engineering degree with the Williams sounds pretty useful later on. So yeah, should I expect to be disappointed or is there any hopes? Also how important do you guys consider the essay to be in the application?

Thanks :)",,,,,,,,,,,,

This is absolutely not true in my experience. If you have a disability they will recommend medical withdrawal before giving you actual solutions to your problems or accommodation. It seems like literally no one is happy here. I know several people who are considering transferring because of how toxic the work culture here is and how damaging it is to the mental wellbeing of the students. Somehow this school costs over 70k a year yet the counseling center and office of accessibility are understaffed.

Additionally, the administration has treats us like actual children. Yes, it is great that with COVID they ensured we did not have an outbreak. However, they put unnecessary measures in place that literally no one supports. For example, there was rumors that someone got roofied a few weeks ago and the school decided that we could only swipe in to our own dorms. And this was at all times. Just a major inconvenience that did 0 to help the situation. And now campus security is shutting down parties in dorms when they never did before, killing the already non existent nightlife here.

And this is not even to consider the additional stress if you are not rich, white, cis, and able bodied.

I see a lot of people struggling around me‚Äîwith being behind on work, with mental health problems, and all that.

But I wouldn't say that it's *every* experience and that nobody is happy.",16.0,Like-A-Phoenix,hk2oq0m,"I appreciate your perspective, and I'd like to offer a slightly different way to look at things. 

I took 5 years at Williams and had to leave school for mental health reasons for one year. As you said, they encouraged me to drop out but then they also encouraged me to come back when I was ready. They supported me throughout that journey. Were there some staff and faculty at Wiliams who were unhelpful? absolutely. Were there some that saved my life? Also yes. 

However, Williams is, first and foremost, an institution of higher learning. Its aim is to train the leaders of tomorrow in their various fields. It's not a mental health facility. It's not a hospital. They have on campus counseling, their teachers and staff will help you, but outside a few people at the health center they are not professional therapists and psychologists for the most part. As callous as it sounds, it's really not their job and should not be our expectation of them to help us when our own mental health has deteriorated to that point. They can do the best they can, and I've seen them try to help in many ways, but at a certain point the best option simply is to step away from school and go get some professional help. When that point arrives, there's not much the school can do except recommend a medical leave of absence. 

If you're struggling like this I would recommend continuing to weigh your options carefully. Don't consider the work, or the academic goals, or anything else. Just think about what you need, and whether or not Williams can provide it. For me, I got to a point where there was nothing left they could do, so I had to leave. I hope you can find a way without that, but if not just know that that's fine! you can take your time.

If I continue this semester on my current path, I should have around a 3.8 GPA. My question is what is the overall vibe and culture at Williams in terms of the student body? How‚Äôs the campus? Would I have a good shot at getting in based on my GPA and current situation as a transfer student? Thanks!",hgzfltu,"Of 356 transfer applicants last year, Williams admitted only 9, as per the Common Data Set ([https://www.williams.edu/institutional-research/files/2021/09/2020-2021\_CDS\_Williams\_College\_tuit-2.pdf](https://www.williams.edu/institutional-research/files/2021/09/2020-2021_CDS_Williams_College_tuit-2.pdf)).

But your grades are good, so there is no harm in giving it a try, even though the odds are slim. Perhaps also try for many other similar small schools.

The campus has some great aspects, with gorgeous mountain views, a beautiful library, an attractive library quad, a walkable campus also with walking distance of hiking trails‚Ä¶ and two less nice aspects:  Route 2 bisecting the campus (not too terrible- it is a two lane road that is much less busy than the double yellow lined two lane road in my suburb at home) and dorms that are in various stages of aging/upkeep.

Students vary, as is true anywhere, I suppose. Lots of nerdy types, lots of athletes (and somewhat different cultures between those two groups)‚Ä¶ people who like to party, people who like to play board games or video games, people who like to hike or bike or canoe, people who like to sit and around and talk with friends, lots of attendance at concerts and plays and speeches and campus sporting events. The students are nicely diverse, from a wide variety of backgrounds. You can expect to have friends from different racial, cultural, national, state, sexual preference, and socioeconomic backgrounds from yourself. 

As a transfer student, you won‚Äôt have the unifying experiences of the freshman entry experience, so I would recommend getting involved quickly in an organized club or group or a club sport, in order to make friends. That‚Äôs the best way to meet people, although you also can ask someone you‚Äôve been talking to in a class to join you afterwards for lunch. You will meet people and find friends, *though it will take effort and initiative to do so.*  In general, though, people are friendly and nice.

But the reason to go to Williams is the academics. IMO, that‚Äôs where you will love Williams. If you crave intellectually stimulating conversations with brilliant, caring professors and bright, interested peers, Williams is THE place to go. It is hard to imagine that a college education could be better anywhere else. For deep thinkers, Williams is nirvana.",12.0,Wordwoman50,,,,,,,,

Thank you if you are reading, and I would appreciate a response!",hfieu59,"1. Yes. For an international student on financial aid, unless you have a hook (some sort of ultra-stand-out  thing), you should assume the only way you'll be accepted is if you apply ED. 
2. Yes
3. There are many singles, some doubles, some shitty dorms, and some nice ones. You will probably only get a shitty dorm as a sophomore - freshman and upperclassmen typically have quite livable housing situations.
4. No, but most of the year is cold enough that it's not really a problem.
5. Competitive enough, but your SAT is a little low. Unless you have something that really stands out, it is difficult to get accepted, regardless of test scores.
6. HUGE yes on this one. Beautiful campus. It gets even nicer in the fall, and the winter has its own beauty as well.
7. Yes.
8. The food options are good enough. Sometimes it sucks, but generally it's good.
9. You will be safe. Most people on campus are too worried about offending anyone to be racist. You may experience unintentional microaggressions, but it should be a rare occurrence. There is also a tight-knit international community here so you should have no problems making friends. (Confession: in my opinion, international students are the friendliest and smartest people at Williams)",7.0,KenVatican,hg14zaj,"Just to add to the other comments:

ED is great, if the estimated family contribution on the net price calculator works for your family and you would be happy to attend Williams if you get in. Nearly half the class is admitted ED. Financial aid for internationals is not as sure a thing as it would be at the similar Amherst, which is one of only a very few US colleges to be need blind and meet full need for internationals.

Dorms:  Yes, there is a common area kitchen in many dorms. No air conditioning in the dorms (although I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôd do if you have a documented health issue‚Äî they very well might accommodate you with a unit‚Äî you could ask.) It says on their website that wired Ethernet is turned on only if you request it, but there is a procedure for requesting it. There is WiFi everywhere. There are not problems with using a laptop for schoolwork, but Facetime calls work more smoothly in some locations than others.

60% of freshmen live in singles. Your friend group‚Äôs lottery number determines whether or not you will be able to get a single sophomore year‚Äî or if you are friends with a housing coordinator, they can pull you up with them. During junior and senior year, everyone can get a single, and seniors can also enter the co-op lottery.

The weak spot for Williams, amid all its many wonderful strengths, is its attention to quality of life aspects. The dorms are often not so well maintained. Plus the dining is much less good than it is at, for example, Bowdoin or Middlebury. And this year, dining is a disaster: they cut back hours, leading to long lines, made it impossible to reenter the serving area at one venue, and temporarily suffered from a shortage of forks (which was brilliantly spoofed in their student humor publication, The Haystack).

The surroundings are beautiful, and the college takes advantage of its location with walls of glass in the library through which to view the mountains, as well as traditions like Mountain Day, a random Friday in October when it is suddenly announced that classes are cancelled and everyone hikes up the local mountains (organized hikes range from easy to difficult, on different trails, and nonambulatory people can take a bus to the top of a smaller mountain/ hill).

Not all parts of the libraries are open 24 hours, but there is a 24 hour study room in the main library.

It is hard to imagine a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù setting than the remote, rural, college-centered Williamstown.

And, as another poster noted, it is very cool to be an ‚Äòally‚Äô and very uncool to express overt prejudice.

The most amazing and satisfying aspect of Williams, though, is its academics. Brilliant professors and peers you will interact with through many small discussion-oriented classes, including the incomparable two-person tutorials.",3.0,Wordwoman50,,,,

pgshak,Williams vs Swarthmore,12,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/pgshak/williams_vs_swarthmore/,5,2021-09-02 22:43:52+00:00,lyd_ahmadi14,"Hey folks! New here. I'm a high school senior from NY planning on applying ED to either Williams or Swarthmore. Looking to major in history and pursue a PhD and/or JD in the future, but I'm flexible (of course haha).

Was hoping people could shed some light on the differences between the two that I *can't* find on the website. I know all about Swat's honors program and Williams's tutorial program--love both! I like the Williams campus and school spirit more than Swat's, but I feel a more politically left and grad school prep vibe at Swat.

Differences in diversity? Does Williams have a preppy jock vibe? Which is best for someone ambitious but also politically conscious (I am a well-researched and published Marxist). Thanks guys <3",hbe8c01,"Both colleges are outstanding. You can‚Äôt go wrong here. In fact, there are more similarities than differences between them- all the benefits of a small college, with small classes, close relationships with professors, and deep, rich classroom discussions. In addition, the student bodies at both colleges are intellectually vibrant and enjoy ‚Äúthe life of the mind.‚Äù

In response to your questions, I believe that both colleges are similar from a political standpoint. Both lean liberal, and the students who are the most vocal activists are on the left end of the political spectrum.

There are two commonly made comparisons on these forums that just seem not to match reality. 

One view has Swarthmore as crazily intense and Williams as more relaxed. Honestly, I think that Williams now has all the same intensity that is traditionally attributed to Swarthmore. Plan on studying a lot at either college.

The view of Williams as preppy or jock-heavy also rings false. First, athletes don‚Äôt dominant at all. Yes, there are a lot of athletes, and yes, there are some ways in which certain athletic team cultures can be a bit isolated from the rest of the students. For example, if you are a male fall helmet sport player, you probably will spend more time with your teammates, while the rest of your freshman entry (dorm group) is spending more time together as an entry. However, if you are a nonathlete, except for cheering on your entrymates at some events, you probably won‚Äôt be thinking much about athletics, because you will be busy with other things that interest you, whether those are music groups, theatre groups, a variety of activity or special interest clubs, hiking and the outdoors club, etc., etc. There is so much to do at Williams, and there is a fascinating variety of interests!  The students there tend to be passionate about their intellectual and extracurricular interests, but to have a wide variety of interests!

Second, ‚Äòpreppy‚Äô definitely feels wrong. The students come from a wide variety of backgrounds. And the way the freshman entry is set up, friendships are formed between people from very different backgrounds, socioeconomically and otherwise. In terms of clothing and culture, I would say that most kids wear things like jeans and sweatshirts or T-shirts, and, if I were to unfairly stereotype the wide variety of students, I would probably say ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù is much more predominant than ‚Äúpreppy‚Äù!

So, how to choose between the schools?

Swarthmore is suburban and a short train trip from Philadelphia for a quick weekend visit. Williams is rural and remote, surrounded by breathtakingly beautiful mountains. Swarthmore has a more uniform stone look, while Williams is more of a hodge-podge of architectural styles. You may be drawn more to one physical environment than the other.

Each has its own hallmarks. I know Williams better, so I will speak to its unique attributes:

1. The tutorials are indeed awesome: just two students and one professor, where each week one student writes a paper based on the readings, taking a stance, and the other student responds to it with a critique.
2. The freshman entry system involves about 40 freshmen living together alongside 3-4 unpaid junior advisors, who have no disciplinary functions but act more like big brothers or sisters. There also is the Ephventures orientation program (where you choose your own adventure, which might involve exploring local attractions like art museums or going on a backpacking trip in the mountains). Between the two, you will begin your Williams experience with a built-in group of people alongside you as you adjust to college‚Äî people with whom you will go to dinner, hang out, etc. It‚Äôs a nice way to start your college experience.
3. Winter Study - Whether you‚Äôll love it or hate it, you‚Äôll be at Williams in January, taking one pass-fail course, with a variety of fun topics, travel options, independent study options, etc.
4. The Mountains- Where else would the school song be about mountains and a favorite college tradition be Mountain Day? Mountain Day is a random Friday in October when classes are cancelled that morning so that students can go on organized hikes up the local mountains.
5. Opportunities- The resources are incredible. Financial aid covers not just the basics, but every book you need for class, skiing or snowboarding equipment and costs if you take one of these for PE class, even a suit for your interviews if you need one. And even if you are not an aided student, you will benefit from the college‚Äôs resources by receiving money for your student club to go on trips to tournaments or events, and from alumni-sponsored internships, and various other benefits. And the alumni network is actively involved and very supportive. 
6. Also, you said you like history. The history department at Williams is absolutely amazing! Great courses, wonderful professors.
7. You also said you might pursue a JD. The Law Society at Williams offers both a Moot Court and a Mock Trial Team, and these provide fun socialization as well as some like-minded peers. And the tutorial system will prepare you well for making and defending an argument and critiquing someone else‚Äôs argument!

Two amazing colleges. Try to visit or talk to some current students at each. It may come down to whether you prefer proximity to a city or to the mountains. Or you may just go by your gut feeling, where you feel more ‚Äôat home.‚Äô Probably, in truth, most people who would be happy at one of these colleges would be happy at the other.

p90047,ED Dilemma: Williams College vs. Dartmouth College,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/p90047/ed_dilemma_williams_college_vs_dartmouth_college/,2,2021-08-21 21:47:28+00:00,LethalVenom1,"Hello!

&#x200B;

I'm a rising high school senior that is applying to colleges this fall. I've narrowed down my ED schools to Williams and Dartmouth and I'm having a bit of trouble deciding between the two schools. I would appreciate any insight that students had that would help me decide. For reference, I will most likely want to study Economics and do something with math, whether that be either doing a double major or getting a minor in math. I will also be cross-posting this to both r/WilliamsCollege and r/dartmouth to get as much input as possible from current students or alumni.

&#x200B;

In terms of the quality of education, I have heard good things about both schools, especially in regards to their econ departments as they are very popular at both colleges. I think the math department at Williams is quite a bit stronger than Dartmouth's, though. Moreover, both schools say they're ""undergraduate-focused"" but I think this is more true of Williams where classes are smaller than Dartmouth and fewer students are competing for research positions and stuff like that especially in a major as popular as econ. Some Wiliams students I have talked to said they even chose Williams over HYPSM because of this and said that Williams has the best quality of education in the world. Does Dartmouth compare? Also, Williams has the Oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.

&#x200B;

The Alumni network also matters to me a lot since I am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. I've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. However, Dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from Dartmouth than Williams. While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in. I don't really know which is better, but I would say maybe Dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but I would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each school.

&#x200B;

This is kinda unique to Dartmouth but I don't know whether the D-Plan is on net good or bad. I've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. Sophomore summer and ""Camp Dartmouth"" sound cool too. I've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. I've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.

&#x200B;

In terms of the campuses, I, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either Williams or Dartmouth. Architecture and the ""look"" of a school matter to me a lot though. I really like the rural vibes of both the schools. If anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.

&#x200B;

In terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. However, the people at Williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at Dartmouth, which I've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what I've picked up from the vlogs I've watched and things I've heard. Williams concerns me a bit because I have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. However, Dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.

&#x200B;

That brings me to greek life. From what I have heard, Dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. I have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. I don't really think I would enjoy frats and I'm even more concerned since if admitted I will be on lots of financial aid so I don't know if I'll be able to afford to join one if I wanted to down the road. I have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. I'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I know this is really stupid, but the ivy league pReStIGe is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about Williams but most people know about Dartmouth. I am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but I was wondering if the Ivy League branding that comes with Dartmouth really matters in the future?

I would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between Williams and Dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school. Thank you in advance to all who reply!",h9uj55l,"Hi u/LethalVenom1,

I hope your college app journey is off to a good start.  Echoing u/14thethumb's comment on the same post to r/dartmouth, I think you're putting too much thought into the wrong things right now.  As a preface to my thoughts, I remind you that both Williams and Dartmouth are ""under-graduate centered"" particularly because the schools provide myriad resources for their students to explore different academic arenas before committing to any one career path.  This can be incredibly valuable, and I encourage you to keep this is mind if these two schools are your top choices.

&#x200B;

Something I can vouch for as a current Williams student are the small class sizes and availability of research.  Professors are accessible and, for the most part, invested in students' academic trajectories.  The tutorial classes offered can be very fun - I took two in my first year at the College and had no regrets - courses where I had perhaps my most intimate and productive academic discussions with a professor out of all my classes.  I'd describe classes at Williams as Ivy-level education but with the bonus of accessible professors, more office hours, engaging discussion-based lectures, and incredibly detailed feedback on your tests and assignments - features not always afforded at larger HYPSM schools.

&#x200B;

>'While Dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at Williams making it easier to break in.""

This is where I lost you. Understand that both schools attract top firms and graduate schools each year - at this level, playing the numbers game isn't going to matter.  What you need to look at are the big things: Dartmouth has a dedicated business school, and Williams does not.  I'd imagine Dartmouth's attention to pre-professional programs influences the larger percentage of its graduates who choose to enter consulting after graduation.  That being said, Williams has an incredible Economics and Math department - rest assured, both schools will prepare you for your current career trajectory.  As a Williams student, I'm afraid I'm not in the position to provide any specifics about the quality of Dartmouth courses (or the D-Plan) for your prospective major - I'm sure your crosspost will help you out with that.

&#x200B;

In terms of location, the two schools are similar.  Williams is situated in the bucolic Purple Valley of the Berkshires, and Dartmouth is nestled in the cozy community of Hanover.  You can't go wrong.  Since Williams does not have Greek life, parties and gatherings will take place mostly in dorms or on off-campus housing, and it's relatively quiet and unobtrusive compared to some notorious fraternities at Dartmouth.  Despite the small student population, I've never felt isolated at Williams, nor did I feel like I got to know everyone in the first week of classes.  For me, it's the right size.  I know that feeling is not universal.  One thing I noticed quickly at Williams was the lack of a competitive grade culture.  Williams students are no stranger to stress, but I found we actually bonded over the late nights and difficult tests instead of competing with one another.  Many professors reinforce this collaborative environment with engaging discussions and, in smaller classes, specific attention to each student.  (I've had several classes that have taken place outdoors, and professors who walk campus with their students and regularly invite them into their homes to speak about life!)  It made me so much more comfortable working around others and discussing classes without feeling like it was a constant race for the grade (which, trust me, gets old really fast after you leave high school).

&#x200B;

The most important thing I can convey to you as you finalize your ED schools: talk to current students.   I remember in my own college search having read every online review on College Confidential, r/ApplyingToCollege, and Niche that I could find and stewing over the stats for each school.  This will waste your time.  Talk to real students and ask them about their experiences.  At this stage, I think hearing those stories may help with your final decision.

&#x200B;

Williams College is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a rigorous and uniquely personal academic experience surrounded by natural beauty.  I always liked to walk back from my Economics office hours late at night and look up at the stars - such little light pollution in the Purple Valley makes for some incredible night skies.  On my way to my art history class, I would always walk through the cow pasture on Stone Hill and hang out with them for a bit before heading to the Clark Institute.  Cows?  On a college campus!  Perhaps that anecdote only reinforces the fact that Williamstown truly is in the middle-of-nowhere, but how cool is that?

&#x200B;

I wish you the best of luck - we'd love to have another Eph on campus!",12.0,parabolicpineapple,h9ugv73,"I am not a current student myself,  but I am the parent of a current student and I am an alumna.

You named what I believe is probably the biggest difference between the culture of the two colleges: fraternities vs. zero fraternities.

Williams has a warm and inclusive feel, aided by structures like the freshman ‚Äúentry‚Äù system. An entry is a group of about 40 students living in the same dorm, sharing three or four unpaid junior advisors who have no disciplinary role whatsoever but function like big brothers/ sisters. The entry system gives every new freshman people to eat with and hang out with from the moment you arrive on campus. ‚ÄúSnacks‚Äù is a tradition of meeting more formally as an entry every Sunday night, but entrymates also go together to plays and concerts and sporting events on campus, and to things like art museums and hikes and apple picking off campus... not to mention eating dinner together or hanging out and studying in the Common Room. The Ephventures orientation program gives you an intense multiday experience exploring the surrounding area, whether by van or by backpacking/camping (freshmen choose their program) that also creates yet another friend group.

Parties at Williams are open to everyone- part of the no-frat thing-  but there is still a lot of drinking going on, especially freshman year. Still, there are many people who either attend parties to hang out but just don‚Äôt drink OR who hang out with their friends attending campus cultural events or just hanging out casually in the dorms.

It is also really easy to join a club or activity at Williams.

Williams actually has great connections in investment banking and consulting, the biggest-name firms (McKinsey, Bain, etc.) come to the campus to recruit, and it is a very popular career choice for Williams students. But Dartmouth is also extremely strong in this area.

A tutorial is, indeed, an amazing experience!  With a very few exceptions (think intro courses in psychology and art history), Williams classes are small and discussion-oriented. And professors are excellent and very accessible.

You mentioned the math and economics departments. Students at Williams love the math department, which is known for its friendly and playful environment as well as being intellectually challenging and good. And economics is the most popular major at Williams.

You said campus matters to you. Williams has a pretty campus in that it has great views of the surrounding mountains. But I think Dartmouth has nicer buildings and a more unified look overall, although the Williams library is impressive and the library quad with its marble blocks is very nice.

The Williams name will be admired by grad schools and by certain employers, such as those in  investment banking or management consulting. In terms of the general public, yes, the Dartmouth name is better known, and if they don‚Äôt know Dartmouth, they will be impressed if you tell them it‚Äôs Ivy League. Whereas your cashier at the local grocery store or your gas attendant or your Great Aunt Sally may never have heard of Williams and not know that it‚Äôs a good school. Generally, there is one of two reactions to saying you go to Williams: ‚ÄúWow, that‚Äôs such a great school!‚Äù or a blank look and maybe a question, ‚ÄúDo you mean William and Mary? Roger Williams?‚Äù

Both Williams and Dartmouth are outstanding colleges. Good luck in the application process. I hope this helped a little, but hopefully you also will hear more directly from current students at both schools.",9.0,Wordwoman50,,,,

Ultimately, I don‚Äôt think that there are really any objective ‚Äúcons‚Äù to Williams. Rather, you have to look at aspects such as class size, environment, teaching style, etc. to determine whether or not it fits you.

In terms of academics, for example, Williams is geared towards one-on-one teaching with tutorials and small class sizes. Its quality of education is top-notch, but this style will not suit everyone. Williams is also located in a more rural area with a small population, albeit with beautiful surroundings for nature lovers.

Ultimately, I chose a school with a larger class size and a more active city because I prefer that environment (this was my biggest factor), but it varies for everyone.

I'm excited to hear that you're considering applying here! There's a lot to say about Williams, and I've only been here during the pandemic, so my time here isn't representative of the standard Williams experience. However, I'll share what I feel about the school!

Life at Williams has been great personally. There are a lot of reasons for this, but I guess it boils down to the people and the size of the school. Almost everyone I've met at Williams is tremendously friendly and is interesting to talk to. Unlike my high school, I haven't really felt the vibes of ""cliques"". There are obviously friend groups but I feel like they're a lot less pronounced at Williams. You meet people through different contexts all the time and a lot of people have friends who are involved in different activities, academics, etc. The entry system is a great conduit for this as well. Basically, around 30-40 of frosh live together and have activities like Sunday snacks (which is food + an activity) at a minimum or other things like dinners, dances, movie nights, etc. Some people don't like their entry, which is unfortunate but valid. There are other ways to make friends too, like through a club or classes. 

On top of your standard array of sports options and extracurricular interests, there are a lot of cultural and minority groups on campus as well, which help foster a sense of community and belonging. Because Williams is relatively small, you often see your friends or acquaintances walking around campus. It's kinda nice to just go out for a meal and end up catching up with someone you haven't seen in a while or just waving at people. Another thing I'm starting to find funny is how many friends you make that you end up being mutual friends with another one of your friends.

Classes have also been great! At least for me so far, all my profs have been super friendly and welcoming. You can tell they want to teach you and that they genuinely care. Divisional requirements might be annoying sometimes, but I do appreciate them for incentivizing me to branch out. People are pretty studious because classes at Williams do take time and can be intense! There are a lot of cute study spots on campus (having said that I'm usually too lazy to go to them lol). People do have fun though and there tends to be a decent amount of parties on weekends. I'm not much of a partier myself, but I found a group that I just hang out w/ when people tend to party/get drunk.

The food is meh. It's not bad by any means (I like it) but a lot of people have mixed feelings about it. Could be hit/miss but the dining staff does seem really nice and open to feedback and improving themselves. There's one street on campus that has a few shops and restaurants, which is kinda cute. The most popular shops include a Thai/Japanese restaurant, Indian restaurant, pizza place, and a market/cafe. 

In my first two months on campus I used to joke there's a scenic view everywhere I looked, especially during fall. There's a lot of accessible hiking trails and campus is very pretty. The downside to being rural though is that cities are a decent distance away. Boston and NYC are around 3+ hours away and can be cumbersome to travel to. There are free buses to North Adams (the nearest city) but it is still pretty rural as a whole. I never found this too much of an issue for me because I felt like for the most part, I was kept busy between classes, extracurriculars, and friends. 

Some Williams specific traditions are Mountain Day and Winter Study. Mountain day happens on a random Friday in October where the weather is good. Classes are cancelled and there are hikes of various intensities all day. It's a pretty fun time! Winter Study takes place during January. Basically we take 1 class (can be serious or for fun) and just spend time with friends on campus. 

I've kinda been rambling but I'm happy to elaborate/answer any specific questions you may have lol

10. will be a certified yoga teacher so I guess that will come into play

&#x200B;

So far these are the changes that I will bring to my application. Will be a real help to me if you could provide your feedback on it.

&#x200B;

P.S. I am an international student and my EFC will remain the same as last year which is around$5k and will apply under ED1 for this fall.",h2gt2ml,"I think those changes will help you out. There's one thing that I think could help you out even more, actually! :)
So, I noticed you've been doing a lot of different activities. Yoga, teaching English, website, research paper, and dance... you've got a really diverse skillset. I think it could make for a really strong application if you found some way to tie those activities together in an essay or some other piece of writing, if there's any connection that can be made. For example, imagine writing like, ""I really like helping others, and by teaching this kid English and teaching others yoga, I've been able to help people with both the mental and physical parts of life. I hope to do more like this for others at Williams."" Or something like that haha. When a person ties together the different things they do, it can make them seem like a super powerful character or something, haha

Btw, how come you're planning on making slight changes to the common app essay? Do you feel like it was a good essay and you just wanna tweak a few things, or do you think the Williams peeps didn't like it? I think the essay can be a really strong point to win over the advisors, so I'd recommend showing it to peeps like friends and teachers and see what others think. I'd love to help out with that if I can--you can always DM me for any help with this stuff :) I don't check my reddit very often, but since it's a couple months until the 2022 application opens, I'm sure I could help you out <3

Let me know what you think of my thoughts, I hope they helped :)",1.0,betacux,,,,,,,,

Background: 

I'm on financial aid and I just learned you can change the amount of money you pay thru a campus job. The original amount for me is $2700 but my assumption is that I can earn more than that. But before I decide for myself I want to know how much ppl actually earn so I can adjust my plan accordingly. 

Any broad estimate or your own experience would be helpful. Thanks!",h1538yf,"The max amount of time you can work per week on campus is 10 hrs, and the school‚Äôs rate for students is right around minimum wage, I believe. Current min wage in MA is $13.5, so you could make at a minimum $1350 per semester, $2700 per year (10 hrs per week * 10 weeks per semester ‚Äî actual semester might be a little longer). 

I‚Äôve worked 10 hrs/week for the past 2 years, and have typically made >3k each year. I would recommend looking for ‚Äúfull-time jobs‚Äù ‚Äî these will be 10 hr/wk jobs ‚Äî as opposed to jobs being paid hourly because oftentimes you are paid a fixed rate but don‚Äôt end up actually working ‚Äúfull-time.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt on financial aid so someone please correct me if the situation is different for those that are!",4.0,dby1014,h15faht,"I went to Williams a long time ago, so my advice is likely not relevant, but in general Williams was wonderful about financial aid. I was expected to pay about that each year, which I easily could do out of my summer job. So I gave up my first on-campus job after my first semester (lifeguard‚Äîhad to work early in the morning so it was rough). After that I picked up TA jobs which paid okay, but were great (looked good on CV, helped me build relationships with professors, and I could do largely on my own time (mostly graded problem sets).
Just make sure you look into everything (Gina coal aid office can help). I was very worried about money when I first got in campus, so I switched to one of the cheaper meal plans. But then next year my aid only included that level of meal plan but my contribution was the same‚Äîso I should have just stayed on the unlimited plan.
I remarkably left Williams with only about $5k in loans, which I was able to pay off right away. I fared so much better than my friends and for that I am so thankful!",2.0,ColaRBT16,h164kcy,"According to Williams policy you‚Äôre not supposed to work more than 10 hrs/week.

Mountain Day. Classes cancelled on a surprise Friday in October so that everyone can go hike up a mountain.

Once a semester, each student gets to invite a favorite professor to a special dinner. Apart from that, professors often dine/ spend time with students, and professors may invite their classes to their homes for dinner.

Freshman entry system and Ephventures orientation system ensure you meet people quickly as a freshman. ‚ÄúSnacks‚Äù is a formal Sunday night tradition bringing the entry together once a week, but entries do a whole lot of other stuff together during the year. The Ephventures orientation program is really fun, whether you are doing something like ‚ÄúWhere Am I‚Äù when you explore what‚Äôs available in the beautiful area from world-class art museums to local stores to short drives or walks to lovely waterfalls and viewpoints, or you are doing something more intense like a few nights‚Äô backpacking trip in the mountains (you choose your type of orientation program).

Opportunities based on the school‚Äôs endless resources and its loyal alumni: alumni-funding for any unpaid internship you get, alumni network, funding for whatever your club/organization wants to do, funding for research/ travel aboard/ etc., financial aid covers all your textbooks plus weird incidentals like skiing and snowboarding equipment rentals for PE classes and a suit for job interviews.

Winter Study- educational travel trips, individually designed projects can be approved, alumni-run practical courses‚Ä¶ plus informal ‚Äòcourses‚Äô run by students for students in things like cooking or jitterbug dancing.",1.0,Wordwoman50

2. I think it is a very rigorous and intense school, but it is ultimately very rewarding -- the work doesn't feel excessive or like drudgery, and the education sets you up well for anything later in life. In terms of work-life balance, however, that ultimately depends on the student but there is a lot of opportunity to do things that aren't just schoolwork -- sports, arts, performances, student groups, etc. The school does provide a lot of funding and faculty support for extracurricular endeavors.

mjz30g,Any current students that had to decide between Williams and Pomona?,15,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/mjz30g/any_current_students_that_had_to_decide_between/,1,2021-04-04 16:06:15+00:00,Havashahaba,Sorry I know it‚Äôs specific but if anyone had to make this choice or one like it I‚Äôd love to know why you ended up picking Williams.,gtghdll,"I was in this position, and I chose Williams for a few reasons. I skimmed through the answers to your post in the Pomona subreddit, so I'll try to respond to those as well. Disclaimer: they're both great schools, so the choice is likely going to depend more on your own preferences and situation than on qualities of either school.

1. The tutorial system, as well as WEPO (one of the only study abroad programs at Oxford that grants you equal status to a student there), are pretty awesome. I've taken a ton of tutorials at Williams thus far, and it's definitely been one of the defining and most positive aspects of my education here, if not *the*. That being said, not everyone finds tutorials attractive; I happened to, so that was a strong push toward Williams.
2. Williams *is* cold and isolated, but weirdly enough, I wanted that. I come from the west coast, and I was looking to explore a new part of the country. I also love nature, so being surrounded by trees and trails rather than suburbia was ideal for me. The weather isn't great, but it was fun for me to see snow for the first time (admittedly, I've gotten tired of it since...). I also was looking for a really beautiful campus, and I found that more in Williams than in Pomona.
3. My financial aid packet at Williams was slightly better than at Pomona.
4. Personally, I wasn't all that excited by the Claremont Consortium. My majors were best suited for classes at Pomona, so I didn't envision myself wanting to attend classes at other schools. (This is also why I didn't find myself very attracted to Amherst and its consortium). If anything, I was slightly worried that I'd have to face more competition to get into Pomona classes -- but I have no idea if this is true or not.
5. It's true that Williams has a large student athlete body. But if you're not into sports -- like me -- don't worry, since literally no one cares. Especially not recently.
6. I'd imagine that Williams and Pomona are nearly identical in terms of how intellectual its students are. So that probably won't be your deciding factor.
7. One person in the Pomona subreddit cited Pomona's career center in favor of it. I can't speak to the difference between Pomona and Williams here, but I can say that Williams also has a program that pays students for otherwise unpaid internships, and that the alumni network at Williams is super active (it's apparently the oldest in the world -- why, I don't know). Also, the most common employer of Williams students, last I checked, was Google -- take that as you will...
8. Some things I'll concede about Williams: not great diversity (though it looks like we're moving in a better direction, with identity-based housing slotted to come next semester), no easy access to big cities (Boston and New York are both 3-4 hours away, although Williams provides somewhat subsidized travel there on weekends), and not great weather.

mi3re5,Going into foreign policy after Williams?,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/mi3re5/going_into_foreign_policy_after_williams/,8,2021-04-01 20:05:16+00:00,vaeporwave,"Hello,

I was wondering if it is easy for Williams undergrads to go into foreign policy (e.g. working in global affairs for the Government, working at a Think Tank, etc.) after they graduate. Are there students at Williams who have these aspirations, and how successful are they with their goals?

The reason I am asking is because Williams doesn‚Äôt have an international relations/global affairs major. However, in every other way besides major offerings, Williams is my dream school (I hope that makes sense). I was thinking the best supplement for international relations is a major in economics and a concentration in global studies. However, I want to know if I would have a solid shot at going into the foreign policy world with a degree from Williams or should I look elsewhere?

Thank you so much for your help.",gt51o9n,"This is a very common path, and Williams is very well-connected in government, law, and policy. Williams has one of the highest number of current alumni serving in office (4 in the House of Representatives, 1 senator, tons of state congresspeople, a few members of the extended presidential cabinet, etc.), not to mention the College is very well-respected in DC and several prominent lobbying/PR firms and law firms were founded by Williams alumni. There is an annual trek to DC that the career center organizes (paid for by the College) where students go to DC and meet alumni working in government, policy, and think-tanks. I can give you more info on how well Williams is represented on Capitol Hill to assuage any concerns you may have, but given how strong the alumni network is and how well alumni do in this field, Williams will give you a huge advantage when trying to enter this field down-the-line.

Generally speaking, the political science major at Williams works like this -- you major in Political Science, but you have to specialize in one of four subfields (international relations, political theory, etc.). Additionally, you can also concentrate in global studies and/or double-major in a language/ethnic studies, leadership studies, etc. Further, there is a Political Economy major, which is fairly unique, and is essentially a Public Policy major, and you can double major in PoliSci and Econ if you were interested in both. The major itself is really flexible like that.

Lastly, Williams offers tremendous opportunities outside of academics to gain exposure to foreign policy, policy research, etc. Williams showers undergrads with grants for research, travel, foreign language study, policy research, etc., and this aspect of Williams can't really be found at other colleges. All-in-all, Williams will help you tremendously with trying to enter the foreign policy/government field.

Hope this was helpful-- happy to elaborate on any questions you may have.",7.0,Farquaado,gt3dne2,"I‚Äôm just a student, so not really a super knowledgeable source, but I‚Äôd say a Williams education would set you up extremely well for such a career, given the catalog of courses available and the presence of the CDE. I don‚Äôt have statistics, but anecdotally I‚Äôve known a few people who went into such careers after graduation and afaik are doing well.

A lot of political science classes at Williams are very much foreign policy related as well. I think a major in political science or political economy coupled with electives in economics, sociology, and environmental studies might be your best option.

Economics is a bit more abstract and quantitative than I think a lot of people realize before coming, especially in the core courses.",3.0,Stone2443,gt5kdke,"You've gotten some good responses here, but I just want to add that if you're interested in foreign policy at Williams you're right, there is no specific global affairs program, but Williams prides itself on staying at its Liberal Arts roots.

It's not a school where many people specialize early on. Sure you have some people going on one path early and sticking to it, but you can save your specialization for your graduate program. I would recommend using Williams as a place to learn how to learn, and a place to expand your horizons. You want to take courses from professors that interest you, and courses you might not have chances to take in the future. 

As was mentioned elsewhere Williams has connections and courses that will set you up well for a career in politics both foreign and domestic. But take your time working out how you want to achieve those goals. You could go into public policy, go into a think tank, get a masters or phd degree, get a law degree and practice, or even use Williams as a jumping off for a political career. My one recommendation would be to not limit yourself because they don't have 'X' major. Take your time, experiment with courses and professors and with your idea of what you want to do. Then when you find your direction you'll have the network and skills to make that idea reality. 

I hope that helps and isn't too vague or long winded! Good luck! Also that guy who just said those jobs don't exist is an idiot lol.",2.0,None

Do tutorials count as a class? How do they fit into the 4-1-4 system? Do students typically take one per year? Sorry for so many questions.,gictc1t,"Hey! I'm an ED '25 admit and I wrote this essay :) You can make up any class you want -- it doesn't have to be one that's already in the curriculum. Once you decide what you'd want to learn, definitely focus in on just that idea. Choose something that highlights an interest of yours (writing about your intended major would be good, unless it's already represented in your commonapp essay, in which case choose a different academic interest).

krewgt,Tutorials at Williams,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/comments/krewgt/tutorials_at_williams/,6,2021-01-06 03:08:49+00:00,legoWolf13,"I‚Äôm applying to Williams and I want to know about students‚Äô experiences with tutorials, for example taking multiplie tutorials, quality, overlap with classes. I plan on being a math major btw. Thanks!",gi9mokp,"I‚Äôve taken one tutorial in the philosophy department and plan on taking another in the spring. It was an incredibly valuable educational experience. I felt like I learned more in that class that I have in any other class ever. That said, it can be very difficult (depending on who‚Äôs teaching and what department) and I imagine two tutorials is a bad idea (just overly burdensome). I spent more time on my tutorial than most of my other classes (almost combined). And the thing with a tutorial is you basically always have to do the work really well so you can‚Äôt ‚Äútake a week off‚Äù like you can in a lecture or seminar.",5.0,jsbsbdjdb,gi9pc6c,"Favorite tutorial was a biology tutorial in genome sciences. Read a ton of papers and discussed them in depth with my partner. I had a really good experience because my partner and I were friends and equally engaged in the material so we would actually meet up to talk, go over stuff, etc. I had a bio heavy semester at the time so there was definitely lots of overlap (biochem, ecology, evolution, genomics). I never got around to taking a physics tutorial... those seemed very fun and challenging, maybe that‚Äôs more down your alley.",5.0,Last_Eph_Standing,gi9vlq7,"Both of my tutorials were film-related, one called The Video Essay and one called Out of Africa: A Cinematic Por(be)trayal of a Continent. They were both fantastic for me. The former was more concentrated on writing and producing high-quality film analysis in a cinematically-stylized video essay, so I developed the ability to use Adobe Premiere for something serious and quite meaningful instead of the many goofy things I had done in it before. The latter was more concentrated on reading theoretical texts and reading films as texts. Because there was so much emphasis on reading (visual and written texts), I feel like my ability to analyze films within their real life contexts grew so much from that class. Both great courses run by knowledgeable professors who know how to utilize the Tutorial format to optimize the subject they are teaching. Since the meetings themselves require you to put so much work in to prepare, they are that much more thrilling since you really come to know the kind of dynamic you, your partner, and your professor have together. Williams is hard and hard to keep up with, but I‚Äôm not kidding when I say those courses kept me excited and engaged throughout.

I just realized you said you plan on becoming a math major so I hope there‚Äôs something to glean from all of that. Tutorials are rigorous no matter what, so whatever department you take them in you‚Äôll find a uniquely incredible environment to learn in. Best of luck with your application!",3.0,ODBoBSTER

1) I will be applying as a CS major. How is the CS major at Williams? What are the internship opportunities, job placements, and grad school placements like?

2) What are the best and worst things about Williams?

Thank you!",gggi543,"1. Fellow CS major here, although only in my first year. I came in with high expectations, but my expectations have *still* been exceeded. I took the standard second-year CS course (Computer Organization), and the course was excellent. It was challenging, interesting, and enlightening. As far as job opportunities go, the CS department does a stellar job at communicating available opportunities. They frequently send out emails with information about various opportunities for internships and post-graduate research programs. There are also many extremely intelligent CS majors. In conclusion, the Williams CS program does not disappoint.

2. Unfortunately, this question is very difficult to answer, because the ""best and worst things"" are just so dependent on who you are as a person. Some might say that it's the ""jock"" atheltic culture, which comes from 30% of the school being recruited athletes. Others seem to feel that the school is ""stifling"" due to being in a relatively isolated area. For me, neither is actually a problem, and I actually really enjoy the location of Williams.

The department is strong but there aren't a lot of music majors, so at least in my day everyone who was had pretty specialized interests. If you think you have an exceptional talent as well as a strong overall application, that's a profile that would have been a good candidate for admission. 

If you feel *that* strongly that you have something special to offer and that Williams is the right place to explore it, I don't think it would be bad at all to email a professor or adjunct in the music department whose interests overlap with yours.

Each applicant is admitted for their unique strength and bring something to the table.   


So, everyone is different, and stats alone say nothing. Some tips would be to show how you're different and unique. Think about these:  
What makes you, YOU and not anyone else? How are you different than any other applicant? Why should a college take you in? While it's true you gain a lot from the college, try thinking about what the college can gain from admitting you and having you as their student?

I wanted to know what your workload is (hours of study/work a day/week, how many pages of assigned reading a week, etc). Do you find the workload draining/difficult to keep up with? Is it mostly busy work or do the assignments demand a lot from you to get them done? Any information in this vein would be incredibly helpful. I can‚Äôt wait to go to your school, and I‚Äôm genuinely honored to get the chance to.

Thanks again :)",gertg40,"Hi, congrats on getting in! I‚Äôm just about through my first sem here and the workload has definitely been the defining aspect of my life here‚Äîthat‚Äôs not to say I haven‚Äôt had time to do anything fun (I‚Äôve made some
of my best memories this semester!), but my plans to generally revolve around making sure I have time to complete assignments. Compared to most of my friends, I seem to have a pretty heavy workload, and how much you have to do definitely depends on number and level of classes. 

I‚Äôd say almost none of the work is busy work, I find myself genuinely having to think about most everything I turn in which is probably the biggest difference between college work and high school work. There‚Äôs also a lot that isn‚Äôt necessarily turned in, but needed for apt class participation or understanding. There have been a few especially rough weekends with psets and a few hundred pages of reading (at least with my schedule, Wed-Fri tend to be more like weekends than the actual weekend) but there are also days with practically nothing. Be prepared to read entire books weekly or even over the period of a day or two. 

Overall, as long as you‚Äôre coming here with the mindset that you‚Äôre here to work, you should be fine! If you prioritize other things ahead of your work, you can certainly still succeed, you may just find yourself pressed for time in ways you‚Äôd rather not be. 

I hope this helps! I‚Äôm very open to talking about my experience here so far so feel free to pm if you have any other questions!

As a final note, I will say that some people have managed extremely low workloads this semester by playing off of the fact that we only had to take 3 classes this sem and many were remote, but I imagine this is not indicative of a normal semester.",10.0,Justyn_With_A_Y,ges647u,"Yay!! Congrats and welcome to Williams :))

To take your points one by one: 

Please don't be intimidated by the prestige of Williams! Once you get to campus, you'll realize that 'prestige' is a pretty meaningless concept and, at least for me, entirely irrelevant to anything I've ever done at Williams. No one on campus ever gloats about our prestige -- thank god -- and the rest of the world hardly knows that we exist, so I really wouldn't worry about anything of that sort.

Imposter Syndrome is, unfortunately, very common at Williams; there's definitely an unhealthy ideal of effortless perfection. As far as I can tell, it's something the student body, faculty, and administration all know about. A lot of students come from big-fish-small-pool type situations, so many have an implicit expectation to remain the best at everything they do, which is neither possible nor the point of going to college. All I can say is that you've just been admitted, so don't stress about this kind of stuff: I can promise you that you *definitely* belong at Williams! 

Workload varies by person, of course, but almost everyone I know has fairly busy schedules. In my experience -- and I believe this is pretty standard -- my workload has increased every year, if not every semester: you start taking harder classes, get involved in more extracurriculars, perhaps pick up a job or two, etc. All this can 100% be draining, especially during finals (which are coming up, ugh!). Throughout my time at Williams, I've had to make active decisions about how I wanted to juggle my time, e.g. going to less parties to get more work done instead. It does help, though, that most of my work is genuinely interesting. And yeah, for the most part the work is pretty serious, especially, I think, in higher level classes. 

That being said, please know that Williams students still have fun! Figuring out how to balance everything can take time, but you'll get the hang of it. If you're worried about this, my one tip would be to give yourself a relatively light first semester, so that you can adjust as smoothly as possible.",7.0,RaunchyAir,gesa1v1,Were you a QuestBridge applicant?,4.0,SpongeBobBlab

Here's the good news, you can't make a wrong choice here. Both schools give you a good education, have thought provoking and caring professors, and a vibrant student body. The upside of Colby is that because they are so intensely remote there is a very strong campus connection. This is true at Williams as well, but moreso at Colby. The benefit of Williams is easier access to places like Boston etc. if you want to get away even though it is still remote and in the mountains for the most part.

Williams bills itself as a ""need blind"" school like many other highly selective US colleges. However, I heard from students at Columbia and Penn (other need blind selective colleges) that they and a lot of their classmates were advised to apply for aid **after** they received their acceptance letter. They claimed that these colleges were, in fact, not need blind in practice. A student who got in Penn ED waited until May to apply for financial aid, and a student at Columbia I know said that a lot of their class applied after their acceptance. All students mentioned were domestic, and I am a domestic applicant.

In fact, Ivy Coach wrote a [blog post about it](https://www.ivycoach.com/the-ivy-coach-blog/college-admissions/2-reasons-need-blind-admissions-farce/) where they called need blind admissions a ""farce,"" claiming that ""colleges are not need blind as they may suggest so freely to applicants and their parents. Now there are a couple schools that are straightforward ‚Äî they‚Äôre open and honest about being need aware. But all of those colleges that claim to be need blind, they too are need aware. They‚Äôre just not as honest about it."" as well as ""If a college actually did this, that college would not be able to sustain itself. It would have to dip into its endowment. Tuition is vital to highly selective colleges. It‚Äôs why tuition fees are so high. Schools would never make this error. They take need into consideration, even though they say just the opposite.""

Williams students who receive aid, is there really a disadvantage to applying for aid with your application? If so, can a student who gets in Early Decision apply for aid after acceptance? Will this impact the award in every way? 

Stay safe, y'all.",g1twhqm,"Around 50% of the school receives financial aid. It seems unlikely that Williams is need aware if that is the case. Furthermore, I personally feel that Williams administration is highly benevolent and transparent, so I would be extremely surprised if there was anything sketchy surrounding financial aid admission practices. Anecdotally, I was admitted to the school (although off the waitlist) despite requiring financial aid. 

I think that the sentiments that ""need blind admission is a farce"" may stem from certain deceptive practices that other schools exercise. For example, it is believed that the UChicago waitlist is not need blind, despite the fact that regular admission is. Therefore, in the case of UChicago, it would probably be better to submit your financial aid after you submit your application. Fortunately, Williams explicitly states that their waitlist is need blind, so I believe there is nothing to worry about regarding Williams.",5.0,KenVatican,g1ws1uy,"There are two ways in which one could argue that Williams is not need-blind.

1. They are not need-blind for international students. They openly state this.
2.

When it comes to this, it might actually be more appropriate to say the college is ""need-seeking"", but that ""need blind"" would still be appropriate in that no domestic applicant would never not get in bc. they need financial aid.

It's very unlikely that Williams would be lying about being need-blind.

Our county (understandably) had a lot of equity issues to address (some students don't have Wi-Fi in the home), so we're trying to figure out how Williams transitioned into distance learning. We are still hoping that students will be allowed back on campus, even if it's with a bunch of rules and guidelines to follow, but just in case...",fv0gniz,"People‚Äôs experiences were very different, but I can give my take as someone who has easy access to a high-speed internet connection and who took mostly math and computer science classes last semester. 

Largely, academically, the transition was fine for me. All of my classes were lecture based. The one class that I had that relied more on group work was transitioned toward a tutorial format, which was fantastic and which I hope many professors try if the fall semester ends up being virtual (and I‚Äôve given that feedback to the college). That change definitely gave me a better relationship with the professor, created accountability (because you‚Äôre accountable to your group mates and have to have something to show for your work in a face-to-face meeting with the prof once a week) and probably enhanced my learning of the material. 

For the classes that relied only on recorded lectures, it was tougher. I was able to keep myself accountable and watched them more or less on schedule, but I understand that it would be harder overall for some people. I also don‚Äôt have too much trouble learning from someone talking at me, but other people who really prefer discussion, q&a, and breakout sessions as part of their learning experience would have been disappointed. 

Finally, the logistics of TA sessions and office hours were different. Arguably, TA sessions and office hours are easier to attend virtually, but there is a lot that is lost in virtual TA sessions. I was a TA last semester, and attendance dropped drastically after the transition. I had like 13 students every Tuesday night, the atmosphere in the room was great, people collaborated on problems on the blackboard. After the transition, I had one or two students each week, who mostly just asked one question and then logged off. Also, if you‚Äôre not up to date with the lectures, then TA sessions and office hours can‚Äôt help you much. So if you have trouble keeping yourself on track, or some family emergency or something means you end up cramming in a few weeks of lecture at the last minute, you lose the ability to take advantage of those resources.",8.0,jello34,,,,,,,,

The news is supposed to come out by July 1st. If we're coming back, I think that's a lovely gift -- and certainly something I would've appreciated as a freshman. Here are some options that I think would work (I've ranked them in my order of favorites):

Spring St. Market and Cafe -- *amazing* sandwiches and breakfast/brunch food

Spice Root -- pretty good Indian food, but it's not super authentic 

The Log (or Hot Tomatoes) -- Italian options; I'm not a big fan but others are

Blue Mango (or Korean Garden) -- Asian fusion; again, tasty but not too authentic

Tony's Sombrero (or Coyote Flaco) -- Mexican options; people tend to like Coyote Flaco a lot more but it's off campus. This probably won't be a big deal, since I'd expect everything to be only order-in this semester.

The Purple Pub -- classic pub food, but it's good quality; I put this low since I feel like you pay more and eat less here

Tunnel City Coffee -- it's a nice cafe (good to study at), but it's nothing to write home about. 

Pera -- super expensive

There are a couple other places I'm forgetting: two (?) smoothie places, and maybe some others.",16.0,TheRoyalty,frf9cl4,"When students eat out it‚Äôs usually either at Blue Mango, Spice Root, or The Log (Ramunto‚Äôs).

The Log has really nice atmosphere because of the beautiful historic building (wooden/rustic vibe) and the food is cheap but only OK quality (pizza chain).

Blue Mango (thai) seems to be by far the most popular place for students to go out for dinner but IMO the food is again only OK quality (verges on greasy and bland). 

Spice Root (indian) has decent food and a buffet but can be quite dark inside.

Tunnel City is more of a cafe than a restaurant but is a super popular spot for kids to study and hang out.

Lickety Split is seasonal but is a quite nice and iconic ice cream stand.

Hot Tomatoes is the best pizza in the area by far but is more often ordered takeout.

Korean Garden is in North Adams but deserves mention- a lot of kids make the drive there as they have decent Korean food.

Chopsticks too- solid and cheap Chinese food not far from campus.

Tony‚Äôs serves good and very authentic Mexican food but has a hole-in-the-wall vibe which bothers some students.

Coyote Flaco people say is better Mexican but I‚Äôve never been so can‚Äôt comment. Fairly upscale place I guess.

I'm pretty much set on majoring biology with a concentration in neuroscience but I'm hoping to explore the Cog-Sci program too. I was accepted to a few other universities with more focused neuroscience programs, but Williams is a better fit for me (most colleges have amazing academic/social opportunities, but I know I'll thrive better as an Eph) and I appreciate the ability to pursue a liberal arts education. At Williams, neuroscience is only offered as a concentration and cog-sci as a program. There were less than 20 neuroscience courses, 4 of which are independent studies, and around 5 cog-sci courses, 3 of which are independent studies. I'm worried I might run out of courses to take or won't have enough neuroscience-related research opportunities to pursue, which is concerning because I'm hoping to go to grad school after graduation. If my primary interest is neuroscience and cog-sci, would it be better to go to a research university with a renowned neuroscience program, or do you think Williams has enough resources for me to receive an in-depth education and be a competitive applicant for neuroscience/cog-sci grad school programs?",fp11okb,"If you like the Williams environment, then Williams will be excellent preparation for graduate school in neuroscience/cognitive science, and you would be at a huge advantage when applying for graduate programs down-the-line. To address your concern about the number of courses, first, the majority of students take 32 courses over their four years at Williams, which means you would be very hard-pressed to finish all of the available cognitive and neuroscience courses available. Additionally, while the liberal arts environment encourages taking courses across disciplines, it is also perfectly situated for students such as yourself who know exactly what they want to study; at Williams, you'll have tremendous opportunities to go deep into topics with expert faculty-members, and the research experiences you'll get are rich and intensive. I wouldn't discount the independent study opportunities/thesis opportunities at Williams - graduate schools care a lot more about research than taking a lot of courses in the a particular discipline, and Williams is so well-resourced in terms of faculty and financial resources that you would be showered with attention and opportunities.

In summary, the research opportunities, faculty attention, and resources at Williams will put you at a huge advantage when applying to grad school. In in the off-chance that you find yourself exhausting all of the intellectual opportunities at Williams, you can always take a semester/year to ""study-abroad"" at MIT, Harvard, or Columbia, or you could apply for the Oxford Program and spend a year studying neuroscience/cognitive science at Exeter College in Oxford.",11.0,Farquaado,,,,,,,,
