>But while students are suffering financially, the state’s universities are feeling money pressure too — at least compared to their peers. From 2010 to 2015, Texas ranked last in the nation in total per-student revenue growth at its colleges and universities, according to a study by the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association.

>That’s thanks in part to the shrinking number of dollars per student that Texas is sending its universities. In recent years, enrollment has exploded. Lawmakers in anti-tax Texas have been unwilling or unable to continue funding students’ educations at the same rate as a generation ago. And the Legislature has allowed universities to increase tuition to make up the difference.  

https://www.texastribune.org/2017/02/07/texas-tuition-increasing-state-funding-falling/

The State of Texas is run by a mass of anti-intellectual, anti-college fundamentalists at the gubernatorial and congressional levels. Not all of the State's elected officials would love to strangle one of the greatest mechanisms for individual growth and the breaking down of barriers and biases that exists, but a lot of them would.

I am a graduating senior and about an hour and a half ago finished up my last class. I feel nothing and everything at all. I still remember so much, and have gone through an incredible transformation over the last four years here. I wanted to write down my story briefly for you longhorns; I hope you feel comfortable enough to share something as well. 

I come from a small town in Texas, and about only four of our class came to UT. I roomed for three years with one of my best friends, and came into college in a relationships with my then girlfriend. We broke up mid-way through the first semester and it absolutely crushed me. I spent a lot of time isolating, lamenting and being dejected. I was a pretty bad person and so I felt like it was punishment for me to suffer and not enjoy college. I spent most of my time my first two years just studying. I did not make many friends, and the ones I did make I did not keep up with. I played in a sports club but I only made two good friends (still good friends with both). However, most of my time was miserable - I put on weight, struggled with becoming a better person, felt like I didn't deserve much and just wanted to suffer a lot. It was the only sensation I felt really strongly. I didn't have any friends to confide in and just didn't feel like it was worth it. Although this never hurt my studies - I really enjoyed my classes and felt like my professors were the best people in my life. Additionally, I spent much time reflecting and keeping up a journal (which I still do), and reading books. These two things kept me afloat, and actually made me a better person.  

But I realized that holding grudges against myself was wasting so much energy - I was tired of being so sad on purpose and living a miserable life. I started to eat right, work out in the mornings, took up a part time job on campus, and started saying ""yes"" to life more often. Life didn't change magically change or get amazing - but it did get better. I made a few more friends, got nice internships, expanded my network, stayed healthy, got back into my numerous hobbies, went out more and just...lived life. I never did anything I didn't want to, or felt pressured to do something. I made many great memories, and I am thankful for my pain because it gave me wisdom and through that I grew. I am proud of what my four years meant to me, even though it wasn't the most ideal. All my friends have been supportive in their own capacities, and I have grown close to many professors. Everything isn't fine and dandy, but it is better. 

And now it has all come to an end. I really don't know what will happen with commencement. I really don't think it will go through if I am being honest. I am upset my parents won't get to fulfill their own dream of seeing their son graduate and walk. Or that I won't get to take pictures with my professors and friends at graduation. I plan on writing a letter to every professor, TA, and friend that inspired me and meant something to me. This isn't the end of things though. I will also be back here for my dual Master's program, so I am very thankful I don't have to part ways with Austin and UT yet. This isn't the way I imagined it, but that is okay. I have achieved so much, and I have so much to achieve. 

Thank you for reading. I hope that those who read this also share their story - I would love to read it.",fpszgd3,"I'm just some dude on the internet, but I'm proud of you, and of your school choice.

To summarize my experience here at UT it's been nothing but one pile of bullshit after another. This started the moment I got into college but it's now being exacerbated by online classes. It's like the professors are just spraying a fully automatic UZI with extended mag at students except instead of bullets it's menial assignments. I have actually gotten dumber since I've come to college. Every day I look at the calendar and every day there are more and more assignments due at all hours of the day. All of this for what? A piece of paper so I can work a desk job until I die? I'm tired of ""education"" just being a bunch of nonsense.

UT especially was touted as what was supposed to be the time of our lives, at least by my uncle who graduated in '05, but a lot has changed since then

I hated going to class, I hated waking up every day. I felt an intense visceral loathing for everyone- all the rich kids who went to fancy high schools, etc. (I know that's not everyone, but I was just jealous and bitter).  It was so overwhelming.

 I had some sort of nervous breakdown before midterms every single month due to acute stress, was hospitalized, yada yada. But before the downward spiral into depression and suicide attempts was your line of thinking- the hate. If you are able to, as cliche as it is, I would seek some help.

Even after graduating you often need to start at the bottom and work your way up anyways. Speaking from experience and dealing with my own issues mentally i spent too long retaking classes and getting q drops before realizing it was not the right time for me to be in school. I spent too long realizing that and it’s better to go into college with a certain level of drive for what you want to get out of it. Cause when it sucks, it sucks! I’m in a different place in my life and hope to go back soon to finish my degree for my own reasons and with a fresh perspective instead of being burnt out as fuck with the education system.

But nope. This fucking sucks. I didn't realize being in a class with people i sparsely spoke to would be so much better than in my room in front of desk

I advise you make a calendar and stick to it. Like, all assignments, lectures etc. Its easier to fall behind with online lectures because in many cases, lecture attendance isn't required and you still have access to it later if you skip, so u push it of to do it later. And eventually it piles up and by the time important deadline is close enough, its too late. Its easier for procrastinator to procrastinate when its possible to push things, like online lectures, to later time.

I made a website that details everything, https://austinuniversityhouse.com.

I demanded that they give me the difference in lease rates between them and the new place I had to sign at, $2880, and after a ton of back and forth, they demanded that I take down the website, withdraw all my reviews and complaints as resolved, and never speak about it again before they'll give me that. I told them I would do that after they offered compensation to everyone they did this to, and they refused. They tricked a bunch of people into signing forms saying it was a mutual termination.

I hadn't intended my original tweet to get nearly half as much attention as it did, when I asked if anyone wanted to join it was half me making a joke, half me actually asking. When everyone started asking to join I capped how many people I was going to add to a server to about ten. Im fairly new to Minecraft, so I didn't know how to add anyone to my server at first (process is actually more complicated than I thought), or whether there was a limit to how many people I could add (is there a limit?). A friend and I are currently in the process of getting the Minecraft UT server started, and we'll add as many people as possible. 

I've only been able to complete the outside of Parlin Hall, half of the outside of Calhoun Hall, the courtyard in front of the tower, and a little bit of Littlefield Fountain (not pictured cause it's looking rough so far, she's a work in progress.) It's taken me about four months, this is more of a side project that I like to work on when I have time on my hands. The trees have been a deterrent honestly it's so annoying to make them.

The repica is not perfect, I don't think it's to scale and I'd like to work on that. If anyone has any tips on how to make this whole process easier, any apps I could download that would help the building/add more items I can use to make it look more realistic, or if they wanna go ahead and add some floor plans for the buildings so I can get started on the inside of Parlin Hall/Calhoun Hall that would be awesome!

easier to control your dosage plus L-Theanine is an amino acid from Tea that can help decrease the anxious and stress some might get from caffeine. I have some in my pre-workout and ngl the shit actually works. I can't say I've experienced anxiousness from caffeine so I can't contribute there.
