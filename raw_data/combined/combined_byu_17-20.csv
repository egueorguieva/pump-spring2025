jw291e,The Problems with BYU Contracted Housing,183,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jw291e/the_problems_with_byu_contracted_housing/,99,2020-11-17 21:43:23+00:00,ProdigalPressProvo,"This month our team has been doing some research on the BYU housing market, talking to academics, emailing local real estate brokers, digging through off-campus housing rules, and looking through business records. Everyone knows BYU housing has problems, but it’s time we have a real discussion about the root causes.

Here are a few excerpts from “The Provo Housing Racket” that summarize our findings pretty succinctly:

—

Too often, BYU students are over-charged, abused, and taken advantage of by their landlords. And, despite good intentions, BYU is one of the greatest culprits behind Provo’s broken student housing market.

BYU places significant hurdles in the way of would-be landlords, limiting the supply of available housing and costing students more. First, BYU contracted apartments are required to physically segregate male and female designated units. Since most apartments in the U.S. are gender-neutral by default, a large chunk of housing is written-off on that basis alone. Second, BYU contracted apartments must be located within a certain distance of campus, limiting the geography for BYU housing to a mere 2.7 square miles. That area includes established businesses and married housing, as well as streets and greenspace.

As a result, many BYU apartments are thirty, forty, even fifty years old. Building new is expensive, and the pool of non-BYU contracted housing within the zone is limited. Most newer developments are on the premium side of the market (The Village, College Place, etc.). If students had a wider range of affordable options to choose from, rent would fall and quality would rise.

It’s bad enough that BYU has built a system primed for exploitation—a system where the rules of supply and demand no longer apply, and landlords can count on a captive audience of vulnerable renters. What’s worse is the way that BYU has abandoned its responsibility to protect students. Last winter, BYU moved classes online and told students to go home. Students on-campus were released from their contracts in the dorms without penalties. Students off-campus, however, were left to fend for themselves. BYU did little to pressure complexes to release students from contracts, even though the university could have threatened to rescind BYU approval for non-compliant housing. 

If BYU is going to require students to live in BYU contracted housing with all of the drawbacks that entails—special rules, higher rents, lower quality—BYU needs to do more to protect students. This means:

No more 12-month contracts: require complexes to offer fall/winter contracts since most students leave Provo in April. 

No more monopolies: limit the reach of companies like Redstone Residential that exercise unfair control over the housing market.

Finally, pick sides: when crises like COVID-19 break out, BYU needs to side with students. The university has played neutral for far too long.

Or better yet, BYU should let students live where they want and let the problems work themselves out.",gcnnlk3,"My former roommates and I once compiled a list of our off campus housing manager’s contract violations, submitted them to the BYU Off-Campus Housing office, and were then told by the person in charge we should just hope to “marry rich someday so we never have to rent again.”",76.0,smileandlaugh,gcnsdx6,The downvotes must be from BYU approved landlords,66.0,spelcheckmaster,gcnnf86,"Honestly, amen. My roommates and I drove past a nice new apartment building in Orem the other day and looked up the price just for fun.

dapy7k,My experience as a transgender student with BYU's ID center,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/dapy7k/my_experience_as_a_transgender_student_with_byus/,29,2019-09-29 03:19:18+00:00,soapfestbeth,"Some background: I'm currently a senior attending BYU and discovered that I was trans over the summer (Male to Female). Since transferring isn't really an option for me, I plan on being more open with my gender identity at BYU, and I've already came out to my bishop and a number of professors. Everyone has been pretty supportive so far, which I was not expecting.

Anyway, I wanted to get my ID card updated to reflect my new name and gender presentation. I was a bit hesitant, since I've heard quite a few cautionary tales of LGBT students and the Honor Code Office. I ended up emailing the ID center to verify that what I was doing was kosher.

It turns out that the ID center was totally cool with putting my preferred name on my card and dressing in feminine clothing for my picture. The person I emailed even asked what pronouns I wanted used for me so that when I went in I wouldn't get misgendered. So that turned out really well. Getting the ID card updated was pretty easy too, I simply walked in, took the picture, got my card, and left no questions asked.

In summary, while BYU can still be a tricky place for LGBT students to navigate, things are getting much better for us on campus. If you're a transgender student on campus, you should definitely still weigh the pros and cons of coming out of the closet. I just want y'all to know that (in my experience) the ID center is pretty trans friendly.",f1se0r0,"I got a new ID in October 2017.

em3vln,My experience meeting with an Associate Dean of Students about the beard policy,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/em3vln/my_experience_meeting_with_an_associate_dean_of/,19,2020-01-09 03:26:15+00:00,None,"Hey everyone, I'm a sophomore at BYU who thinks he looks way better with a beard, and my wife and friends agree. So I let my facial hair grow and shave before tests. I hate doing this, because I want to let my beard grow out, so a couple weeks ago I met with the Associate Dean of Students Nathan Ward to discuss the issue of beards.

A quick summary of our meeting: that sucks, there's nothing I or you can do, have an ice cream on us.

In all honesty, my meeting with Dean Ward was very cordial and respectful. I went in knowing that people would have spoken with him before and intended on getting some ideas on official ways I can go about appealing it to people in power. And that's where I hit a brick wall. While I got the feeling throughout the meeting that Dean Ward was on my side and in total agreement, he explained to me in no uncertain terms that there's no way for me to directly contact those in charge of the Dress and Grooming Standards.

He also explained to me who's in charge of them: the First Presidency, Twelve, and a handful of other commissioners who meet to talk about the entire CES once a month. He told me that they were aware of the issues and that they were aware that student sentiment had changed. I asked if he could bring it up, he said that while they do talk about student sentiment about many rules that not even President Worthen can make recommendations on changes to the Honor Code: only the board can ask for recommendations. ie the prophet, his counselors, and 3 or 4 other people. The last time they asked for recommendations? 1991.

I asked him if he could see the policy changing while I'm at BYU (two-ish more years), he said he wouldn't be surprised, but that I shouldn't hold my breath.

After 45 minutes of discussion, I said ""it appears we've hit a brick wall."" Dean Ward chuckled sympathetically, and as a well-intentioned final act of placation, gave me two coupons for free ice cream from Cougar Eats, which I enjoyed with my wife.

As the presidents of the two largest universities in the state of Utah, we are grateful that we have been able to open our student facilities and offer face-to-face classes this fall semester. We thank those who have been compliant with the safety guidelines that have been put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, we are greatly concerned about the dramatic rise in positive cases of COVID-19 in Utah County, particularly among college students. This is both alarming and unacceptable.

We’re concerned not only for your well-being, but also for those in the local community who are affected by the trends we’ve seen in the last week.

Behavior must change. We implore you to stay home except for in-person classes, work, church, and other essentials. We ask that you limit your social interactions to only those within your household and avoid small gatherings where individuals aren’t wearing masks or maintaining physical distance. If you’re feeling sick, stay home. If you've had a known exposure to the virus, may test positive for the virus or are awaiting a test result, follow the quarantine guidelines of state and local health officials. We expect you to follow all safety requirements on campus and all state and local mandates off campus.

If circumstances do not improve within the next two weeks, more dramatic action will be necessary. This may include a two-week quarantine, closing campuses to the public or a complete retreat to all-remote instruction for the rest of the semester.

Please be wise. Your individual choices will make all the difference.

Sincerely,

Kevin J Worthen, BYU President

In Part 1, we concluded that one of the biggest drivers behind BYU's broken student housing market is BYU itself. In Part 2, we will examine Redstone Residential and MHE Real Estate as a case study on the greater Provo student housing market. 

\_\_\_

Most students have no idea who their actual landlord is, and unmasking owners can be a lot like taking apart a Russian Nesting Doll—one shell company after another. Consider the Liberty franchise. According to Utah business records, the Liberty on Freedom complex is owned by Liberty on Freedom (LLC). In turn, Liberty on Freedom (LLC) is owned by Liberty Square West Investors (LLC) and Liberty Square West (LLC). Finally, Liberty Square West (LLC) is managed by **(name redacted to avoid doxxing)**, CEO of MHE Real Estate. A quick look through the MHE Real Estate [website](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/) reveals that MHE is a major player in the Provo housing market, despite the fact that the average renter has never even heard of them.

MHE at least partially owns: Campus Provo, Liberty Square, Liberty on Eighth, and Liberty on Freedom. These are among the largest BYU complexes by bed count. Liberty Square is actually the single largest BYU complex by bed count. 

While MHE owns the apartments, Redstone Residential (a real estate operating company) manages everything from leasing to maintenance and rent collections. In other words: Redstone is essentially a middleman between landlords and renters. Most operating companies take a percentage of revenues, driving up rent and disincentivizing any expensive maintenance or improvements. 

Residents we spoke to at Liberty on Freedom noted aged buildings, shared bedrooms, cramped kitchens, and a single shared bathroom. With utilities, rent comes out to about $400/month.

Before MHE and Redstone, Liberty Square had a vacancy rate of [30-40%](https://mherealestate.com/our-portfolio/student-housing/liberty-square/) during the summer months due to the nature of fall/winter and spring/summer length contracts. Now, Redstone-managed properties almost exclusively offer 12-month contracts, and vacancy has fallen to nearly zero. The burden has shifted from landlords to renters, and students are left scrambling to find replacement tenants for the summer months even though most BYU students leave Provo in April.

Redstone manages about half of all beds at the large BYU complexes and an even greater share of the overall market. Because BYU has kept the barrier to entry for new landlords so high, many students are forced to choose between one Redstone-managed property or another. And if it's not Redstone, it's likely Aspen Ridge. Small landlords are struggling to compete or even get BYU approval.

When COVID hit, the MHE-owned and Redstone-operated Liberty franchise was generally uncooperative with students trying to be released from their contracts or get rent reductions. Meanwhile, Redstone Residential received [between $2-5m](https://projects.propublica.org/coronavirus/bailouts/loans/redstone-residential-inc-3cfaf714208b0bbd8de93d67b90a1a92) in forgivable PPP loans. 

When a few large firms monopolize a market, competition falls and consumers are made worse-off. Granting students access to the open market is the best way to promote competition and loosen the hold of companies like Redstone and MHE.

It's time for BYU to step-up and fix the broken housing market they helped create.",gcv0um4,"This is the review I left for omni apartments, which is owned by red stone:

NEVER LIVE HERE OR ANY REDSTONE MANAGED COMPLEX!!!! This review is as of 10/23/2020. The management is awful. Just in the last two months I’ve lived here I’ve never had as bad of an experience at an apartment than I have now. As of this morning, they booted at least 20 people’s cars after zero notice. No email or anything. I called and texted with no answer. Finally went by the office and they said they did “everything they could” to give us notice, which was nothing. Not even exaggerating.

Also, our toilet was broken when we got here and was constantly running, and pouring out water. Many, many attempts to reach the management both in person and virtually resulted in absolutely nothing. After a month of this, our bill was an extra $40 for just water. BEWARE OF THIS PLACE!!!

Also don’t even try to contact them, I’ve tried email, text, phone call and in person, and have only seen them once. That was today lol.

***edit: I woke up early to get the boot off my car and it already got towed 🙃. What kind of management tows their own tenants (and a student at that) car after no notice?",27.0,averagesizechungus,gcuyil6,"Oh, let me share a story about my time at the Rivera (2 years ago) who is ~~owned~~ *managed* by Redstone Residential. My thoughts at the time of the events are in italics.

My year-long contract there was hell. Don't get me wrong, I loved my roommates and the ward but the management was shady on a good day. Every month we had a cleaning check, whatever I usually had the kitchen to clean as my job. I scrubbed the hell out of that thing every month and I failed at least 6 of the 12 cleaning checks during the year. They looked for any reason to fail you. Funny thing is, they never told you what it was that you failed for. So when the recheck happens like a few days later, they would fail me again and charge me an extra $35 for a ""cleaning"" crew to come. I stuck around all day twice for the ""cleaning crew"" to come. Once it was the main office staff and they cleaned nothing, the second no one showed up. I could have sworn the checkers were paid per fail they gave to cleaning checks with how fail-happy they were.

My final month comes around and I ask the front office if I have to pay my last month's rent and they confidently say ""Yes!"". I wasn't sure if I paid last month's rent in the deposit or not so I asked them to check and they said, No you have to pay last month's rent. So I write the check and didn't think to make sure until a few days later when I checked the contract. I asked for the money back and of course, I had to jump through 1000 hoops to get my damn money back.

And after leaving my miserable experience didn't stop. You know that all-important deposit that complexes force out of you and tell you a certain amount is ""refundable""? Yeah, good luck prying that from their greedy hands when it's time to leave. Final check day came, I left the stupid addressed envelope, stamp, etc. that they ""need"" (otherwise they charge you $3 for it! lol).  About two months pass and I still haven't seen the refundable part of my deposit. So I call the Rivera. They tell me ""Oh, there was an issue with the printer here and YOURS didn't get printed"" (*wonder how many other people's checks ""didn't get printed""*). So they told me to wait a few days, I waited, no one called me back. So I called them, they said they still are having printer issues, (*yeah sure you are*). So they tell me to call/email Redstone about the issue. So I email Redstone Residential and get into a bit of an email battle with the secretary. I wrote her saying that I still hadn't gotten my refunded deposit back, oh, and that last month's rent I paid but I didn't need to. So after almost a week she finally tells me that she will get on it but that she will deduct $50 because I ""failed the final cleaning check"" (*oh WOW, you don't say! /s*). I finally convinced her to give me that damn $50 because they had already gotten $100+ from me during the freaking school year. Then the best part, she also tells me that they are having ""printer issues"" and that I need to come down to the main office to pick up my check. You would think that with the amount of money they took from me for cleaning checks they could fix their damn printers! (*Imagine if I lived outside of the Provo/Orem area during the summer...*) Finally got my money... after 3 months of lots of pestering them.

TLDR;

I was forced to pay a stupid amount of money for monthly cleaning checks that felt like a coin toss. Redstone Residential and other property management companies attempt to swindle any money they can out of the residents. When it came time to uphold their end of the contract and return my refundable portion of the deposit, they looked for any reason to not return the money or keep as much of it as possible.",19.0,Cholojuanito,gcv8oz9,"The way I see it is this:

In the early 2010s when Redstone was founded they recognized the potential to essentially corner the housing market in Provo. Independent complex owners were getting older and looking to cash out and move on with their grandkids etc. They probably got some venture capital and started buying up complexes and houses as they went up for sale. 

What happened next was some pretty impressive growth. From what I could find, in 2013 they were managing 1,300 beds. Now in 2020 they are in the 20,000s. They look like the future of Provo housing, and in my opinion that future is going up--in the quite literal sense. Land is becoming more scarce, I bet that in the next couple years we will see a lot more homes and entire blocks bought out south of campus and big complexes built there.",13.0,butt-hole-eyes

Pro-tip: This is not the first time groups of people with different standards have had conflict.  So what’s the best way to deal with conflict?  Generally, when there is deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement, it’s helpful to agree to disagree.  

By the way, “deep-seated, sincerely-held disagreement” is exactly what this is.  This isn’t Handmaid’s-Tale-style patriarchy trying to oppress you, and it’s not a progressive conspiracy to make you gay.  It’s decent people who genuinely hold one set of values disagreeing with decent people who hold a different set of values.  For the most part.

I have many friends and acquaintances from across the political and social spectrum, and we agree to disagree a lot.  I don’t love the fact that abortions occur, but I have good friends who are one-issue pro-choice voters.  I don’t think Islam is the devil’s scourge, but I go to family reunions with plenty of people who do think that, and I love them dearly.  I think socialism is an atrocious idea, but I haven’t blocked any of my Bernie-loving friends on social media.  Why?  Because we agree to disagree.  We share our opinions, we exchange ideas, and when the day is over, we shake hands and go back to our corners.

By the way, letting the other side “go back to their corner” is an essential part of agreeing to disagree.  Even though I’m pro-life, I’ve never chased an abortion doctor back to his house and picketed his front door.  Because that’s his house.  Even though I’m anti-anti-Islam, I’ve never gone inside my cousin’s rural Baptist church and shouted that everyone needs to stop sending money to Israel and be more open-minded about Islam.  Because that’s their church.  Even though I’m pro-gun, I’ve never gone to a meeting of Moms Demand Action with a firearm slung on my shoulder.  Because that’s their meeting.  Agreeing to disagree means you listen quietly, you state your case, and then you respect the other side’s autonomy.

In summary --  Even if you think homosexuality is a bad idea, don’t go to a gay bar and preach at people.  Nobody forced you to go to the gay bar, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave the people in the gar bar alone.  The gar bar doesn’t exist for you.  And even if you think homosexuality is just fine, don’t go to BYU and protest.  Nobody forced you to go to BYU, and you knew what it was when you walked through the door.  Just leave BYU alone.  There are plenty of universities that don’t think there is anything at all wrong with homosexuality.  Like, ALL OF THEM except BYU.  

I’m NOT saying, “If you don’t like BYU's standards, go somewhere else.”  I’m saying, if you don’t like BYU’s stance on homosexuality, that’s fine!  Stay if you want to.  It’s fine that there are communities that you don’t like.  There are communities that I don’t like.  We don’t have to change everybody we disagree with.  Let BYU’s standards be BYU’s standards.

Respect the fact that different communities see things differently, and leave them alone to do things differently.",fjlk9sa,"Meh I'll hold your feet to the fire on this one. 

Im of the opinion that it's never an all or nothing. I can choose to work for a company but push leadership for better hours or work culture.

Sure many people don't but I've got mad respect for those that do.

I think the greatest changes have come from people that are passionate about things and willing to bring it to places or people that aren't.

I was a convert with a 36 and a 4.0 and I was left feeling shocked and very hurt. I attended another university for a semester, reapplied with the exact same application, and was ultimately accepted for Winter 2019. 

College admissions is a really fickle process. I don't know why you were denied (and if my experience holds, you will never receive a reason...) but I do have a firm belief—bolstered in large part by my rejection experience—that God will aid us in making the best of these twists and bumps in our life plans. I'm sure I could be in a fantastic place in my life right now had I been accepted the first time, but I also know that my life would be drastically different without the attributes I refined as I weathered this ""trial,"" the amazing friends and faculty with whom I connected at my other university, and the people I met here at BYU only because I arrived when and how I did.

Unfollow BYU on Instagram for a few months if you have to, but keep doing all of the wonderful things you did in preparation to gain admittance and striving to be the best person you can be.

Despite following all of BYU's mask and social distancing standards both on- and off-campus, I developed some COVID-like symptoms over the weekend. Per the instructions at [health.byu.edu](https://health.byu.edu) and on the Health Together app, I started self-isolating right away and I called the BYU COVID-19 hotline (801-310-0438). Since it was the weekend, they weren't open, so I left a message and received a call back first thing this morning.

You have to have an appointment to be tested at BYU. When they called me, they gave me several timeframe options during the day. You can either walk up or drive through. Masks are required. I walked since I don't have a car. When I was there this morning, it already seemed pretty busy with a few other people who walked up and 10-15 cars in line waiting to be tested. The whole process took me 5-10 minutes from the time I arrived to the time I left.

There is a tent at the front of the Student Health Center where you give them your name to check in. They took my temperature, and after waiting for a few minutes, one of the doctors administered the test. Yes, it involves sticking a q-tip type thing far up your nose, but at least for me, it wasn't painful and just tickled. They told me I should expect to get a phone call with the test results on Wednesday.

I'd imagine things will only get busier as the semester continues, so it's probably best to be proactive about getting tested even if you start experiencing even the slightest symptoms. I hope everybody stays safe!",g3hsvp9,Very thoughtful of you to share this. Thanks!,19.0,None,g3hut3j,"Yes thanks for the info.

There was also a weird swamp before  7 peaks was built that we used to catch frogs and snakes.  During the winter, deer would come down and sniff through the snow to get at the grass for food.  It was actually a magical childhood.  We would also hike that same mountain and there would be grapes and plums we would pick and make home made jam from them.
This was 1987-1989ish.   But you know, childhood memories as a kid are way different.  Adults I remember being giants are not anymore, lol.

I think it makes sense to leave the matters of eternal importance to Bishops (with keys and callings), let the police handle illegal matters (sexual assault, theft, drug abuse), and keep the more university policy stuff with the HCO (plagiarism, academic dishonesty, etc).

I agree that cheating is bad, but if you think this will stop it you are kidding yourself. There are reddit threads full of advice on how to get away with cheating using proctorio.

It was an upper-level CS class, and I was swamped with school and work and made an incredibly dumb decision on one of my projects.

I understand that I may have some harsh consequences coming up, I am going to meet the professor over Zoom tomorrow. Sorry to post this here, I am just distraught and wanted to ask if any other students at BYU have gone through something like this? What were your experiences? Did you survive (I know it is a silly question, it just feels so earth-shattering right now)?

I have worked so hard  in my undergrad  and it is terrifying to think of what this may do...

&#x200B;

EDIT

So, one of the most stressful times of my life is now over and I honestly feel like a better person for the experience. The professor was incredibly kind and understanding, and assured me that life will go on. I felt guilt and stress about copying code for that project for months, and allowed it to hurt me, and I encourage any others who may be in a tight situation to never copy code/cheat/take the shortcut. Reach out to your professor, they are surprisingly understanding, before you make a bad choice. If, like me, you have already made the choice, try to do the honest thing. You will feel better afterwards.

BYU isn't immune.,44.0,None,g8p0opb,"BYU offers a course on Sociology of Gender (SOC 367) for anyone interested in learning the scientific understanding of gender. The term “gender” means something different in the scientific community than it does in LDS vernacular; here’s how the key terms are defined in the scientific community:
1. Sex: refers to a person’s physical anatomy; their DNA (XX, XY, etc.) and sex organs (penis, vagina, etc.). This is the scientific term that comes closest to the LDS definition of gender. Most people’s biological sex is either male or female, but there are lots of intersex people who don’t fit cleanly into either category.
2. Sexuality: refers to who a person is romantically attracted to. Some possible sexualities are heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, etc.
3. Gender: refers to the roles/expectations that a culture assigns to males vs. females, and how an individual identifies with those roles. Exists on a scale of masculine to feminine, but what is considered masculine or feminine can vary greatly across cultures. When scientists say that gender is “fluid”, it is because different cultures have different understandings of what is masculine or feminine, and a single individual might act in both masculine and feminine ways depending on the context. For example, the same individual might act in stereotypically masculine ways when playing in a soccer match, but act in stereotypically feminine ways when caring for a newborn baby.

This test question from the OP constitutes a “crapstorm” because, no matter which of these three terms we look at, we find more than 2 binary options. When looking at Sex, there are [many possible conditions](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/intersex-spectrum/) where people don’t fit cleanly into either category of male or female. In terms of Sexuality, people are not always romantically attracted to their opposite gender. And in terms of Gender, people don’t always identify with the gender roles/expectations that their society puts on them, not to mention that we all act in both masculine and feminine ways depending on the setting.

It’s just a personal rant that I just want to get off my chest. In no way do I like to point fingers at anybody specific. 

I had a friend recently that was posted on a social media page where they denounced him of not wearing a mask. He just had it off for a couple of minutes to get that dampness off of his face. He wasn’t speaking to anyone, nor did he have malicious intent. I know this because I was there with him. And yet, people on the media treated him as if he was some sort of criminal. I would’ve understood if the person who posted the photo would’ve approached us and gave him a friendly reminder. But we received no such warning. Now, I don’t want to say who is wrong here. My friend, who is not wearing a mask, is at fault, but did he deserve such treatment? I also cannot agree. 

I’m personally not religious. But, I was a little surprised by how some, perhaps only minority, choose to act in these desperate times. Some people put their views and politics first that they forget the vital part. I don’t think most of the students have malicious intent to spread the virus. I just don’t know if pointing fingers at each other and determining who is right or wrong is the correct thing. I was just a little upset to see that some students in a heavily religious school like BYU like to blame or watch other people being accused. I understand that it's frustrating to see others, not 100% complying with the rules, but I also don’t think Jesus Christ would have reacted the way some people are reacting. 

There are just some personal thoughts that I wish to share with the community. I'm completely okay with people sharing different views or even disagreeing.

The Off-Campus Housing Office is experiencing a heavy volume of inquiries concerning the contract release process. We are asking student’s to communicate with their landlord’s or the landlords’ agent(s) concerning release.  The OCHO recognizes that the contract is a legally binding agreement between the landlord and the student.  However, the OCHO strongly encourages landlords and their agents to consider the value of releasing students. 

BYU has encouraged students to consider leaving campus and return home to finish Winter semester through remote coursework. We recognize individual circumstances may not allow this. (See www.byu.edu/coronavirus for more information.) The intent of this announcement was to allow students the option, when feasible, to improve social distance in the community and their living environment, thus slowing the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. 

Please be advised that in the event the community experiences a high volume of infected and sick students, the landlords will be required to follow the direction of state and local health departments.  By agreement, landlords will be required to quarantine and isolate students.  Landlords will need to provide housing to those impacted, which may include providing quarantined housing to affected students who can no longer reside in their own apartments.  The OCHO asks that landlords carefully examine the risks associated with keeping all residents under contract.  The university will not provide solutions to housing dilemmas which may arise in your properties.  You will be responsible, by contract, for meeting the needs of those students under contract. 

The landlord contract states (#18): “Landlord agrees to maintain the facilities in accordance with all applicable federal, state, county, and city laws or ordinances and with the applicable Minimum Specifications for BYU Contracted Off-Campus Housing shown in Section 20 of the Handbook. Landlord agrees to comply with any reasonable requests of the BYU Off-Campus Housing Office relating to the safety or general welfare of tenants, and correct any failures to comply with such laws, ordinances, and specifications in a reasonable time.”

See Section 16/Management Requirements; Section 17/Respond Promptly to Problems; Section 20/The Minimum Specification in the Off-Campus Housing Handbook. (https://och.byu.edu/landlord-resources)

I was in [CEEN 321](https://catalog.byu.edu/engineering/civil-and-environmental-engineering/structural-analysis). For a homework assignment, we had to do [influence line diagrams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_line). My friend and I did ours together. In my haste, I wrote the wrong conditions in the problem set-up, but still solved the problems correctly.

After class, the professor called me into his office and said he suspected me of copying my friend's homework. I denied it, saying we had done the assignment together and I just mistranscribed some information from the book. ""Here's an idea,"" I said, ""why don't you give me a ILD problem now to prove that I'm not just copying?"" He smiled. ""That's exactly what I'm going to do.""

He reached under his desk and handed me a paper with a problem on it. I sat down and solved it in just a few minutes.

He examined it. ""Okay then, never mind. You're free to go.""

The HCO was never involved.

How about you? What's your story?",el6y1tz,"That’s a sign of a good professor, to take the time to make sure you understood the assignment instead of report you straight to the HCO",31.0,SmecherZilnic,el7359t,"It was in a Humanities class and the teacher announced that their automatic text scrubber had found some potential plagiarism in three papers.

Man, I felt red-faced, but I also hadn't plagiarized and felt confident going in. After class she asked me if I copied from somewhere, I told her that I hadn't and that I wouldn't do that, and she looked at me for a long while and said, ""I believe you. We get some false positives some times, no worries."" And that was that. I really liked her as a teacher.",18.0,crashohno,el76cmt,"After the semester for one of my CS classes my professor emailed me and said one of my submissions closely matched another students and asked if I had copied.

apkyv5,I wrote a book about student social life at American colleges. BYU is chapter 20!,63,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/apkyv5/i_wrote_a_book_about_student_social_life_at/,34,2019-02-11 21:01:50+00:00,thestudentsyes,"Hey everyone, this is the first time I've shared anything about my book on the internet, and I'm sharing with the BYU subreddit because you all were the friendliest students when I visited.

When I was 20 years old, I went on a year long road trip around the USA to try to document the ""college experience."" I spent one week each at 23 of the nation's most interesting campuses. At each school, I would find a random student who would agree to host me. I'd sleep on their couch, go with them to class, sit next to them while they studied, and go with them to parties. Each chapter tells the true story of one week in the life of that person.

The BYU chapter has been a favorite chapter for many early readers. A lot of the book focuses on the partying, drinking, and hooking up that happens at most college campuses. But BYU was a completely different experience, and it was my happiest week out of any school.

I personally think that the BYU chapter of this book is one of the best explanations of Mormon culture for outsider readers who don't know much about Mormonism. A lot of my friends who aren't religious have read this chapter and told me they wished they could move to Provo.

You can read the beginning of the chapter here. [https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt](https://www.thestudentsyes.com/byu-excerpt)

If anyone wants to read the full chapter, just PM me. I'd share the full thing here, but Amazon only allows me to put 10% of the book for free on my website.

I'm curious to hear feedback!

After that meeting, I left frustrated because I was essentially hitting a brick wall. I considered writing President Worthen then but decided that it would be fruitless at best. After an incident at the Testing Center, I was rather in a huff and decided to write President Worthen himself. I wrote a respectfully worded email. I wrote, after an introduction:

>I believe that an update to the Dress & Grooming Standards is overdue, and I have the vast majority of BYU students and my own experience in professional settings to back me up. The part that the I and the vast majority of students think should change is the beard ban. The beard rule has been in place for almost 50 years now \[this was a typo, I meant to type ""60""\]. My parents weren't even alive then, and they have multiple grandchildren. Times have changed, and the beard rule has gone from being a symbol of the professionalism and conservatism of BYU to simply embarrassing the school and by association the Church that sponsors it.

I then offered to meet with him to discuss my concerns further and gave him my contact information. Then I waited.

I received this response today:

>I understand your interest in changing the bead rule, but it is not currently a priority issue for the University.   We are focusing our efforts on things such as giving students more opportunities to be involved in research, internships, study abroad and other experiential learning activities; increasing the number of students who can come to BYU, and providing more opportunities in limited enrollment programs.  I would prefer to use the energy we have to advance those and other educational priorities.   
>  
>I wish you well in your educational endeavors.

So there you have it. I honestly didn't even expect President Worthen to respond to my email, and I can respect his response. I still think the beard rule is stupid and only damaging to BYU's reputation, but with other problems the school has I can respect that it's not priority. Hopefully one of these days someone says  ""why do we still have that rule?"" in a meeting and it finally gets changed, but I'm not holding my breath and I don't think there's anything left that anyone can do. It's up to them to act, and it's just not something that they care about right now.

EDIT: some of you might be wondering why I care so much and why I've been willing to put my time and effort into getting the change. I think facial hair greatly improves my sense of masculinity and therefore my personal confidence. It makes me look older, more distinguished, and more mature. In talking with other men I've found that they feel the same. I also love BYU and think that the beard rule is a dark spot on its reputation.",fg5x5ms,"Ok, that’s good that he responded and it was a respectful response...but how much energy does it take to change the rule? I get everything you said about how the higher ups have to be the ones to change the rule but i really don’t understand how it would take that much energy",52.0,None,fg604od,"\>that's not a priority, we're focusing on other things

&#x200B;

It would take what, less than an hour to change the rule? In a meeting at the end they could slap on ""Hey, also who votes to get rid of the beard rule?""",45.0,3nchilada5,fg6hwp5,"I'm no longer at BYU, but I had an idea back then that I'm pretty sure would get administration to change the beard ban. The only thing is that every male student on campus would have to be on board. Imagine if every single guy in campus grew a mustache! All male BYU athletes sporting mustaches. All male BYU students at internships throughout the country. All male BYU student representation at national academic conferences. All male BYU students in performing arts groups (dance, theater, music groups, Young Ambassadors, etc). And imagine at home football games when the camera pans over the crowd... And every male has a moustache. It would get weird and embarrassing for the school really quick. I bet it would be effective, the issue is just getting everyone on board and organized.",18.0,dmc5

jqodey,Does the Honor Code Office Stand in Need of Further Revision?,57,https://www.reddit.com/r/byu/comments/jqodey/does_the_honor_code_office_stand_in_need_of/,11,2020-11-09 01:43:21+00:00,Competitive_Tea_4098,"I'm sorry for making a post about the honor code, but it's been on my mind a lot recently, and I'm curious to hear what everyone's current opinions are regarding the Honor Code Office. It was such a hot topic of debate before COVID and I feel like a lot of issues never were resolved.

Personally, I have mixed opinions about the HCO.

First off, I love BYU's honor code and think it's awesome that the university encourages its students to live at such a high standard. The honor code sets BYU apart from other universities and creates a tame environment for LDS students seeking to be educated and spiritually uplifted.

The problem with the HCO, however, occurs when a student slips up. Unlike the gospel, which teaches that no one is perfect and repentance is possible, the Honor Code Office expects its students to be perfect. The HCO is unforgiving, and one mistake can lead to huge negative consequences in that student's education.

**In this, the Honor Code Office basically incentivizes its students to procrastinate repentance.** Even though a student may have the desire to repent of their mistakes, they might wait to do so until graduation out of fear of being suspended or expelled from school. There are other options, such as taking a year off of school and transferring schools, but these are pretty huge decisions that can be avoided if the student chooses to just stay quiet.

Now, of course, before attending the university, all BYU students are required to sign the honor code. I honestly believe that the majority of these students attend with the intention of abiding by that code as well. The reality of the situation is, however, that NO ONE is perfect. No matter how good their intentions, people are bound to slip up because we are human. I'm not saying that the HCO should allow for students to completely disregard the Honor Code. I am arguing, however, that the HCO should follow the example of our Savior and be forgiving towards the students who seek repentance and change. If a student breaks the honor code and begins taking the steps necessary to repent, I think that he/she should be allowed to continue attending the university.

**The Honor Code Office is great, but it could stand to be more forgiving towards its imperfect students.**

Anyways, those are my thoughts on the subject, but I am curious to see what everyone else thinks of BYU's current Honor Code Office policies?",gboe099,I think an additional problem with the honor code is that the students don’t feel like they can change anything in it. (The honor code was originally made by students.)since they have no part in what it consists of they don’t feel responsible for living up to it. If byu offered to let the students decide what was in the honor code I dont think much would change other than the dress and grooming standards.,48.0,Nova_Maverick,gboj0rk,">Even though a student may have the desire to repent of their mistakes, they might wait to do so until graduation out of fear of being suspended or expelled from school.

This is the key part I would like pushed. If BYU expects to have students act perfectly, they are delusional. I'm sure there are people that have violated WoW or LoC, but are still in a better spot spiritually than others who lie, disrespect, and don't attend Church. Examining one's state only according to the adherence of one rule/commandment doesn't paint the whole picture. The HCO doesn't see it that way, though.",15.0,redsyrinx2112,gbouevf,"I don’t have the stats on cases at the HCO, but I’ll tell you that in my firsthand experience, they allowed me to fix mistakes first. I was given lots of opportunity to resolve issues. This was back in ‘05-ish. Because of the unknown outcome that I was facing, the initial fear was certainly there, but once it was all out in the open, expulsion or suspension were not the first thing they jumped to.

I did; however, continue to slip up and even was excommunicated after completing my graduation requirements, but before officially graduating. They didn’t know about that and I might be one of very few, if not the only, excommunicated person to graduate BYU.",9.0,Brakethecycle

What was shocking was the number of people in that class who didn't know anything about family finance. A lot of them didn't understand 401k's, compound interest, mortgages, or taxes. In my experience, a shocking number of people don't know the first thing about personal finance.

I have exhausted all of the people in my ward, classes, and so on, and I don't know how to meet any new people.

If you are also introverted and are struggling with making friends, shoot me a message if you're interested in meeting up. Hopefully we can help each other out !

Lots of us are in the same boat and maybe just haven’t had the chance/courage to post and ask about it. I would really suggest that you head out and find activities that you like apart from the normal ward activities and events. There are a bunch of things in Provo such as Art Strolls, open mic nights, summer concerts, arcades, bowling that you can go to and meet some people. Maybe find people in your classes and you meet on campus that have similar interests. 
You could also try joining a club at BYU that you might be interested in.

My best suggestion is to start a weekly social event of some kind. Something that interests you. Basketball watch parties, D&D nights, a book club, woodworking class, rock climbing. It might be hard to get started, but if you can get a group together through message boards, ward, etc. you'll end up putting together a group of friends that you might stick with for a decade or more after graduation.",6.0,BornBitter,fj2xunh,"I think the other comments in here give good ideas, but if you're anything like the type of introvert I am, you'll despise idea of forming/joining a club or group even if you're interested in the topic.

&#x200B;

When I first got to BYU at the beginning of last winter semester, I also often felt extremely lonely, because, yes, it seems the majority of people here are extroverted and super energetic or bubbly. And goodness I am not. I live in Heritage Halls, now, and have 5 roommates, which I thought I would hate, but I really like having them. It has really detracted from the loneliness. While I have gotten more used to the remaining loneliness, sometimes it does feel like it will crush me. I keep trucking though lmao.

* Classes are canceled on the 13th, 16th, and 17th.  After this, classes will resume using some for of remote instructions (online).  This is being left to professors to handle. 
* The testing center will stay open until all tests currently open are finished (which will happen by Wednesday).  After this, the center will remain closed until further notice. Only 100 people will be allowed to take tests at a time. They are encouraging students to take tests ASAP to avoid massive waits. 
* BYU is encouraging students to travel home.  Not like back to your apartment, but like actual home.  They recognize that this will be hard/impossible for lots of people. 
* Campus will stay open during all of this 
* We DON'T know exactly how this will affect on-campus jobs.  BYU has left this up to the discretion of supervisors etc... We have some people in the comments saying that their boss has already told them they will all still be working, but everything seems to be case by case.  Obviously (hopefully) if you are sick, don't go to work.
* Graduation is cancelled. So are concerts, devotionals, athletic events, etc... Basically anything with a large gathering.
* Not only are athletic events on BYU canceled, all NCAA events are canceled ( [https://twitter.com/NCAA/status/1238197201928667136](https://twitter.com/NCAA/status/1238197201928667136) )
* Zoom ([zoom.byu.edu](https://zoom.byu.edu)) is available to all BYU students/employees for online group meetings if you need to talk to your team project etc...
* I've heard from people living on campus housing that they are letting them out of contacts and refunding rent based on when they leave.
