You're one of us, but with great power comes great responsibility. I'm not talking academic responsibility, but properly respecting the Harvard name. We're a special breed. People are out to get us, and it's the job of all of us to maintain the prestige behind the name.

You've probably already ordered your Harvard, Champion brand hoodie from the Coop. You made a good choice, it's the best hoodie. But the next time you're at Chipotle and wearing it alongside your friends going to Brown, Cornell, or worse, *Yale,* do you know how to properly address the fact that yes, you do in fact go to Harvard?

Here's a little guide of the time tested responses to the typical situations Harvard students may find themselves in having to discreetly explain that you're better than whomever you may be speaking to.

**Ordering at Starbucks:** If you're getting a hot drink, make sure you ask for one of the red holiday cups. If they ask why, just a simple ""I'm a Harvard student"" will do the trick. They may give you a funny look, but it's jealousy, don't worry about it. Persist until you get your red cup, you wouldn't want to be seen with a green cup and have people think you go to Dartmouth.

**Talking to a parent's friend:** Your parents are going to brag about you. Get used to it, it's the rest of your life. You need to lean to embrace it. Play the offence. Ask them where their children are going to college, such that you have the upper hand in saying ""I'm attending Harvard in the fall."" You don't want to be cornered. You'll receive an array of responses. ""That's very impressive, your parents must be so proud!"" Tell the truth, don't beat around the bush. ""It is, and they are"" is the only proper response. Veritas means truth, after all.

**On a date:** This one is tricky. Being self confident is important. It's good to let them know in the first few minutes, primarily to quickly figure out if they're a Yalie. The easiest option is to buy Harvard socks, and as soon as you meet, go down to tie your shoe. Your pant leg will rise, and their eyes will be drawn to your socks. It's discrete, but a good power move.

**Being asked about college but you're unsure how to mention you go to Harvard:** This one takes work. People can sense the Harvard on you, but they'll often ask for confirmation. The easiest option is to say ""I'm a student at the college."" Don't mention Harvard at first. This is to establish that once they ask ""which college?"" it's implied that they should have assumed Harvard. If they ask what you're studying, philosophy is the best answer. They're expecting finance, but philosophy will help further establish your intellectual dominance over them. Also, remember, it's **concentration**, not major.

**Talking to your friends:** Your friends already know you're superior to them, but a bit of consoling for their admittance to Bowdoin or Wesleyan won't kill you. ""That program there is great"" is a good response to their concerns. Don't mention the discrepancy in endowment size, unless reassuring them that no college really needs more than 2bn anyway (make sure your fingers are crossed behind your back, just to be safe). If you're missing them, make sure you go visit them. You don't want them seeing how much better you have it, and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.

I'm sure you've all updated your Facebook/Instagram/Tinders already, but make sure to do so now if you're yet to. You're going to have a great two years here before you start your business and drop out, make sure to make the most of them. Remember, don't be downwind of John when you and your friends go to pee on him, and, most importantly, YUCK FALE!",ebtdxf3,Come to Cornell,206.0,The_Poseidolon,ebru9eq,"> *and besides, it gives you more opportunities to tell their friends where you go to school.* 

fuck lmao",111.0,harverdreject,ebs8r35,"Also important to follow the ""Harvard time"" rule. When speaking to any person that you aren't certain is aware that you are a Harvard student, make sure that you mention it within 7 minutes of meeting them. 
Sometimes this can be tough because people want to talk about things that aren't relevant to your announcement. Getting a Harvard phone case and setting a 7 minute timer is key, if it hasn't come up within the first 6 mins, go ahead and pull up your phone so they can see it and Google whatever subject they are talking about and Harvard, there will usually be something that pops up and work that into the conversation quickly.",95.0,Nickbarc

""But HarvardDating, how will I flex as hard digitally as I do on campus?"" It's a troubling question. Through the eyes of a webcam your classmates won't know you're wearing Yeezys, and won't be able to see you carry your Boosted Board into class. It's a troubling issue, now you'll be restricted to the small view your webcam allows in order to show everyone how much better than them you are. Luckily, there are some solutions for this conundrum that will allow you to continue to flex in your virtual classes.

* Headphones

Since people will only be able to see your upper body, headphones are the obvious go-to. Your Bose or Sony's won't cut it anymore, you need something that displays your true status. My recommendation is the [Sennheiser Orpheus.](https://en-us.sennheiser.com/sennheiser-he-1) Coming in at just shy of $60,000 they serve as a good starting point for displaying your wealth and status. The disadvantage is that you won't be able to claim you missed hearing something in class, forcing you to actually pay attention for once, but it's a small price to pay for the amount of drip they come with.

* Your background

The concrete walls of your parent's basement where they're quarantining you until all your filthy Boston germs are gone isn't sufficient. Hopefully you've beat the rush and already reserved the [AirBnB penthouse in Manhattan](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33279205?location=Manhattan%2C%20New%20York%2C%20NY&adults=1&check_in=2020-04-22&check_out=2020-04-30&source_impression_id=p3_1583846555_GQPQOEZl0kOpVvF4) you're staying at until your summer internship starts. Robot concierge included to prevent infection. Sitting by the window for your classes here reminds everyone that it's worth paying over $1,000 per night for the luxury of not having to be around the sickly. A way to increase your flex is to step away from class halfway through to grab the Peking duck you ordered from Seamless for lunch. Just make sure the driver leaves it at the door so you don't have to see them, let alone talk to them.

* Jewelry

Since your neck will be in view, it's only logical that you show off some ice. This [diamond-studded white gold Cuban chain](https://www.avianneandco.com/collections/diamond-cuban-chain/products/14k-solid-white-gold-mens-diamond-cuban-chain-20-00-ctw) will glisten in the light that comes in through the windows of your penthouse, overexposing your webcam with light so that your classmates will have no choice but to notice it. A bonus is getting a custom Harvard piece commemorating the occasion, which shouldn't take too long to produce if you already have a jeweler on retainer.

There are many other subtle ways to remind your classmates of your superiority during this transition to virtual classes, but I hope this serves as a good starting point for those of you unsure of where to start due to the sudden shift to distance education. **Most importantly,** make sure to remind any Extension students you might come into contact with that your virtual classes are more legitimate and educational than theirs. They should know this already, but a gentle reminder never hurts.

bxkn2t,Rising Senior: I got rejected from every internship I applied to.,107,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/bxkn2t/rising_senior_i_got_rejected_from_every/,24,2019-06-06 19:09:21+00:00,thedietitian,"With the onslaught of celebratory grad school, commencement, and internship posts on Facebook, I thought I would throw a glitch in the matrix and share my story: I was rejected from every summer internship that I applied to. It's the (supposedly) all-important junior summer, and I have nothing to do. But to be honest, I'm kind of okay with it. 

I think rejection stories are extremely important to share. I don't think we hear about them at Harvard as much as we should, but there's beauty in vulnerability. I started applying to summer internships several months ago. I even made it to the third round of interviews at my dream internship, and the company didn't even have the courtesy to let me know I was rejected. I had to ask them. After the onslaught of rejection letters sent to my inbox, I even began applying to random, mostly unpaid internships I found on Indeed, and I didn't get those either. I even applied to sell books at Barnes & Noble and I didn't get that too! And that was supposed to be Plan C.

But I want people to know that it's okay to get rejected. It totally happens. Rejection is not a reflection of your qualifications and self-worth. I do believe there's beauty in doing nothing, and I'm going to spend the summer entertaining myself and achieving my personal goals. I have every intention of sitting on my behind and watching 19+ seasons of Million Dollar Listing. I also want to get in shape and finally read the books on my bucket list that I haven't been able to because of schoolwork. Every time you get rejected from something, you can focus on something that you chose to do and what's truly meaningful to you. I like to think of it this way: I don't have to slave over a task delegated to me by a superior. This summer, I'm charting my own path.

My family is pretty upset about all the nothing I'm doing, and I'm not really sure how to address that. They have high expectations. But I have to say, I'm semi-happy with how my summer is going. Sure, it's cool that my peers are doing internships at Facebook, Google, and L'Or√©al. But I also think it's really important to cast rejection in a positive light. You own the time that you've been given. You're free to define the hours as you see fit. I hate waking up at the crack of dawn, and now I can spend my time sleeping until the early afternoon. I hate commuting, and I've gained back three hours of time I would've spent commuting roundtrip. 

I don't really know how to conclude this post, but I just wanted to share that rejection happens to Harvard students and it's totally okay: cast that rejection in a positive light.",eq8tzg8,"If you‚Äôre in NYC, I‚Äôll try to get you an internship with an educational nonprofit.

ija9di,It's worth revisiting the Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017...,89,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/ija9di/its_worth_revisiting_the_harvard_meme_scandal_of/,24,2020-08-30 09:47:10+00:00,throwawayharvard2021,"Hello. Throwaway here.

I'm sure many of you remember the [Harvard Meme Scandal of 2017](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/6/5/2021-offers-rescinded-memes/). Either the rescinded students came years after you, they were your potential classmates, or they served as a warning to use social media wisely when it came time for you to apply to college.

Fast forward to today. I, like many other folks on this thread, receive a smattering of strange Facebook messages from people all around the world. Last night, I was going through my  message requests and somehow ended up in the ""hidden messages"" tab (new Facebook is a pain). There, behold, lay all of the chats I had ever joined and then left, including ""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"". I, like many of you, had joined this chat back when it was named something else, and was innocent and silly. As soon I realized the chat had turned dark and offensive, I left it immediately. However, because I don't live on Facebook, this was at least several hours after the most egregious content began flowing in. (""Harvard memes for horny bourgeois teens"" was a precursor group chat for an ""edgy"" meme chat. If you wanted to join the ""edgy"" chat, you had to post something suitably offensive in ""horny bourgeois teens"", and the people in the ""edgy"" chat would let you in. Obviously I never posted anything myself and I never joined the ""edgy"" chat, but there was plenty of horrible content  in ""horny bourgeois teens"" alone, and this chat was likely what was reported to admissions.) I had no idea I still had access to these messages, three years after leaving the chat, so I began to look at them.

Here's where it gets interesting. By briefly looking at the Facebook profiles of students who sent the offensive memes (assuming they are among the students who were ultimately rescinded), I learned that they were now mostly rising juniors at schools including Stanford, Brown, UC Berkeley, Washington University at St. Louis, and Carnegie Mellon. Obviously, these are some of the top schools in our nation. I had many thoughts upon seeing that, although these students had their admission withdrawn from Harvard for posting (and making) memes that were racist, sexist, anti-Semitic, etc., they were seemingly able to move onto equally prestigious schools with no penalties, apart from having to wait until the next admissions cycle to apply.  When I looked at the website of one rescinded student, he claimed he took a gap year to work on an extracurricular project (I'm being vague here). Additionally, and honestly most critically, at least one (white) student who had sent an offensive racial meme appears to be a current student at Harvard (in my class)!

Of course, the Harvard scandal was in 2017. In the years since (and in the past couple months alone) many other students have faced similar consequences for their social media posts. Just a few days ago, the past caught up with this doctor who lied about the reason she was forced to [leave her first residency program](https://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/2020/08/former-cleveland-clinic-residents-training-certificate-revoked-over-anti-semitic-social-media-comments.html). She was dismissed because she made anti-Semitic tweets, but she didn't tell the second residency program that. Of course, when it inevitably found out, the second program kicked her out and she has now lost her medical license. The circumstances surrounding her case are different (her tweets were public, and directly related to medical care) but arguably relevant to the Harvard situation.

For a disclaimer: I have no interest in doxxing or exposing these students (I will just say, after some Googling, that there is some potential tea here). I simply thought that it would be interesting to have a conversation about what happened, three years later, and discuss what moving on from such a mistake, if you will call it that, should look like. Should students have to tell other colleges if they were rescinded from another college, like they must report disciplinary incidents or acts of academic dishonesty from high school?

I'll add that the MO of more recent ""doxxers"" appears to be exposing students publicly. See [these cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/us/racism-social-media-college-admissions.html) for example, in which the students' names were published in multiple news outlets. However, the identities of the rescinded Harvard students have, to my knowledge, never been exposed or released in any manner (one student gave a NPR interview about the scandal using his first name only). So while a student rescinded from college in 2020 due to a racist meme is likely going to have his or name plastered all over the Internet, this did not happen to any of these students.

I'm curious to hear what members of this community think.",g3czy0a,"I know who three of those people are, but I was never in that group. I was in another group though and I remember just watching the drama unfold and asking myself how those idiots got into Harvard in the first place. It was a really big deal at the time and I know a few people deactivated their social media accounts for a while, I'm assuming because they probably had posted offensive things when they were younger and they didn't want that coming back to bite them in the tush. 

With all of that being said, I'm not upset that they get to pursue higher education at top universities without the world knowing what they did. Today's cancel culture is brutal and everything is set in stone, or on Twitter. No matter how much a person apologizes and how hard they commit to changing themselves, very few people will see it as genuine and their name will forever be tied to something moronic they said online. Although change and education should be something you do for yourself, not for the sake of restoring your reputation, clearing your name is still important for any future endeavors. Harvard was absolutely right to cut ties with them, I supported that decision back then and I support it now, just like I support the anonymity of those involved. 

Don't get me wrong, being 17 doesn't excuse their behavior, especially in today's world. But I think it's okay that they got to move on, all we can do now is hope that being told to fuck off by Harvard was a learning experience. I know some people were upset that they ""got away without consequences"", but I'd argue that being set back for a whole year and not being able to attend the university you really wanted to attend is an appropriate consequence for their action of creating offensive memes.",40.0,pinkstardust007,g3cxpxz,[deleted],20.0,None,i14knut,"just heard this today:

Is this an issue always at Harvard? Yes. But it's a bit less tolerable due to Covid-19.

I know, this may sound rude to Cambridge residents and visitors - but I'm a student. I have four classes. And my WiFi where I live is **awful**. I walk to campus every day or so because it's the nearest place that I can walk that has WiFi and a great place to social distance. The Harvard WiFi is God-tier power.

Plus, for students like me - being on campus helps me 'get out' and feel like life is 'normal' somewhat again. But seriously, the WiFi.

However, the locals, tourists and people with their (screaming) children are making it harder and harder to be here and keep a distance.

Whereas before the virus you might have had a weekly homework/problem set/ reading assignment, now 4 of my 5 classes assign work to be done throughout the week, it's not more difficult to do, but just more difficult to organize. 

For example, I'm taking one course right now that assigns weekly readings, normal right? Nope, with the pandemic, we're expected to make comments on reading by Saturday night, respond to our peers' comments by Sunday night and do like 3 separate video responses. That x4 has already led to me missing some deadlines (profs seem to be understanding at least) and even some sleep deprivation. Is anyone else feeling this?",g4lq7y1,I totally feel this.

That classes as HES are not like that in my opinion. With the exception of one class, all my classes followed a normal schedule of weekly meetings, papers, Zoom session, breakout groups, etc.

I think the type of online education you are describing would frustrate me to no end. While the online technology environment has transferred from HES, I think some teaching lessons and methods have not. TBH, it has got to be hard on instructors & TF's making the shift online also.

Hang in there, and provide honest feedback. As the greenhorn-to-online-learning profs get some experience, and embrace constructive criticism, it will get better.

Some facts:

&#x200B;

(1) Fact: Asian-Americans do get admitted at [significantly lower](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/images/print-edition/20180623_USC932_0.png) rate than other minorities. Neither side disagrees on this.

&#x200B;

(2) Fact: Both sides used the same data sets to achieve their separate conclusions (led by Prof. Card for the defense and Prof.  Arcidiacono for the plaintiffs.) More on this later.

&#x200B;

(3) Fact: Asian-Americans get lower personality scores (specifically ""likability"" ratings) by admission officers who have not met them but know their race.

&#x200B;

(4) Fact: The only area. Only area- that Asian-Americans trail any other race is on the personality section. Thus if asian americans are not discriminated against, they must have worse personalities. But Harvard has both denied that asians are discriminated against or that they have worse personalities. Harvard has given NO explanation for why asians are admitted at lower rates.

&#x200B;

(5) Fact: Supreme court precedent, and the fate of nearly $600 million/year in federal funds to Harvard, prevents Harvard from admitting to race quotas. Yet, the % composition of asians (as well as other races), each year, has remained remarkably constant for over a decade. A statistical anomaly.

&#x200B;

(6) Fact: Using the same data sets, only the plaintiffs have adjusted for the effect of legacies, athletes, and other preferential admissions.  Meaning, asians are not admitted at lower rates because they are less likely be to legacies or athletes.

&#x200B;

The most important is #6 as that is an incorrect explanation seen around here a lot.

hu0m2g,Did I make a mistake choosing Harvard?,81,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/hu0m2g/did_i_make_a_mistake_choosing_harvard/,30,2020-07-19 13:37:49+00:00,bigbluebottle123,"Two years ago. I applied early action, never expected to get in, but when I did, I then immediately accepted my offer - because it's Harvard. I didn't really care about college environment or campus life because I believed most of it was pretty bs. I was going to be in a city and in the best college in the world. I could make my own life great at Harvard. I would make a ton of friends, go out, have fun, typical college life.

Fast forward two years later and I can't help but laugh at myself. These past two years at Harvard have been so awful. 3.7 GPA which is ok but not great enough right now, terrible dorm situation freshman year where there was literally no community b/c I lived in Wigg and my suitemates and I just did not vibe, failed a comp (twice) that consumed my life and as a result ruined my grades and opportunities to socialize or meet people or join more inclusive clubs freshman year, a toxic blocking group that just fell apart, and one big hunk of depression and an ocean of suicide thoughts. 

I see everyone I know at Yale loving college and wanting to go back to school. On the other hand, all of my friends at Harvard say the same thing ""I should have gone to Yale. They're happy."" ""I hate Harvard."" We all chose Harvard because of the clout, and in the end got handed literally no dorm or ""house"" community, an incredibly exclusive and toxic social culture, and ridiculous semester-long comp processes just to join a fucking club. It's like Harvard has to put barriers for everything and make everything so hard to get. Seeing other students at Yale, Princeton, Stanford be way happier and be at just as good of a school is really disappointing. A big part of me regrets choosing Harvard and wish I had applied to other schools and really researched their campus life instead of just jumping the gun as soon as I got into Harvard early action. Maybe I'm desperate to not be completely miserable, but can someone give me a reason as to why Harvard is the right choice over these other schools? About what makes Harvard actually better despite the fact that my life here was so miserable?",fyk4d5b,"a 3.7 GPA is very good. College is what you make of it, and if you aren't vibing at H you probably wouldn't have vibed at other places. The illusion of college being some kind of ""golden years"" period is bullshit. 

We have 2 loci of control; internal (themselves) and external (environment). People have a tendency to blame bad things on external loci and give credit to good things with internal loci. Flip the narrative. If you're having buyers remorse, get over it. You go to Harvard. Understand the level of privilege that gives you. 

Also, life tends to suck in general, so, figure it out and instead of complaining, refocus on what's working and deserves more attention to make those things work even better.",95.0,None,fyk4k6u,"Sophomore year is by far the hardest year.  Keep on trucking and you will see that the people get nicer as the finish line gets closer...and that finals clubs are overrated.  

Of course now there is COVID, too.  Good luck and don‚Äôt give up.  

-Brian (‚Äò02)",51.0,skypetutor,fykbvvs,"Going to pile on the comments that a 3.7 GPA is pretty fantastic. I scraped a 3.3 in ec and life is good a few years out.

Not sure what organizations you comped, but my observation was that those are extremely difficult to pass as a frosh or even sophomore.

Lastly, I can guarantee that *elis* are the last people you should be jealous of. Same pressure cooker environment, just in another state (and a way shittier campus). If you‚Äôre really thinking that Harvard isn‚Äôt the right place to be, maybe it‚Äôs not, but I can guarantee that the situation is not wildly better in new haven. Use covid to take stock; maybe you would feel better at another school. It‚Äôs not unheard of.

Kashuv says he's being proactive by emailing the office of diversity about his actions, but why was he not proactive with acknowledging and rectifying his offensive comments *before* they were made public and broadcasted on media? He is only ""remorseful"" because he got caught with these messages coming to light. This is not about politics. There are plenty of conservative, pro-gun students enrolled at Harvard. This is about rescinding a student who said some truly racist, hateful things. The last time Harvard rescinded admissions it was about those kids posting offensive memes. This case seems much the same. His excuse that he was  just 16, immature, and never-intending to do harm is laughable. No one cares about your intentions - the effects, outcomes, and perception of your actions are what matter.

&#x200B;

He also criticizes Harvard for not recognizing that someone can ""grow and learn from their actions."" Nowhere did Harvard say that it doesn't believe in a person's capacity to grow.

I fully support the decision to rescind this admission. The applicant said he wanted to kill jews, for goodness sake. That's not a slip of the tongue.

cmztpo,Looking to speed run the three traditions?,80,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/cmztpo/looking_to_speed_run_the_three_traditions/,4,2019-08-07 02:16:02+00:00,HarvardDating,"While students at other institutions may spend their time thinking about their grades, future careers, or their LinkedIn, Harvard students have a unique set of problems they face: **How to complete the three traditions as quickly as possible.**


No, going as a Yalie for your first Halloween in Cambridge isn't a tradition, but looking around you'll be led to believe it is. The three traditions I'm talking about, of course, are having sex in the stacks, peeing on John Harvard, and participating in the Primal Scream. While STEM concentrations may think they're too busy to do any of this, or that people couldn't *actually* be having sex in Widener, us social science concentrations are well aware of the social pressures put onto every student here to partake in these traditions prior to graduating.

If you're determined, any dedicated Harvard student can complete the trifecta of traditions in less than 10 minutes. Luckily, since typically [65% of the matriculating class are virgins,](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/09/harvards-class-2017-full-virgins-and-thats-okay/311342/) none of you should have any problem completing **step one: having sex in the stacks** in a matter of minutes. The hardest part of this is agreeing on which section to practice procreation in. While Greek Philosophy is a popular one, I typically choose the *Love Languages* section, just to set the mood a bit.

Once you've completed the first task and left Widener, you should have about 7 minutes left, which is more than enough time to get over to the John Harvard statue. This step is arguably the most important, as **step two: peeing on John Harvard** doesn't only serve to complete the tradition, but is an important measure to take in order to prevent UTIs. Depending on the equipment of your partner you may have to give them a lift, or help each other up, but synchronizing streams, while not necessary, is certainly preferred.

Conveniently, this act can be used to kill two birds with one stone, and **step three: the Primal Scream** is generally an involuntary reaction to the burning sensation you feel while peeing on John after having sex with a stranger in the stacks. Be sure to make it a good one, this is your moment. Everyone's eyes are on you, people are leaning out of Thayer to cheer you on, and they want to hear a walloping, unadulterated scream. Similar to step two, this is a good opportunity to team up with your partner and harmonize a bit. Give the Krokodiloes a run for their money.

After dismounting from the statue, you should have just under a minute left, which is just enough time for the two of you to decide which of you is running to the HEM, and which to Malkin, for you both to shower the shame off. Shake dry hands, congratulate each other, and begin sprinting your separate ways into the night.",ew5udz3,"Assuming that we‚Äôre all capable of finding a sexual partner is blatant discrimination against STEM students, smh.

In truth, MAT 157 is the most difficult of such courses, delving into topics generally not covered by even the most experienced of Real Analysts. 

&#x200B;

In the first week, we cover Horseshoe Analysis, showing that even the most insane integrals can be shown to be true with a simple symbological statement. Horseshoe functions are integrable in real space. Currently, we are exploring applications of Horseshoe Induction in the Riemann Hypothesis over finite vector ring spaces. Our class, which began with 250 people, currently hosts 25 attendees, 10 of which who are currently viewing the material from the local psych ward. Over the weekend, we had the pleasure of proving the Cognitive Theoretic Model of the Universe (CTMU) over finite fields in real space. The only prerequisite of this course is High School Calculus, with recommended courses in Latin and Greek Philosophy. All students are required to attend seminars ranging from 5 hours to 11 hours a day in which students discuss Richard and Mortimer and the metaphysical implications of the topics discussed.

I haven't seen many reviews  online and thought it would be good for anyone considering the program to learn about my experiences before they get involved. Of course this is my opinion and others may disagree.

The Technology, Innovation and Education program is a one year master of education degree that overall specializes in the application of technology into education. You are required to take 5 classes that fulfill TIE credits and can use the remaining credits anywhere on campus or via cross registration at other schools. The TIE credit classes at the School of Education are meant to be applicable to many different careers whether they be designing educational programs, developing new education products, starting a business in education, bringing more technology into the classroom etc. You can find most of this information online and I wanted to share some of the pros and cons of the program here.

Pros:

1. Hands down the best part of the program is the cohort of other students you work with. Our cohort was about 70 people who represented lots of different backgrounds. Off the top of my head there were successful entrepreneurs, classroom teachers, programmers, business consultants, political activists, project managers, medical professionals and more. There were not a lot of people straight out of undergrad and the majority had some kind of education related experience. All of them were very inspiring, really personable and I felt really honored to be with them.
2. Being on the Harvard campus is incredible. You are open to just about everything going on at all the schools on campus and I felt it was really easy to meet people across many different programs through extracurriculars and other activities. MIT and Tufts are open to you as well if you feel like heading to another campus! Lots of competitions, classes, talks, meet ups, sporting events and that's not even considering the other things Boston offers.
3. The faculty are great. I really liked my adviser and the professors at HGSE. Across the other campus schools people are really responsive to meet as well. So long as you're a student on campus you have access to just about anyone.

Cons

1. One year is really, really short. If you are looking to enter the education industry but are not sure of the kind of role you are looking for your job search at the end might be difficult. Two semesters really isn't long enough to develop a solid set of new skills or to try out a lot of new things in the process. If you have a very clear vision (i.e. I want to start a company or I want to transition to a project manager in education) you will absolutely have the resources available to at least learn enough to secure an entry level role somewhere perhaps with the help of an adviser or professor. The classes alone aren't a feeder into any particular role and you will need to guide all of this yourself. In my opinion, the classes weren't particularly rigorous especially when compared with the core curriculum at some of the other graduate schools.
2. The career service office is completely overloaded and are not a lot of help. I don't know of anyone that took a job from the internal job board and the coaching sessions there are limited to 20 minutes at a time. The job fairs/employment seminars were honestly a little disappointing as some of the more well known education players either weren't present, weren't hiring at the event or clearly weren't serous about recruiting there (the scholastic people didn't even bring paper to write down interested candidates information!). Also the bigger companies that visited campus such as Microsoft made clear that they would not be accepting resumes and were only there to share their experiences in education. There are career resources present at HGSE through unofficial channels like advisers, colleagues, seminars and professors but don't expect the school itself to present many opportunities.
3. Alumni support is not as good as other graduate schools on campus. You can join the Harvard alumni network however there isn't really much in terms of alumni meet ups/reunions that the other graduate schools on campus have. 
4. As everyone already know the price tag is steep. Living in Boston is much more expensive than it used to be as well.

My Recommendations

I think this program is best suited for the following kinds of people:

1. You can get some kind of scholarship and get a leg up in classroom teaching opportunities. I personally don't think that the price of the program justifies the amount of ""leg up"" you get in teaching.
2. You are serious about starting a business in education and want to make use of all the entrepreneurship resources there.
3. Your company/school/organization will pay for this somehow or you will work in your original employer with some sort of bonus at the end of the program. 9 months is possible for some employers to work with and you can do the program part time over 2 years however I don't think there are many spots available for this.
4. You have a very defined transition into another career. Your first semester will be spent figuring out life at Harvard and your second semester will be all about finding a job. There is not a lot of time to test things out and see what you like. This is quite similar to other students I spoke to at MIT and the Kennedy school doing one year programs as you really don't have enough time to experience things like at 4 years of undergrad. Decide what you want to do in October at the latest and get as many skills and contacts in that industry/company as possible.
5. You already have a core skill i.e. programming, data analysis, financial modeling, graphic design etc. and want to transition into education. You can gain credibility in education within two semesters but don't have the time to master a ""hard skill."" The technology classes there coupled with a lot of outside resources can help but it will be a very busy year for you and will sacrifice a lot of the ""Harvard experience"" to do this. The motto on campus is that your fifth class every semester is ""Harvard"" due to the amount of activity on campus throughout the year.
6. The students who found work afterwards were typically doing roles such as curriculum designer, learning designer, community partnerships manager, non profit coordinators, education researchers and teachers. A few people went back to their original jobs in some form and a quite a few others are still looking for work a few months after graduation. 

Ultimately the consensus I've seen from alumni and colleagues is that it is a really enjoyable experience but may not be the most effective use of time and money unless you fit the above categories. Like many other roles in this day and age if you are really passionate about entering a certain profession there are many other ways of doing it rather than getting another degree.

8re2ay,Harvard records show discrimination against Asian-Americans: group | Reuters,48,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-harvard-discrimination/harvard-records-show-discrimination-against-asian-americans-group-idUSKBN1JB1UF,38,2018-06-15 20:23:10+00:00,None,,e0rft8z,"The alumni who interviewed the Asian applicants say that their personality are the same as other races, but the actual admissions folks who DIDN'T interview the Asian applicants still gave them a lower personality score? Lol, wut?",51.0,PurpleCopper,e0r8wn4,"If Harvard's defense is that Asian applicants rank lower on personality traits and this is the root cause of a lower than otherwise expected admissions rate, and the plaintiffs choose to meet them head on regarding this point, which it seems they want to do, then the burden of proof is on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that Asian applicants as a group are objectively not weaker in this category. 

Based on an inexperienced reading of their filing (IANAL) it does not appear that they have done this. Rather instead, they have demonstrated that Asian applicants receive lower scores in this area, (using some definitely janky non-standard mathematics, but Harvard does not really dispute it) and then imply that because these ratings are subjective, they must be lower as a result of discrimination. They dismiss out of hand Harvard's witness's contention that Asian applicants are actually weaker in this category, calling it, ""offensive racial sterotyping... legally and factually untenable."" Stereotyping or not, they have to prove it to be false, and that's actually really really hard to do. 

Quotes from leadership who are not directly involved in admissions are not weighty, and it is not hard to think of explanations for why admissions-office ratings can differ from alumni-interviewer ratings. Instead, the plaintiffs try to push the burden of proof onto the defendant, asking Harvard's witness to present a non-race explanation for the lower personality trait scores. While his refusal to do so constitutes a weak defense, it is still plausibly coherent, and the plaintiffs must pierce it themselves. If they are unable to do so, then I'm not sure they have much of a case. 

***

Sideways from the legal stuff, it is clear that Harvard has a system that they implement that consistently produces the student body that they desire. The plaintiffs believe that the process should be different, resulting in a different student body composition. Who gets to make that kind of decision, and how much control should the government have over it? These are some really interesting questions that are going to get answered as all of this plays out. ",27.0,mileylols,e0tlbyt,"So I'm one of those Asians with a  perfect sat score, high class rank + national level competitions/ extracurriculars in math and the social sciences, that likely got rejected due to  the caps 10 years ago. Also I didn't realize it until college but my family was dirt poor compared to my peers (waiter + post-doc salary).  


Ultimately all the Ivies rejected me but luckily I got into another school with similar but not quite as  good career outcomes (like 25&#37; of class goes to iBanking and Management  consulting vs like 40&#37; at Harvard or Princeton). In particular I remember my  UPenn alumni interview went really really well and I was devastated when  I was waitlisted. Also was bitter for a while because Cornell didn't take  me but took my best friend who was an A- student with 300 pts lower on the SAT than me but White.  
10 years later none of this matters much to my career but I can't help but think how different my future would've looked if I went to a non-target school instead. I likely would've ended up pursuing a career in Engineering or Medicine as opposed to Finance simply because the recruiting networks weren't there.   
If Edward Blum wins his case and proves there were racial quotas of around  20&#37; of class for asian americans at most super-selective colleges, will there be class action lawsuits that harmed students can sign up for?  
Also do yall think this would shift the dial on mba admissions at HBS? I would be very happy if the courts forced universities to publish similar data for their business school with race + gender that something reputable like Propublica or Brookings can dive into and analyze. Based on facebook posts (not a great representative sample which is why I want official data) I have like \~10 female asian finance/consulting friends who've gotten into HBS or Stanford GSB in recent years vs like \~0 asian males with similar careers (but the asian guys are still getting into other schools like Michigan or Booth).

While I'm at it, I wanted to address a new rule for posting in the subreddit. I have had a few users mention to me that we should experiment with a new rule regarding Harvard Extension School posts. A significant percentage of posts about HES tend to be ""ontological""; they are about name HES name recognition, comparative prestige, ""is it real Harvard"", admissions rigor, etc. This is a very tired topic and over-debated (I'm sure you can all agree). I want to be clear that the moderators of this subreddit do not endorse any particular view on these posts, but do seek to curate discussion that is productive instead of adversarial and over-done. To that end:

**The (tentative) new rule (call it Rule 1a) is any HES post must not be ontological as described above**. To be very clear about what this means, here are some examples of HES posts that would and would not be removed under rule 1a.

The types of posts for Rule 1a. are difficult to configure into the automoderator because of the nuanced and complicated nature of how they can be worded. Key words are not good enough. **So, in full transparency, I have added an automoderator rule that requires any HES post (literally containing those key words) to be approved by a moderator before they make it to the subreddit.** This is definitely not ideal, and I don't mean it to be an affront to HES posts, but it's the only way I could figure out to enforce this rule. Rest assured that I will approve your HES posts nearly as soon as they are submitted, as I enabled push notifications for moderator approvals on my phone. We of course want to keep this subreddit open for HES student discussion, news, memes, events, etc. 

As with all other rules, if a moderator decides that the post violates Rule 1a, then a flair will be added to the post indicating as such and it will be removed.

I want to eventually study for a PhD in math but I have a couple of questions, if I may? 


First, obviously Math 55 catches my attention and I would like to take it but I wonder if it might be too overwhelming for my first year. Does anyone have any insight into the workload for that class? If I am eventually going to be introduced to, in other math classes, all of the topics covered in this one class, I don't see it as beneficial to me to suffer through an accelerated class that throws it all at me at once. Can I learn all the topics covered in Math 55 through other math courses at Harvard spread across my undergraduate curriculum?


Second, is it common for undergraduate math students to remain at Harvard for their PhD studies as well? I am very interested in the work of one of the professors at Harvard on computational number theory. I was thinking I would like to study under him for my future PhD.

Thank you.",frvja18,"Math 55 is a very good class if you want to do nothing but math on your spare time. It's not too bad if you've been exposed to higher math before (group theory, rings, modules, manifolds, ...). However, if those are foreign words to you, it will be a very hard class. 

Of course the topics covered in Math 55 are eventually covered later in other courses. In fact, math 55 mostly covers sophomore level math. So it's not particularly advanced; it just moves fast as is a good challenge. 

It is not common for undergrads to stay there for the PhD. The reason is that they want you to explore other places and do math somewhere else. However, if you demonstrate a particular interest in working with a professor there, they are okay with that. But it is still very hard to gain admission!

I possibly could have survived 55, but I didn't feel like I was up to it.  55 is for people who are very, very, very good at math, like, IMO level.  The material is supposed to be roughly the same (except much more) as in the other freshman math classes -- multivariable calculus and linear algebra -- except that the material is approached in a much deeper way and the problems are much more challenging and interesting.  You should take Math 55 if you're God's gift to mathkind, because Math 55 is designed to still greatly challenge you at that level, where all other math classes covering the same material will be less challenging and thus less interesting.  Math 55 is why those people go to Harvard, because they want to have the experience of this class.  But if you're only a mortal, it might just be *too* hard to be as rewarding as it is for them.

I have no idea what things are like now because I'm old, and I have even less idea what things are like now because of COVID, but if they're at all similar to when I was an incoming freshman, there will be *plenty* of help on hand to guide you in figuring out which math courses to take.  55 might be for you, or it might not.

I took a quick read, here's some of the content he had:

> A ‚Äúhate hoax‚Äù is an act of hate ‚Äî racist graffiti, a threatening note ‚Äî which is a hoax in the sense that it was perpetrated by a member (or ally) of the class of people it purports appears to attack. See Pro Publica and Reason for discussion and examples. Let‚Äôs review some examples from Williams history:

> January 1993: Three (anti-black) racist slurs posted on the door of Rice House. Perpetrator turned out to an African-American student. He was suspended for one semester.

> September 2001: Female student reports that she was assaulted in her dorm room. Turns out that she made the whole thing up. I do not think that this truly qualifies as a hate hoax since her intent was probably not to stir up a campus controversy about sexual assault. See discussion below for whether or not the intent of the perp should matter for defining an event as a hate hoax.

> November 2011: Racist note ‚Äî All Niggers Must Die ‚Äî attached to a door in Prospect House. Perpetrator was (almost certainly) an African-American/Hispanic student activist. She was not punished and, to this day, the College maintains the public fiction that this was an actual hate crime.

> November 2012: Racist statement ‚Äî All beaners must die ‚Äî written on whiteboard in Mission. Perpetrator was of ‚ÄúMexican descent.‚Äù As best I can tell, the student was not punished.

> November 2016: Racist graffiti ‚Äî AMKKK, ‚Äúmeant to signify AmeriKKKa, a spelling of America that references racism in our society‚Äù ‚Äî written in red paint in Griffin Hall. Three first year female African-American students were caught, all claiming (plausibly!) to have no connection to the KKK. Students were suspended but did return to Williams.

> Are there other examples I should include?

> As best I can tell, there are about as many hate hoaxes at Williams as there are actual hate crimes. What do readers estimate the proportions to be?

> Even the hate crimes that do not seem to be hoaxes ‚Äî Williams E in 2008, Mills-Dennett 1 in 2009 and Paresky 2014 ‚Äî often seem to be driven by animus whose original source has nothing directly to do with hate . . . but that is a discussion for another day.

I think insinuating that most hate crimes are actually perpetrated by the victims themselves is.... not the best thing. Jeez.

EDIT: another verbatim quote:

>‚ÄúCommitting crimes,‚Äù and almost everything else, is heavily influenced by your genes. Blood will tell. Does Cass not know about this literature?

What qualities do you expect your TF to have, both in general and also specifically during this virtual learning time?

Thank you!",g57bkpk,"Former TF here. My best suggestions, looking back:

* Teach how to triage problems or assignment tasks, i.e. strategies to figure out how to approach a problem. For example, if it's a physics course, how do I figure out which equations are relevant for this problem?
* Give detailed, useful feedback when grading and/or provide a problem set answer key that clearly walks through the process to solving each problem.
* Make your office hours accessible. If it's at a time (or place were it not for remote learning) that's really inconvenient for students, nobody will show. Easier for you if nobody ever comes but not as helpful. If you see someone's struggling, specifically invite them to your office hours to walk through a few problems together.
* If appropriate to the course and you can manage it, think of ways to convey complex concepts that will be relatable to students' real-world intuition. I TFed a thermodynamics course, had some examples about weather that helped people mentally apply the concepts to think about daily life.
* Be aware that if your professor is particularly unskilled instructor (there are a few out there), students will get a lot of their practical learning through you.

Alternative is to use IEMs under ANC headphones. You won't hear a peep out of anyone.",14.0,Gzideck,fh726mq,"You haven't asked for recommendations on noise-canceling headphones, but I thought this might help you out.

Here are my 3 go-to's, in the order of my preference, along with my wife's favorite. Each of these has blue-tooth connectivity for both Apple and Android and also have the ability to connect to multiple blue-tooth devices. Overall, I recommend Sony products over BOSE or Jabra. Here are my personal rankings.

1- Sony WF-1000XM3 (Rose colored). These are in-ear headphones that do an awesome job at noise canceling. They are my primary noise-canceling earbuds/headphones because they perform almost as well as the BOSE below, but are much smaller and their charge lasts forever. You'll need to ensure you get a good fit with the ears though, and some folks won't like the feel of them. I've worn them for about 100 hours, and have never been left with dead batteries. Like most of the Sony products, they have transient, noise-canceling, and also normal modes. The problem is, the transient effect will switch to full-on noise-canceling causing a few seconds delay where you can't hear anything. If you are in an environment where you may need to hear someone randomly talking to you, this is a problem. However, if you use them in transient-mode while on the phone the folks listening to you won't notice. These are also the only USB-C rechargeable headphones on the list, which means they take less time to recharge and is probably why I've never had them go dead.

2 - BOSE Quiet Comfort 35 II Wireless Bluetooth - These are over-the-ear headphones and dominated the noise-canceling arena for years. Because they are over the ear, they do a great job of canceling more noise than the in-ear types. The reason I don't like them as much as the sony WH-1000XM3's is I tend to sweat in my ears when wearing the BOSE.

3 - Jabra Elite Active 65t Earbuds - Normally, I would rate these well, but frankly, the fall out of my ears all the time. Also, the software to control them is crap. That said, they are my only waterproof pair, so you can't fault that. Also, for phone calls, I've found they fade in and out, and I usually need to switch to wired. So, fall out of the ear on airplanes and don't do well on calls... so next-to-last place.

Wife's Favorite: Sony WI-1000X My wife works in a noisy office environment that needs good noise-canceling. However, she also hates the ear-bud thing because she's concerned about losing them. I got her these and they are her daily driver.  She has the same transient-noise-canceling switch issue noted for the earbuds in #1 above.

TLDR: Sony makes great products, and I recommend either the WF-1000XM3 (if you want earbuds) or the Sony WI-1000X (if you want something more secure). I recommend BOSE quiet comfort if you want over-the-ear headphones. If you exercise and want an earbud with noise-canceling that is waterproof, the Jabra Elite is a great choice as long as you make sure you get a good fit in your ear.

eoe0uq,Harvard Crimson,43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Harvard/comments/eoe0uq/harvard_crimson/,2,2020-01-14 01:31:49+00:00,MongolianBotanist,"Last semester was overall a really good one for me. I met so many great people, and I am grateful I was able to so quickly find a niche at the big bustling nerve-wracking world of Harvard.

A big part of that was thanks to the Harvard Crimson, which was far more welcoming and accepting than I could have hoped for. It's truly such a great organization. Its comp process was long and challenging, but my comp directors made the experience completely manageable, light-hearted, and fun. We got to publish multiple articles and benefitted from the experience and expertise of thoughtful, wise editors.

So the Crimson-ICE controversy absolutely broke my heart. On multiple occasions, it brought me to tears. I am a sensitive person, and I try my best to be a moral person. I'm quite left-wing, and strongly support abolish ICE, the decriminalization of immigration, and taking in as many refugees as possible.

And yet I can't escape a simple, clear conviction I have come to: The Crimson was in the right, Act on a Dream in the wrong.

Act on a Dream was absolutely unreasonable in their demands and thoughtless in their actions. The main purpose of a public protest is to demonstrate public support for a cause. The free press has an obligation to scrutinize and duly report on protests, which benefits just social movements by spreading their message and reach. Reaching out to a government agency for comment is never an endorsement of said agencies' actions, nor does it inherently put students in danger. If ICE wanted to prey on undocumented students at Harvard, they would do so regardless of if a comment is asked. ICE's non-comment on the article is demonstrative of their uncaring attitudes to the lives of this country's many brilliant and brave undocumented students. Therefore, the Crimson, without resorting to biased reporting, was able to demonstrate the strength and moral conviction of the Abolish ICE movement in Harvard's community.

Then, Act on a Dream threw that all away by attacking the Crimson for conducting a routine component of journalism. The boycott by various Harvard student groups only did three things: ensure that their efforts and movements would not be reported on with their voice accounted for, cause people both in and outside of the Harvard community to think less of these vital causes, and spread misinformation about the actions and the nature of the Crimson as an organization. I've talked to many students, all otherwise smart and lovely people, who had completely warped views of the situation. Some thought the Crimson literally gave ICE the names of undocumented students, or that we collaborated with them to undermine the protest. I heard people talking about vandalizing the Crimson's headquarters. When people don't trust the Crimson, they will have trouble gaining a full, nuanced perspective on complex campus issues.

Student activists have wasted so much time and effort attacking their fellow students, and allies in making Harvard a fair and just community. It makes me so upset the wasted potential this unnecessary conflict created.

I want us all to move on

So, as an anonymous internet person, I hope that we all can find peace and cooperation in the next semester. I hereby give full, unconditional forgiveness to the people who have slandered my peers, and caused the national press to ridicule the Harvard activist community. I love you all, and I know most of you are good people.

If you want to make a difference on campus, one of the best ways is to comp the Crimson this coming semester. We have a generous financial aid program and do not cut anyone during the comp. All are welcome. Love and mercy everyone.",fecg4ps,[deleted],21.0,None,fecnm92,"I consider myself a strong supporter of journalism, I wrote for my school paper in high school in which I covered issues like trans rights in my town and a local fight to halt a federal energy project. I respect journalism and believe it is a tool for good. That being said...

Journalists do have a moral obligation to protect people they report upon when those people are clearly vulnerable in the situation. War journalists do this often, as do political journalists who use deep background and other methods to protect sources. It‚Äôs not very difficult, when a journalist approaches a conflict between two sides, to evaluate the power imbalance between the sides and adjust tactics accordingly. 

Given ICE‚Äôs (and related agencies) history of silencing dissidents and targeting of university students (see: MIT this week), the Crimson should have understood that blindly reaching out to ICE compromises the safety of students. The Crimson should OF COURSE strive to voice an alternative opinion, but they should have done so via more ethical journalistic methods. The most simple means of doing this is developing a source within the agency for comment on how it‚Äôs reacting without simply reaching out to the agency as a whole. This is pretty standard practice when working on sensitive topics. Journalists, professional or student, cannot pretend they have no obligation to protect those they report upon. Especially when one party in a conflict has a history of retributive terror, it betrays basic journalistic ethics to highlight to that party the vulnerable people who oppose it.

Bottom line, I do actually believe Crimson was in the wrong here. You can argue the student response is overly hostile, but that is a separate argument.

>	The lawsuit Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard University provided an unprecedented look at how an elite school makes admissions decisions. Using publicly released reports, we examine the preferences Harvard gives for recruited athletes, legacies, those on the dean‚Äôs interest list, and children of faculty and staff (ALDCs). Among white admits, over 43% are ALDC. Among admits who are African American, Asian American, and Hispanic, the share is less than 16% each. Our model of admissions shows that roughly three quarters of white ALDC admits would have been rejected if they had been treated as white non-ALDCs. Removing preferences for athletes and legacies would significantly alter the racial distribution of admitted students, with the share of white admits falling and all other groups rising or remaining unchanged.

To absolutely no one‚Äôs surprise, legacy and athlete preferences heavily favor white admits.

From Garett Jones on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GarettJones/status/1174854175378874368):

>	Controlling for academic traits and much else, being Asian American predicts a substantially lower probability of Harvard admission‚Ä¶ And being female predicts a substantially higher probability of admission.

[Here is a fascinating table from the paper](https://i.imgur.com/cdyKuxP.jpg) that for some reason isn‚Äôt really mentioned in the abstract. One thing that surprised me is that if Harvard removed *all race, legacy and athlete* preferences, the number of white admits would actually rise. Unsurprisingly, Asian admits would skyrocket while African-American and Hispanic admits would tank.

I can even say that if my child one day was well qualified and they rejected them, they can forget about any donations or me helping the school out as an alumni. This is what they are worried about. Having a strong alumni network is hugely important for many reasons. Having a bunch of alumni who feel slighted right around when their career potential at its peak is horrible for a school.

We do it because we believe in the power of community as an essential educational force. But that community must be constituted so that it does not simply present you with what you already know or with people whose life experiences and outlooks are just like yours. It is its diversity, its elements of unfamiliarity, its elements of difference that render Harvard College the extraordinary experience that I know you will find it to be. We are excited to welcome you, Class of 2021, because you are in yourselves a great educational machine ‚Äî destined to teach one another ‚Äî and, of course, teach us as well ‚Äî because of the variety of who you are and what you bring. When the admissions office decided on you, it was because they wanted your voice, your contribution as part of this creative cacophony. So don‚Äôt be silent. (And please don‚Äôt live your life online as if you weren‚Äôt here at all!) Engage with one another. Talk a lot so others can learn from you. Listen even more so that you can learn from them. Don‚Äôt be afraid to take the risk of being wrong. Don‚Äôt be afraid to admit you are wrong. It is the best way to learn and grow. And listen generously to others so that they may take risks too. Use the community of your fellow students as one of the greatest gifts and opportunities of your time here. Help us to build at Harvard a model of how people can be enriched rather than divided by their differences.

As you look forward to the upcoming semester, what will you miss the most regarding our campus, student life, events, buildings and other such perks that come with in-person attendance?

Personally, I'm really going to miss events such as *Crimson Jam*, the student-only night at the Harvard Art Museum, various clubs, random events that pop up each semester on bulletin boards around campus and even picking up a copy of The Crimson (should I see one).

I'll definitely miss being able to study in Widener. That place has been a haven for my ability to focus - I'm so much more capable of working in there since it's so quiet and I have less distractions than home. That and it's a a gorgeous building. 

I also have little spots on campus I like to just sit at and read/study. The nook in the top of Sever's Film Library was amazing for that, as was parts of the Science Center.

But I will ***not*** miss dodging selfie sticks and having to find a way around tourists trying to figure out if they can go into X building or not.",g0azdtv,"Miss the most: dhall

You came in wanting to concentrate in English, and thought ""thank god I am in college and dont have to take a math class anymore!"" Not so fast sucker! 

To graduate from this esteemed school you still need to fulfill every hist&lit kids worst nightmare, the QRD. But fear not, I have compiled a list of the easiest classes to skate through this distributional requirement.

&#x200B;

5. Econ 50:

Great intro class that requires basically no knowledge of econ, or math, or coding, or much of anything useful, and since you are a humanities kid thats probably right up your alley. 

4. Math 21b 

Linear algebra, really? It doesn't get much easier than this. y = mx +b, come on, that's baby shit. This is just like learning what lines are, the only tricky part is now they call them vectors‚Äì‚Äìbig whoop. 

3. Applied Math 22a

coming in at just 8 hours of work per week according to the Q guide this is like linear algebra but, like, applied, sounds easy to me. The prof uses the word ""gentle"" in the course description, it doesn't get much easier than that. 

2. Math 23a

So this one is like the baby linear algebra mentioned earlier but now there is some ""real analysis"" tacked on. Oh boy, I go day to day looking at real things, now you want me to analyze them? Cake walk!

1.Math 55a 

""Studies in algebra and group theory""?  Your biggest challenge in this course will be trying to remember the basic algebra you learned in like 6th grade. The group theory portion? The perfect prep for blocking groups. 

Some people claim this is the hardest math class in the country, but thats mostly hype so people dont figure out how easy this class is. I hear 100% of the 10% of kids who don't drop the class, get A's, so you are basically 100% guaranteed to get an A!
